         By John Baltharpe, belonging to the foresaid Ship.
         With Alowance.
         London, Printed by E. C. for T. Vere, at the Angell without Newgate. 1671.
      
      
         
         
            
             the Right Worshipful Captain Thomas Darcy Esq; late Commander of his Majesties Frigot, The Dartmouth.
         
            YOu Sir John Harmans second, Sir have been,
            All this same Voyage, therefore you have seen,
            The things here treated on, and more
            Off these Transactions, part have bore
            Too high a share for my poor Pen to write
            I want expressions to set out the height
            Of your brave Actions; pray excuse
            The dullness of my Pen, and Muse.
            I wish the Seafare you had mounted:
            Then she a Frig at had been counted
            Ʋnto this hour, except pale Death,
            Ʋnluckely had stopt your breath.
            
               
I'm sure good Fight▪ Sir, you would make
            Both for your King and Countries sake:
            The Turks could never then a vaunted,
            An English Frigat to a daunted:
            'Tis not the Ship, nor yet the Guns,
            Although she were a thousand Tuns;
            But the brave Captain and his Seamen,
            That fights like Englishmen, & Freemen
         
         
            There is no Poetry exact
            In these same Lines within, compact,
            But such as 'tis, I pray receive,
            No further favour I do crave;
            Except it be to kiss your hand,
            Who am your Servant to command.
         
         
            John Balthrape.

         THE Straights Uoyage OR, St. Davids Poem.
         Beginning May, 1669.
         
            
               COncerning of the David Saint,
               And her Straights Voyage I'le you acquaint,
               From Chatham River we did sail,
               And concequently through the Swail.
               The first Place we did our Anchor lowre,
               By Seamen call'd The Boy oth' Oare;
               Where we that night did press some Men:
               
                  rom Merchants Ships, Barbado's Men:
               
                  or Man'd we were from Chatham-River,
               With such a Crew as you saw never,
            
            
               There was Rope-makers and their Boyes,
               The Dockmen-Labourers made an noise;
               We had a pretty handsome Hoast,
               That of their Straights-Voyage could not boast
               
                  or when we came to'th Boy o'th Oare,
               Our Long-boat put them all a Shoare;
               
                  
And there she Grounded that same Tide,
               Well moar'd in Sand she fast did Ride.
            
            
               Into the Hope we got at last,
               Where the St. David we Moar'd fast;
               It was about the first of June,
               When Sun declines i'th After-noon:
               Two hundred Men, rather more then less,
               That very Month we then did Press.
            
            
               From the Black-Indies-men we gat,
               Brave lusty Seamen, plump and fat,
               Out of the Hold these Men we hurried,
               For down i'th Coals they deep were buried▪
               Saies the Ship-master, on my word,
               I've naught but these same Boyes a-board:
               Some Cripples wouid appear in fight,
               They knew that we such men did slight:
               Some men with great beards would appeare,
               What would you firs, lo, I am here,
               I hope that I me too old and weak,
               To serve the King, you won't me take,
               All my young daies I've spent in's Service,
               'Tis very true, my name is Jarvis.
               Such a one, I've great charge upon my life,
               Of Children dear, and a sick Wife.
               What should we say to such, we let them pass,
               Though naught they said to us true was;
               When we were gone, at us they'd laugh,
               And tother Bottle they would quaff,
               Till we their Iuging tricks found out,
               Aud then we put them to the rout.
               
                  
When we such Old-men prest again,
               The self-same reasons they would fain.
               But we gave small Credit to their word,
               By reason that we had Aboard,
               A Barber-Surgeon, which could Cure,
               Three such Old-men, in half an Houre:
               Though they had Beards great like a Brush,
               There's no excuse then worth a Rush.
               For men of Thirty years of Age,
               Great Beards had got like any Sage.
               So much of these Black Indies men,
               Next we will Treat of Merchant-men.
               They brave Excuse would us present,
               Drawn up in Language fine and quaint:
               When we Aboard those Ships drew near,
               The Master would straightway appear;
               Make haste, there give the Boat a Rope
               My men, I, all shall ave, I hope.
               Master Coxon, welcome here Aboard,
               I wish, I could you Men afford:
               I very long from Port have been,
               Stopt always with contrary Wind;
               My Men are sick, weak, very Lean,
               We at short Lowance, long have been:
               Boy, bring a Bottle, this I got,
               Since I within the Downs was shot.
               In Dover Road, upon my word,
               I could you not one drop afford.
               A man might answer, nor now, neither,
               'Tis only for to make Fair weather.
               
                  
Sometimes we take this same Excuse,
               They us can't, very well abuse;
               For some of us unto the Seas,
               Have served our Times, as well as they,
               And unto Lying do I say,
               Know what belongs as well as they.
               When with a Straights-man we do meet,
               To go on Board, we think it fit;
               The Captain he looks very Bluff,
               The Seamen clad all in stript Stuff.
               What come yea for? Friends I tell yea,
               No men I have Aboard here for yea:
               Cause he hath got bove Forty men,
               And we in the Boat, have only Ten;
               He thinks with Number, us to Scare,
               But he's mistaken quite, I Swear.
               Our Frigot she doth Ride so nigh,
               That for her Shot, they can't get by.
               Sometimes they do so Rugged prove,
               They into Anger turn our Love.
               We cut his Haliards, and Shankpainter,
               Lets flie his Stopper, brings her to an Anchor.
               Lets our Commander know his Pride,
               Then he under our Stern must Ride:
               We in our Anger, takes his men,
               But when 'tis Calm, gives them again.
               Of small Craft, we Aboard also,
               To seek Seamen oftimes do go.
               Where many of the Female kind,
               For Passengers, we oft do find:
               
                  
Seamen they'l hide, they are so kind,
               Even underneath their Coats behind.
               No thoughts we had of finding Men,
               When we plaid Under-board with them:
               But some we found, even just and jump,
               With Nose to thinking, close to Rump:
               Which 'mongst our men, caused great laughter
               And they were often told on't after.
               Enough is said concerning Pressing,
               We oft are pretty Maids Confessing;
               If underneath their Coats so wide,
               They do not some stout Seamen hide▪
               If they have none, they'l up be gone,
               Shaking their Coats, no, I have none;
               What think you that young men come there,
               You very much mistaken are.
               If guilty then, they blush amain,
               To see how truly they are tane:
               Down on their Mary▪bones they'l hover,
               Be kind good Sir, he is my Brother;
               But all this while he is her Lover.
               Enough is said, I could say more,
               For I have slept even at my Oare▪
               So weary have I been a Pressing,
               Both night and day, even without seising.
               A thankless Office 'tis I swear
               It, from hence forth I will forbear:
               Except that there be great occasion,
               By forreign Nations Invasion:
               And then what men can stand, and see,
               
                  
The ruine of his Country.
               I am perswaded for my part,
               A valiant heart must sufter smart:
               To see his Country go to ruine,
               And he that while is nothing doing;
               Against these Pirates of Algeir,
               Indeed I much concerned were;
               Because, I by them Rogues was taken,
               Though I had Friends, was not forsaken.
               'Gainst them I made a Vow that hour,
               That I would plague them to my power.
               A Year and half, they kept me there,
               After that period Ransom'd were:
               By my▪own Friends, for I compacted,
               With a London Merchant, and contracted:
               For every piece of Eight he paid,
               Five shillings English down was laid;
               But first of all we must to Court,
               With Creatures strange of several sort,
               For to present unto the King;
               These things to White-Hall we did bring,
               Which forth the Straights in Zebulan,
               Captain Hunt Commander did bring then;
               There was Red-ey'd Pidgeons, Turtle Doves,
               And Antelops, which Kings they love:
               The King most graciously, lent ear
               To us, that Slaves were in Argeir,
               And paid our Ransomes every penny,
               Our Friends, from purses was not any.
               I have serv'd the King, and eke my Nation,
               
                  
From that time after, in my Station;
               My bouden Duty it was so,
               A thankful Person lesse can't do.
            
            
               This by the by: But now let's pass,
               To see Transactions what they was.
               After the Pressing of our Men,
               What Course Sterde we, I wonder then:
               What thing of Note did us befall,
               That I took notice next of all,
               Was when we hal'd our Boat a shoare.
               Gainst there, where we our Ship did moar.
            
            
               First, we her clean'd, all things compleat,
               She Tallowed was most fine and neat;
               When we had done, her Blacking was not dry,
               twould stick upon the cloths of them came nigh
               Therefore we let her stand upon the stocks,
               & to Clift town we went, ne'r thought of knoks
               But knockt we were, and that most soundly,
               Though we stood too it pretty roundly;
               For they were ten to one, I'me sure,
               I should not lye if I said more:
               This quarrel it did first begin,
               As we sat merrily a drinking:
               One simple Fellow of our Crew,
               Told there a Towns-man he him knew
               To be a Seaman; and that he
               With him some time had been at Sea:
               This foolish Fellow would him Press,
               He told him he could do no no lesse.
               At this the Fellow swears, and tears,
               
                  
Sets all the Town about our ears;
               Away they come with Crickets, Bats,
               And knockt us down like unto Rats;
               There came a Barber with his Pole,
               And knockt me down upon my soul:
               Nay, this of all did vex me worse,
               The: women they did at us curse,
               Crying out Presse-masters, ah ye Rogues,
               Be gone from Town you arrant Dogs.
               One quarter part of us knew not,
               What all this time we Quarrell'd at:
               That night they half of us Secur'd;
               The other half they got A-board.
               Betimes i'th Morning, to our view,
               There did appear a lusty Crew;
               The Towns-men they began to tremble,
               And fetcht us beer, they did desemble:
               Comes one poor Woman, truly I
               Did▪ you no harm, I know not why
               You were secur'd in this same Place,
               'Twill last (I'me sure) but a little space.
               A Prophetesse she was, I think,
               For 'fore that we one Pot could drink,
               Lieutenant Soundèrs, brought us word,
               Sir John would speak with us aboard.
               Then out of Wooden-Prison came we,
               I was right glad, you could not blame me.
               Now Sirs, I this to you will show,
               When that the Townsmen they did know;
               That we were Sir John Harmans men,
               
                  
They could have wisht us out again▪
               But seeing they had gone so far,
               And 'gainst us had proclaimed War;
               Ambassador they then did chuse,
               Their Minister who wont refuse
               Unto Sir John, them to excuse.
               And by his Arguments so sound,
               He closed had, at last their Wound:
               To his Parishoners he came,
               And told them, he had lain the blame
               On the Boats-Crew, and therefore,
               He would us punish very sore.
               He no true Prophet was in this,
               Sir John was wiser, I do wis:
               Then punish Ten, for one mans fault
               Whose Name is called Master Maul▪
               Some call him Sir John Barlycorn,
               Chuse which you will; he had out-worne
               Our patience quite, at that same 
               
               And mad us Act things out of Rea
               
               Captain Dangerfield, some do him 
               
               When he gets Mastery oyer all:
               The very Reason he Captives▪ 
               'Tis never good when that he 
               
               Our Friends he oftimes makes our Foes▪
               By him oftimes we do get Blows▪
               Therefore I pray, don't with him 
               
               At last he makes a man a Beast.
               Where are you running? Hold my M
               
               Let's these things following now 
               
               
                  
Sir John Harman, he Aboard us came,
               That day that we did act the same.
               Our Flag at Mizen-top-mast head,
               To rights, a nimble young-man spread:
               The David Saint, sure now is proud,
               Undaunted Sermen shout aloud;
               And willingly they would to work,
               To fight against the faithless Turk.
               But that same Flag wan't all her pride,
               She had a sute of Pendants tide,
               At each Yard one, White, Red, Blew,
               Methoughts they made a goodly shew.
               Our Officers, if I should name,
               Methinks I were not much to blame:
               Captain, Liuetenant, under Sir John,
               Is by his Name, call'd Saunderson:
               Liuetenant Stout, well known to Fame,
               Our Master, Marshal is his Name.
               Samuel Hatfield, is our Boatswain's Name,
               He's man enough, I'le say the same:
               With Silver Call, on Deck he stands,
               Winds it, make haste, aloft more Hands,
               Come on my Lads, look to your Gear,
               Be sure that we have all things clear▪
               Albian Howel, we our Gunner call,
               The grandest charge he hath of all:
               He gives our Guns their Lowance in such sort,
               That they do give a good Report.
               Our Carpenter, is call'd Elias Waffe,
               A tite Ship we don wnt, that's praise enough.
               
                  
Our one Eye'd Cook, is nam'd George Drake,
               No more of him I do mean to speak.
               July the first, we Sailed from,
               The Hope, where we had Rid so long:
               Guns at that time were Fired some,
               For joy that they had got our Room:
               Away that Tide, with merry Gale,
               We to the Boy-oth'-Oare, did Sail:
               Next day we over the Flats stood,
               But Anchor did in Margret-Road.
               Into the Downs, upon my word,
               We did Arrive July the third:
               July the fourth, being Sabbath-day,
               Our Streamers all we did display.
               The Roe Buck Ambral, here did Ride,
               With other men of War beside.
               That very day we went a Shoar,
               To fetch our Parson and some more.
               That left at Chatham were behind,
               They unto us were very kind.
               One Midship-man, named Captain Mintren,
               That Rid in company with our Parson;
               Cause that his Horse he would not Sail,
               So well as the Parsons, but did fail:
               Pen-knife pulls out, Curses, and Swears,
               And Cuts off one oth' Horses Ears.
               Saying, base Jade, What wont you Sail?
               Next time you faulter, ware your Tale.
               And he made but a merry Jest,
               In thus abusing harmless Beast.
            
            
               
                  
July the sixth from Downs we Sail,
               But got we had Westerly Gale,
               Which made us Anchor Tide, and Tide,
               But so to Wind-ward we still ply'd,
               That on the tenth of that same July,
               We saw Sir Thomas Allen truly,
               At the Spit-head where he did Ride,
               With several Men of War beside:
               That day some Powder it was burn'd,
               And into nothing it was turn'd,
               Upon Salluts as is the fashion,
               Of our Sea-faring English Nation;
               If Guns Eleven we him give,
               Two lesse be sure we shall receive:
               Sir Thomas being Admiral,
               We must salute him first of all;
               Sir Edward Spragge we next salute,
               Because Vice-Admiral, hath repute.
               All other Captains, but them two,
               Salute us first, as is our due.
               About a Fortnight we did Ride,
               In Portsmouth Road, calld Spit-qead,
               Where we did get what things we want,
               Good Beer and Brande was not scant,
               With them which Money had, for they would buy,
               They which had none would pass away.
               One thing of note I told yea not,
               I had it almost quite forgot,
               Our Fidlar did in Triumph fetch,
               Mis Fiddle from Aboard a Ketch
               
                  
Call'd the Portsmouth, and did play,
               Oft times to pass the time away;
               Sometimes to passe sad Cares away,
               On Fore-castle we dance the Hay;
               Sometimes Dance nothing, only hop about,
               It for good Dancing passes mongst the rout;
               Yet on my word, I have seen Sailors,
               More nimbler Dance, then any Taylors.
            
            
               When we in Portsmouth Road did Ride,
               I went a Shoar on Gospar side;
               For there Acquantance I had got,
               With them I meant to crack a Pot;
               An Hostess, she but of course fashion,
               Yet honest woman by relation,
               She needs would stop my cloths a shoare,
               For an old Reckning on the score;
               But I was no such Fool I think,
               To let my Clothes be stopt for Drink;
               But off the Hedge I my self took them,
               And aboard that night I bravely brought them.
            
            
               The Wind being fair we did break ground,
               And sailed next for Plymouth Sound,
               July the two and twentieth day,
               We Anchor dropped in the Bay:
               That very night we waigh'd again,
               Bound over for the Coast of Spain,
               The Wind being fair, we Hoise a trip,
               Our Top-sails, and away we skip:
               Adieu fair England, now adiew,
               To War we go gainst Barborous Crew
               
                  
Of Turkish Pirats; Grant Successe
               Thou God of Battle, and us blesse,
               That we those Pirats may confound,
               And give Algeir a deadly wound.
               On Deck I stood, and by Moon-light,
               Of England that same night lost sight;
               Farewel fair England, thrice farewel,
               There all my Frinds, and Kinsfolks dwell,
               Heaven knows when ever it will be,
               That I their faces more shall see:
               Gods-will be done, to Sea I'me bound,
               Farewel sweet England, Plimouth Sound,
               And all the Places on a Row,
               That kindnesse unto me did show.
            
            
               With fair Wind and a pleasant Gale,
               We unto Bay of Bulls did Sail,
               In Moneth of August the sixth day,
               We Anchor droped in the Bay.
               The Spaniards brought us Wine A-board,
               Bread, Grapes, Fig-cheeses they aford▪
               Either for Money or Truckar;
               For six Royals they I sell a Jarr,
               They'l bargin make Wino per te;
               Again reply Jarro per me:
               They ply'd their business very close,
               Most of our men they got a doss;
               Next day before that it was night,
               Some of our Men were drunk out right.
               The first day of this Month, at Sea,
               To short Allowance then went we;
               
                  
What Meat before the King for four,
               Allow'd, now six men it devour;
               A Dollar o each man is due,
               Each twenty and eight days 'tis true:
               When we can get it, we drink Wine,
               Healths to their Freinds then we combine.
               A Seaman when he gets Ashoar,
               In one days time he spendeth more;
               Then three months stort-allowance Money,
               Perhaps he gets a Spanish Cony.
               It may be not only in Wine,
               He drinks till he is almost blind,
               And then, The Spaniards picks his Pocket,
               If nought be there, he takes his Jacket.
               Some Spaniards they no Conscience makes,
               To Rob an Englishman, he takes
               What Guilt he hath; another goes,
               And strips him, takes away his Clothes.
               This when he's Drunk, if he be Sober,
               He need not fear a Spanish Rover.
               I have seen one man with Boat-hook-staff,
               Made Five to run, it made me Laugh:
               Though they were Arm'd with Swords compleat,
               Amain they from him did Retreat:
               Enough of these pilfering Culls,
               When parted we from Bay a Bulls.
               August the tenth, we Sail'd away,
               And Anchored at Tangier next day:
               A place the English now possess,
               On the Barbarian Shoar it is.
               
                  
Tis fortyfied very strong
               Or else we should not keep it long:
               There doth also a Mold here stand,
               Where: Ships may Ride within Command;
               'Tis Fortyfied two Miles long,
               With Towers also Exceeding strong,
               In each of which good Guns doth stand,
               To drive ay the Moores by land;
               Of which sometimes there doth appear,
               More then one hnndred thousand in one year▪
               Enough of Tangeir, now lets turn our Tale
               From thence that night we did set Sayl,
               Bound up the Streights, away we went,
               To meet with▪ Algeir Turks was our intent.
               We with our Squadron kept a Board,
               The Christian Shore, upon my word.
               Sir Thomas Allen steers along
               Mid Channel, with his Squadron.
               Sir Edward Spragg with Ships of Warr,
               Did keep along the Barbary Shoare.
               These Flaggs-all three agreed were,
               To meet together at Argeir;
               Because those Rogues and we did jarr,
               To make: with them perpetnal Warr;
               We scorne with them to be Peace seekers,
               Who are such Rougish peace breakers,
               We sayl'd the Coast of Spain along,
               With Ships of Warr well man'd and strong;
               At length Alteirs appear'd in sight,
               Sir Thomas Allen and the Fleet,
               
                  
That then were with him, they got water,
               We some did get presently after;
               When we from Sea approached nigh,
               A board with water they did hie,
               That we might over with them steer.
               Unto that Pirats Town Argeir.
               We sayl'd away, and that same night,
               Of Spanish Land we did loose sight.
               The very first day of September,
               We saw Argeir, I well remember:
               We came to Algeir road with hammocks down,
               Yeds slung, the Trumpets they did sound,
               Into the Road we steer'd stedde,
               All for a stout Encounter ready;
               Of this same Town we took a view,
               And thought upon the Roughish crew,
               That do inhabit in that Cell,
               The Number of them who can tell,
               For as you do the Streets come nigh,
               You scarce can for the Press get by;
               They march so thick as Army were,
               A going out to some great Warr.
               The Turks they sooth us up with treaty,
               They smooth us up most fine and neatly,
               Till they have brought about their ends,
               And then they care not to be freinds;
               Money which they did take away,
               From the East-Indies Man: They say
               They cannot heple: for he that took
               The same away: Hath them forsook,
               
                  
The Moneyes shar'd amongst three hundred,
               How they shonld get, i'ts to be wondred,
               Out of the bellies of so many,
               And therefore we an't like to have any:
               To some Things they would condescend,
               To other Things they would not bend;
               So in conclusion we did Jarr,
               And gainst them we proclamed Warr.
               On nights in Boats upon the Waves,
               Near Shoar we lye to take up Slaves:
               Some Boats of Corn, laden for Argeir
               We took, as they the Shoar drew near:
               One Boat I very well remember,
               It was about the middle of September,
               Dark in the Night, under the Shoar,
               As we lay sculking on our oare,
               Near to the Shoar (as he came creeping)
               We Boarded him, a Woman weeping
               With a young Child, sate after on▪
               The Turks and Moores over board run.
               We went to fishing then for Moores,
               And took them up with blades of Oares;
               The flesh of some, with our Boat-hook,
               We entered, and so up them took:
               At last we took up quite so many,
               That there did not escape us any.
               One night as we lay waiting there,
               Under the Shoar at day appear,
               A Fleet of Surkish Boats which come,
               Thinking our our Boats to over run:
               
                  
                  or all they were bove four to one,
               
                  et with our Muskets we went on,
               
                  nd stood to it with Blunderbus,
               Gainst them for all their Harquibus▪
               When the Turks saw us so Valliantly,
               Come on with so much Gallantry,
               Thay could not long endure our Force,
               But straightway Turn'd their backs to us▪
               And then like Cowards run away,
               Into the bottom of the Bay:
               Then out unto their Aid did come
               A Ericantine, well Man'd and Gun'd;
               Indeed of him we stood in fear,
               Cause that he had got great Guns there,
               Which farr over our Boats would come,
               But our small Shot would not reach home.
               Captain Darcy now espying this,
               In Dartmouth, which but fifth Rate is,
               Let slip his Cable, and made hast,
               This Pirats Bricantine to bast;
               His part he played that same day,
               Most gallantly without delay;
               His Guns did at the Turks Boats roar,
               Which made them turn their Heads ashoar▪
               No trust in Mahomet they had,
               Their countenances were very sad.
               For fear the Wind should faulter then,
               The Dartmouth she stood off agen:
               When they Espyed her about,
               Down to their Boats in a great Rout
               
                  
They did them high, thinking to gain
               Argeir Town, fore that they were tane:
               And so they did Rowing close by the Shoar
               As ever they could do for Oare;
               Captain Darcy did let broad-sides fly,
               Amongst their Boats perpetually,
               He sent them to Mahomets Wherry,
               No cause they had for to be merry,
               For Charon to his Stygeon-Lake
               Mahometans do alwaies take.
               The Ships, Forts, Castle, all did Fire
               At him, being mov'd much to Ire.
               But he at all was not dismaid,
               In their own Coin he them repaid,
               And gave them Shot for Shot therefore,
               He naught would put upon the score:
               Had Charles our King no Captains worse,
               They would not have our Nations Curse;
               As had that Sea-fares Captain, who
               Ran's Ship A-shoar, he naught would do,
               Neither for King, nor Countries sake,
               But all to peeces Kings-ship brake;
               Base Cowardize, unworthy Man,
               More fit to ride in a Sedan,
               Then for to Mount a brave Kings-Ship,
               He rather doth deserve a Whip.
            
            
               Whilst we lay here, even at noon day,
               A Portugall escapt away;
               In Garden of his Pateroone
               He was a working about noon;
               
                  
                   Boate he seeing neer the Shoare
               
                   straightways did his work give o're,
               
                  d was resolved for to dye,

                  rough presse of Turks and Moores he then
               
                  d run with Pruning Knife in hand,
               
                  ost like a Valiant man and stout,
               
                  d every way did lay about.
               
                   means whereof he free did make,
               
                   passage and we in him take;
               
                  me fifty years of Age was he,
               
                  hen thus he gain'd his liberty.
               
                  d was Eleven years a Slave,
               
                  nto a Tagareene base Knave;
               
                  ow understand whilst we lay here,
               
                  efore this Pirats Town Argeir,
               
                  t Sea they Ships of Warr had then:
               
                  hich harmed much poor Merchant-Men.
               
                  r John Harmon he well known to Fame:
               
                  ppointed was to Guard the same
               
                  is care it was exceeding much,
               With them he always would keep touch:
               
                  ake easie Sayl on Nights therefore,
               
                  n Nights he bore the Light before.
               
                  is Chickens alwayes who close clings

                  n dayes perhaps they'l wander, yet keep sight.
               Of their Rare Admirall if ought them fright,
               As oft it hapneth, doth the Ravenou's Kite;
               Under her wings they are at Night,
               
                  
The Darmoth was St. Davids second,
               Though but a small Ship she is reckon'd:
               The Captain hath a heart as great,
               As if he were in a Third Rate:
               A Pendent always she did bear,
               At Mizen-top-mast-head most fair.
               To shew the World, she did belong,
               Unto the Squadron of Sir John.
               The fifth day of October we,
               With Dartmouth in our company:
               From Argeire Pirats-town set Sail,
               With pretty fresh Southerly Gale.
               And over for the Spanish Shoar,
               We bent our Course with speed therefore:
               For Water at that time Aboard,
               Was little left upon my word;
               For Jversey we steer therefore,
               Making account for to get more.
               The eighth of October we,
               Did Anchor dropt at Jversey:
               But Prodick they wont us afford,
               Cause that our Guns wont speak one word.
               First in a fashion of Salute,
               'Tis true, our Iron-Dogs were mute.
               I know no reason why that we,
               Englands Rere-Admiral on the Sea;
               A petty Governour should salute,
               Of Islands, that's of no Repute.
               From Jversey next day we steer,
               And bend our Course next, towards Alteere.
               
                  
Here stands a Castle at Alteere,
               Upon a Hill, by the water nere,
               Which hath Three Gunns upon occasion,
               If Turks should make on them Invasion:
               As for Salutes, they do not care;
               You need not fear of Prodick there.
               From the Eastward, this same place doth want
               But Six Leagues, unto Alicant;
               Good Water fresh there in a River▪
               Small neck of Land, from Salt doth sever;
               This place it is upon the Maine,
               In Countrey of the King of Spaine.
               On Fourteenth of that same October
               We came to Alicant moreover
               Beveridge we got in steed of Beer
               Good Red Wine that same was I sweare
               A Shore at this same Alicant
               A Frolique rare I did not want
               An English Fidlar I'le forget his Name,
               Did leave his Fiddle saying take the same,
               If I return not by and by:
               I do not know the reason why;
               But he returned not that same Night:
               Before next Day appear'd in sight,
               Cause he that Night went to a W—
               And to us he would come no more,
               His Fiddle paid Six Rialls score.
               At this he Frett, he Fomed, he Wept,
               'Twas ne're the ne're to be perplext;
               Kings Ship this fellow leaves, poor Asse,
               
                  
For Service of a Spanish Lasse,
               Where he perhaps the Pox may get
               He'l time then have to repent it.
               Enough concerning this same bout,
               Let's other Matters now look out,
               The Dartmouth's unto Dena gone,
               To bring some Merchant Ships along;
               When they came in we did not stay,
               But straight ways did our Anchors waigh;
               Our Prison called the Bilboes,
               In this Road over Board they goes;
               This Ox Blood had so warm'd their Pates
               That they did act things at strange Rates:
               Likewise some of our Trumpeters crew
               Their Trumpets over board they threw,
               To sound a Levate as twas reason
               Unto the drown'd Bilboes Prison,
               The Nineteenth of October we
               From Alicant did put to Sea
               With Dartmouth and our Convoyes goe,
               With all our speed for Mathago:
               But with bad Wind being overtane,
               We stopt one day at Catergeane;
               But there we did get no Recrute,
               Because we did not them Salute.
               We did not then at all there stay▪
               But next day we did Sayl away,
               Where the next thing that fell of Note;
               Was meeting with a Catches Boate,
               By Bricantine then of the Moore▪
               
                  
This Catch that day was put a shoare,
               We that same day for Pilchards Fish,
               In hold of this same little Ketch;
               This little fish we rost and broyle,
               In Cook Roome, there was such a Coyle,
               As if a prize then we did take,
               Our men did such a quarter make,
               This same October Malhago we
               The eight and twentieth day did see;
               The twenty ninth day Malhago Sack
               They which had Money, did not lack;
               More Merchant Ships we here did take,
               And Guarded them for the Southard Cape.
               Upon the first day of November
               We sayl'd away I well remember,
               With Merchants Ships all in a row
               The Dartmouth she a-Sterne did goe,
               Brought up the Rere, we went a head,
               Brave Fleet of Merchant Ships we led,
               Through the Straights mouth, upon the fourth
               Of that November we came forth.
               On the fifth day upon my word,
               We lost a poor man over board;
               He from our Anchor then did fall,
               It was a strong Levant with all
               Our yaul we got into the Sea
               To save (if possibly could we)
               Poor man, our boat-swaine also he
               The yaul did steere in raging Sea
               He took great care do all he can,
               
                  
The Waves had swallowed up the man;
               He other Sepulcure cannot have
               The raging Sea it was his Grave.
               For all we were in such a tosse,
               His Wife and Children finde the losse,
               In Greenwich Town, nere London Citty,
               They poorely now must live, tis pitty;
               The life of Man is but a bubble
               As is before the Plough the Stubble,
               It over in the furrow turnes,
               Or else perhaps the same they burnes;
               Great Care and Cost there is bestown
               In's bringing up, but he is gone
               In less then one poor Minutes Space,
               This same of Mortals is the case.
               That same November the sixth day,
               From Merchant ships we part away.
               They good Wind had with merry Gale
               Unto old England they did Sayl.
               But we to Cáles our course did shape,
               From Saint Vincents the South-ward Cay.
               Some of those Pirats of Argeir
               Into our sights they did appear;
               We straight ways after them did stand
               But way for fear a pace they rnn;
               Good 'twas for them that (whorsbirds) 
               
               Could like to Lightning run away:
               One after that a wholes dayes space
               We followed, and did give him Chase;
               At this same time more Saile we bore
               
                  
Then ever since, or here to fore:
               Top-Gallon, stay Sayls, out they went
               All Sayls that we could now invent;
               In Chase of these same Pirats we
               No pains did spare that time at Sea:
               Canvis we had out that same hour,
               Two thousand yeards and eighty four,
               And eke seven hundred yeards also,
               But yet them Rogues from us did goe.
               But had not Night a been so nigh,
               We one had got assuredly.
               The seventeenth of that same November
               In Cales Road we did drop our Anchor;
               Next day the old trade it proceeded;
               The Spaniards brought what things we needed
               Except twere Money that they sold,
               At dearer Rares then can be told:
               We tasted of the Spanish Jarr,
               Which in our brains did breed such warr,
               That we did talke of things that never.
               In all our lives, concerned us ever.
               Here we did water, nothing was scant,
               What things we had we did not want.
               Novembers twenty seaventh day
               We part then did from Cales away
               With Mérchants ships bound for the Straights;
               Unto Legorne, and please the Fates,
               The Dartmouth's gone fore to Tangeir,
               To hear how Causes they stood there.
               A Prize that Night under the Shore
               
                  
From English taken was before,
               She took a Pincke loaden with carriage,
               Of Reasons for to make Plum-Pottage.
               But we did Sayl her up the Straights,
               And eat their Reasons for their sakes,
               A Bakers dozen of those Moores
               We took, which row with Gally Oares,
               And we them sold at Legorne Port,
               Because we had good Reason for't:
               It was dark night, we see could not,
               VVhen Dartmouth this same Prize had got:
               But through Straights mouth we sayled ne
               
               The Garrison called Tangeir;
               And on December the first day,
               VVe gained Malhagoe I say.
               Old trade proceeded as before,
               Good Malhagoe we drunk therefore;
               This Sack indeed our witts did puzzle.
               Because too much ont, we did guzzle.
               VVithin two dayes the Dartmouth brought
               In Triumph, prize which she had caught;
               A fier ship of her they made,
               By reason now hereafter said:
               Two days before they came us nigh
               Four Sayl of ships they did espy,
               VVhich forth the Straights came stem, for stem
               For Turks ships then, they did take them
               But Captain Darcy second I say,
               For Turkes Ships for to run a way:
               But prize to fier Ship did turne,
               
                  
                  esolving one of them to burne,
               
                  nd fight the rest with Courage bold,
               
                  rave English heart wont be controul'd:
               For faithlesse Turkes to run a shore:
               Though they were four to one and more▪
               But when he came them very nigh,
               For French-men he did them espy,
               VVith Guns all out and all things cleer,
               He did approach these French-men nere:
               For he to Colours that doth trust,
               May lay his honour in the dust.
               VVith Turks I sayld a year and more,
               Their tricks I know full well therefore;
               For they all sorts of Colours have,
               By means whereof themselves they save
               Oftimes, and also they do cheate,
               Poor Merchantmen by that same Feate.
               The French were four Ships stout and tall
               The Dartmouth one which was but small
               They wondred he'd abide them sight,
               And would not bear up and make flight.
               They mainly did commend him for it,
               That he was Captain of such Spirit;
               And him Saluted in best fashion,
               For honour of our English Nation.
               Captain Darcy, they did Presents bring,
               And Honour on him they did fling.
               He part, did from them, then I say,
               And came to Malagoe next day,
               With Prize in Tow, most brave and boldly,
               
                  
Even just as lately, I have told yea.
               The Sixth day of the same December,
               We Sail'd from Malagoe, I remember:
               Finding a strong Levant at Sea,
               We put in next for Almare:
               And there we did Careen our Ship,
               The Saylors on the Yards did skip:
               Each Commendations of the other,
               A lost they gave, some this, some t'other,
               Pastimes with Girles, they then discover.
               The Purser they cry up a high,
               For honest Man; but answer Lie;
               Of Stewards honesty, and his Mate,
               They loudly on the Yards do Prate:
               It was December the Tenth day,
               When we did Anchor here I say:
               Next day we Sail'd towards Alicant,
               But fair Wind that time we did want:
               But yet we did without delay,
               Gain Alicant the Thirteenth day:
               Where we a storm of Wind did Ride,
               About the Spaniards, Christmas-Tide.
               Sheet Anchor we did let from Bow,
               Because the Wind did fairely Blow.
               The Spaniards they came off with Boats,
               With Wine, Bread, Grapes, things of all sorts;
               With Wine▪ Bread, Grape, & their Fig-cheeses,
               They Money forth our Pockets squeeses;
               Old Trade proceeded as before,
               VVe gave them Guilt in hand therefore.
               
                  
                  me were quite Drunk, and some were Sober,
               
                  nd some were also half Seas over.
               
                  pon December Twentieth day,
               
                  rom hence then we did Sail away:
               
                  n the same place we left it standing,
               
                  Vhere we do find it at our Landing.
               The Merchant Ships with us did Sail,
               
                  ound towards Legorne, with merry Gale;
               But four days after we did want,
               No wind but fair, one which was scant.
               And ne're unwelcome is to Seamen,
               For by that means he is a Freeman:
               From toylsom Labour, and sad Care,
               VVhich winds cantrary bring for fare.
               The Five and Twentieth as some say,
               Of this Month called Christmas-day:
               Our Fidler then did Play, and Sing,
               At Cabin door, made Steerage ring.
               VVith cheerful Voice, bid them good morrow,
               I think that he did Verses borrow:
               From some fam'd Poet, for he'd fing,
               Brave merry Songs, made all to ring.
               VVith VVeather stormy, winds contrary,
               VVe bore up Helm, now for Calery,
               VVhich on Sardina Island stands,
               But where Ships rides there naught commands.
               VVhen Ships do near unto them come,
               Into the Mountains they do run:
               Till they are sure we are no Turks;
               Then down they come and Trade with us.
               
                  
It was December's Thirtieth day,
               When we did Anchor here I say:
               We for one Dollar, or four Shilling,
               Might buy a Sheep, if but so willing:
               Nothing else here was to be had,
               The Wine was hard and very bad.
               It was January, the Third, day,
               When towards Legorn we Sail'd away;
               Great talk there's now of Legorn Ladies,
               Some swore that they would get them Baby▪
               But sted of Babies they did get,
               What they have hardly claw'd off yet.
               Januarys Tenth day, on my word,
               We got all into Legorne Road.
               For Prodick we two days did Ride,
               With many Merchants Ships beside.
               When we had Prodick got, Italian Jack
               Did furnish us with what we lack.
               For they were quick to come Aboard,
               And Wine, Bread, Sassages afford.
               They nimble were, Wino, Wino,
               And so about the Ship they go.
               But when that they see Monēy fail,
               They presently will turn their tale:
               Crying, Wino Pa Truckar—
               Then we do find where that they are;
               They'l run about old Coat, old Breech,
               And this about the Ships their speech:
               Till of our Money, and our Cloaths,
               They bravely now have wip'd our Nose.
               
                  
This Month the twentieth, we made bold,
               To hale our Ship into the Mould,
               Where that Month, and most part oth' next,
               It was before we had her fixt:
               For we were forst to watch, I ween,
               For weather fair, for to Careen.
            
            The End of the First Part:
         
         
            
            
            The second Part.
            
               The second Part of my Journal can,
               Sir, do no less, than kiss your Hand;
               I must begin from Legorne Mould,
               The other part hath so far told.
            
            
               SAint David, and her Second's clean,
               And ready to go out again;
               But Wind, and Weather, wont present,
               Which something hinders our intent.
               Mean while we to the Boom-boats run,
               Make all the haste that ere we can:
               To set our Money flying we,
               Did make such shifts as you ne're see.
               Tobacco we Ashoar did carry,
               In wine Casks, we were very wary.
               You might have seen oft-times our men,
               Go into Boom-boats, Eight, Nine, Ten,
               All on a row, with Coats on back,
               
                  
When they came out, some they did lack.
               Not only Coats, but also VVits,
               It brought some of them to strange Fits,
               Of Drunkenness, for you might see,
               In some Boats Drunk, above thrice three:
               That lost both Money had and wits,
               In these outragious Drunken fits.
               I moared one time was ashoar,
               At new Venus three days and more:
               Italian house it was, yet he,
               Our Kings Arms keeps, as you may see:
               VVith Sign, and Signpost, all compleat,
               All things in's House was very neat:
               It was 'bout midst of February,
               VVhen we got out most fine and bravely.
               The Dartmouth she got into the Road,
               Some days before us on my word.
               Some at Legorne they turned sick
               Because clapt with french fagot stick,
               Their greatest paine lay in their P—
               About their legs perhaps youd see
               A red rag placed most finely,
               To blind the world yet I have seen:
               Tho se jugling tricks what they have been
               This all makes for the Doctors gains
               He with these men will not take pains
               Except a bill under their hand
               He hath some money to command,
               In private to his Cabin door,
               They come and curse that pocky whore,
               
                  
And vow that they'l do so no more:
               They sower faces make and Cringe
               As you may see through the door hinge.
               Good Doctor oh I would not have,
               You give me more of that green salve
               It doth me torment very sore
               Therefore I pray give me no more
               A heavy curse on that same whore:
               The pleasure it few minutes lasteth
               But see the Body, how it wasteth:
               It makes them look both pale and wann
               Like Death, Oh thou unhappy man!
               That couldst not Anchor in cleer ground
               And company with them, are sound;
               You need not then a feared this wound.
               The first of March that very year
               We from Legorne away did steere
               With Dartmouth and the Tunnaseene
               We sayl'd away being brave and cleane
               This Tunnaseene to Tunis we convoy'd
               Cause of the Argeir Turks she was afraid
               Where we arrived the fifteenth day
               And Anchor dropped in the Bay;
               With hammocks down and all things cleer
               Being thirteen sayl of French-men there:
               There was the French Vice Admirall,
               With other ships being stout and tall
               We past them by, being very mute,
               We would not first the French salute
               Though they were Vice, and we but Rere,
               
                  
To first salute, we scorne I swear
               By English men that were 'ith Fleet,
               We heard the French did fret at it.
               One mad braind French Commander he,
               Swore he would come on board of we
               Cause their Vice Admiral we wont honour,
               Hed strick he swore our English Banner
               But they were very much mistaken
               Before that we by them were taken
               Or strike our gallant English Banner
               We'd fight most bravely for our Honour
               We would not flinch from them one jott
               He that gets honour looseth not
               If that he loose his life what then
               Eternal Fame gives the Anthem
               Of everlasting brave renown.
               When he is fallen into a sound.
               But the poor little Tunnaseene
               When she the French-men, once had seen
               She unto Porta fa re no
               With all her speed away did goe,
               Where she by two Frenchmen was taken,
               When she our company had forsaken,
               But Sir John's presence in that place:
               Did hinder them at that same space,
               Of making of her then a Prize:
               The French Vice Admirall was more wise
               For we by the Frenchmens side would sink
               Before that same should be I think▪
               The losse of this same Tunnaseene
               
                  
The English Counsels would a been
               Presents therefore he brought unto
               Sir John, who kindness him did show.
               In English Prize that sold was here
               Was took by Pirats of Argeir.
               One English Lady and her Maid
               Who that same time were sore afraid
               Least that bad usage they should have
               Because that then they were their slave
               But the English Consull did them buy
               And took them from their Custody
               With Honour then he did them treat
               And let them want nothing was fit
               This Lady was to Venice bound,
               Before the Turks they had her found:
               Her Unkle Consull of that place
               Sent a great Ransome for his Neece;
               And to Legorne we then convoy'd
               Both Lady ai, and eke her Maid.
               From Tunn is we did sayl away
               March the two and twentieth day
               And towards Messena we did sayl
               With good wind and a fresh gale
               Unto Messena we I say
               Did come the five and twentieth day:
               Some Merchants ships we then there found
               Which down the Straights with us were bound▪
               Sir John he did appoint the Fleet
               Him at Messena for to meet.
               Three weeks we here at least did stay
               
                  
A market was on board each day
               Except on Sundays then Sir John
               Would cause them all for to begone
               All sort of trade they brought aboard
               Silk Stockings Brande Wine they afford,
               Some Cabidges, some Nuts, some Figgs;
               Some Seracusa Wine, some Eggs,
               When Moneys gone, they'l truck for bread
               No more needs now for to be said
               Old a Drawers, old a Wascoate,
               And so about the Ship they trot.
               Nay some theyl truck even for old shooes
               There's naught so bad as theyl refuse
               Aprill the eight day we had newes
               How that the Seafare did refuse
               To fight four Argeir men of Warr
               Therefore they had her run a shore
               When Sir John heard this newes in hast
               We went to Sea thinking to bast
               With onely Dartmouth, them same four
               We prayd to meet with them each hour
               But who these bad things now can mend
               The wind it would not stand our friend
               But as we came then through the Vare,
               Anchor and Cable we lost there:
               By cross graind currant forst to Anchor
               We cut our stopper and shank painter
               Back to Messena we came then
               And found store of the Seafares men
               They lusty tall men were and stout▪
               
                  
Enough these four Sail for to rout;
               But their Commanders had no hearts,
               Like stout Men, for to act their parts:
               Old man he was by course of nature,
               His life it could not indure much longer:
               Twas great Renown for to be slain,
               Rather then such dishonour gain:
               And yet by hand of justice he
               Will loose his life assuredly,
               If ever upon English ground
               His foot he set, and to be found.
               April the twelfth, we Sail'd from,
               Messena, where we staid so long;
               VVith sixteen Sail of Merchantmen,
               VVe towards Legorne sailed then.
               That burning Island, Strambello,
               VVe sailed by that Night also;
               The blazing Flames, and sulpherous Fire,
               We saw, which some did much admire.
               The reason of it none can tell,
               But God above who knows full well.
               Upon our brave Saint Georges Day,
               VVe gain'd Legorn Port, I say:
               Much Powder that same day we Fire,
               But all in Love, none out of Ire.
               Two of our Squadron here we found,
               The Jersev, and Centurion:
               VVho to Careene did make  
                  old,
               To hale their Ships into the Mo:
               The Orenge Fire-ship, was there 
               
               
                  
VVho down the Straights did with us go:
               Likewise 'bove thirty Merchantmen,
               VVho down the Straights saild with us then:
               So that we had them in our Fleet,
               'Bove fifty Sail, both small and great;
               Like brood of Chickens, they close clings,
               Under the shelter of our wings.
               In our Main-top, we bore the Light,
               The Darmouth in the Rear all night,
               The Orenge carried the Dark light.
               VVith this brave Fleet, and gallant Gale,
               The fourth of May, we did set Sail;
               From Legoru Port, and left it standing,
               Where we did find it at our Landing.
               One Major Keene, aboard us came,
               And to Sir John did say the same;
               If that your Honour think it meet,
               I'de gladly be one of your Fleet:
               'Cause of those Pirats of Argeir,
               Sir, I do stand in mighty fear.
               Sir John him took for one of the Fleet,
               Then he the Master straight did greet;
               For Sailing-Orders, which I wrote,
               In Spanish Tongue, though in mean sort.
               Betwixt Legorne, and Alicant,
               One Night fair Wind we did not want:
               But this poor little Major Keene,
               As Merchants Ships, he came between.
               They for a Turk did him Éspie,
               And there great Guns at him let Fly;
               
                  
He straight then from them boar away,
               Under our Starn, fore it was day
               He was, and came Aboard Sir John,
               For to acquaint him of his wrong:
               Some of his Shrouds was shot, thats all,
               The harm they did him was but small.
               Poor man, be sure he ever after,
               Would always keep under our Quarter:
               Likewise▪ that night one Merchant-man,
               Stemling aboard of another ran;
               For help, he Fired then apace,
               Our Topsail to the Mast we brace;
               Got out our Boats, made all things cleer,
               Turks Men of War, we thought was there:
               Like Lyon robbed of his Prey,
               Sir John did hunt about I say,
               And every minute pray'd for day.
               To Alicant, in month of May,
               We came upon the Fifteenth day;
               With all our Merchants Ships beside,
               Till next day only, there we Ride.
               On Sixteenth day we way'd and go,
               With all Sails full for Malthago:
               All Turkish Pirats in Argeire,
               With our brave Fleet we did not fear.
               The One and Twentieth day of May,
               We came to Malthago by day:
               Malthago-Sack, for night we got,
               For Prodick here, we staied not:
               Upon next day we loose our Sails▪
               
                  
And bend our course next towards Cales.
               Towards the Straights mouth, then we did Sail
               But then we found Westerly Gale:
               The five and twentieth day therefore,
               VVe forced were for Giblesore.
               Into the Bay here with our Yeaul,
               VVe went a Fishing with a Traule.
               Some Gentlemen for to see Sport,
               Ashoar they did with us Resort:
               One Spanish Don came bravely Mounted,
               For man worth Thousands, I him counted;
               He rode close to us within reach,
               Askt us what Luck we had of Fish:
               Plucks Hat from Head, of Captain Stout,
               Puts Spurs to Horse, and wheels about:
               Away he Rides, like valiant Knight,
               That had Achieved some great Fight.
               VVho'd think a Person of such Feature,
               Should be of such base pilfering Nature.
               VVhen I do think of this Disaster,
               I think upon Lazarelloes Master;
               VVho Cloathes wore like some great D,
               But Money never he had none.
               May Twentieth, we loose our Sails,
               Once more we bend our course towards Cales:
               The VVind it prov'd a strong Levant,
               VVhich was the VVind that we did want.
               Next day we got to Cales therefore,
               The thundring Canons they did Roar;
               Birth day it was of Charles our King,
               
                  
VVhole Peals of Cancns we made Ring.
               Each Merchants Ship; also did Fire,
               VVhat Guns they had, from small to greater:
               For they had cause for to rejoyce,
               As well as we, with Heart and Voice.
               Cause he doth Seamen bravely Pay,
               That Guards their Ships, both night and day.
               Our Davids Sister, whom we call
               St Putrick, here Vice-Admiral,
               Of Fleet of Hollanders did Ride,
               VVith several Men of VVar beside.
               Here we three whole weeks here did lagg▪
               A waiting for Sir Edward Spragge;
               These Merchant Ships from us to take,
               And guard beyond the Southward Cape:
               The Merchants cause he stay'd so long,
               Came to Sir John with Reasons strong.
               And him perswaded to Convey
               Them England too, without delay.
               We watered then, made all things fit,
               Unto Old England for to get:
               Then Boot-hose-tops we gave Saint David,
               And on the Yards did shout and brave it:
               To think upon our English Girls,
               We joyful was as any Earls.
               But all our Joys were quite diminisht,
               Before our work we had quite finisht:
               For we saw the Vice-Admiral,
               Come with his Squadron, great and small.
               Our Mirth to Sorrow, all was turn'd,
               
                  
Our hearts within our Bosoms burn'd:
               To our acquaintance there Aboard,
               We could not one good word afford.
               For Enemies we did them take,
               And to them one good word wont speak:
               For they away our Fleet convay'd,
               With sorrow left us ill apaid:
               And likewise so was each Ships Master,
               Most sorrowful at this disaster:
               For they such love had for Sir John,
               The like they never had for none.
            
            
               This for the Second will suffice,
               Perhaps you'l think in it there's Lies;
               But Ile assure you it is true,
               To each man Ile give but his due.
            
            The End of the second Part.
         
         
            
            The third Part.
            
               The third Part now so far reach,
               As to Messena at one stretch;
               And if your Patience ben't out-worn,
               Perhaps will reach back to Legorn.
            
            
               ABout this time, in this same Road,
               We heav'd our Purser over-board;
               It seems his body was no stronger,
               He died cause he could live no longer.
               Enough of this, let's turn our Tale,
               When from Cates Road then did we Sail;
               Upon the sixteenth day of June,
               VVe Sail'd away before twas Noon;
               Towards Tangeire, Orders to take,
               To make the Moors of Salle quake,
               Lord Howard there, as I do tell yea,
               No peace would make with' Moors of Salle.
               
                  
That very June the nineteenth day,
               VVe Anchor did in Tangeire Bay.
               Sir John was sick, and therefore,
               Could not my Lord wait on ashoar;
               Therefore my Lord, he did afford,
               To see Sir John, to come Aboard.
               Upon our Main-topgallant-mast-head,
               A young-man did a Jack-Flag spread:
               At each Yard Arm, our Pendants blow,
               Methoughts they made a goodly show:
               He Noble was to them oth' side.
               And to the Centuries beside.
               After his Treatment with Sir John,
               We quickly guest the Conclusion.
               Powder we took in thirty Barrels,
               To vindicate Lord Howards Quarrels:
               To fight a Castle hard by Salle Bar,
               Cause we against them had got VVar.
               The four and twentied day of June,
               Our Anchors up we did get soon.
               The Dartmouth, and Norfolk, with us Sail,
               With pretty fresh Easterly Gale.
               When we unto this Salle did draw nigh,
               Two Sail of Hollanders, we did espie:
               With Salle men of War, which they had took,
               Another put Ashoar, which Moors forsook.
               That day, the twenty eighth of June,
               We saw that raging Bar in Afternoon;
               Likewise the Fort, which to the Southward-stood,
               It very near was unto the Bars foot.
               
                  
Though Sir John's known of Courage bold,
               
                  nd by no Enemi will be controul'd▪
               
                  f four Ships unto one appear,
               He doth not stand at all in fear;
               But for to fight against this place,
               Wherefor to ack, there is room scarce:
               
                  n Ships so great of Charge as ours,
               Twere in the Air, for to build Towers.
               
                  or if a Ship should miss to stay,
               
                  shoare she soon might be, I say:
               Therefore we Cruset about the Bar,
               
                  o meet with Salle men of War;
               
                  nt meeting none, we Sail'd away,
               
                  o boot 'twas for us, there to stay:
               
                  nd towards Tangeir, away we Sail,
               
                  ith pretty handsome South-west Gale.
               
                  uly the Fourth, we there Arived,
               
                  nd found it standing where we left it:
               
                  gain that very night we waighed,
               
                  ut by my Lord, again was staied;
               
                  ecause he did intend to go,
               
                  o Cales with us, next day also.
               
                  eparations therefore we did make,
               
                  ip-board, my Lord, next day to take:
               
                  e got up Flag-staff, all things meet,
               
                  ith honour now, my Lord to Treat;
               
                  ut minds of Great men, oft do change,
               
                   thing it is, more true than strange:
               
                   Lord he then, not being ready,
               
                   Cales Road we steered steaddy.
               
                  
At three a Clock, he sixth of July,
               From Tangeir, we did Sail most duly:
               And at Eleven that same day,
               We gained Cales-Road, I do say.
            
            
               Five Merchant-men there of good force,
               We found, which staied there for us:
               For they up to the Straights were bound,
               And did salute us, each one round.
               We watered then, made all things fit,
               VVhat things we wanted, we did get:
               And on July, the fifteenth day,
               From Cales-Road we did part away:
               But in the Bay of Bulls next day,
               VVe dropped Anchor and did stay:
               Because a Fleet of Merchant-Men▪
               VVe did espie, a coming then▪
            
            
               The Convoy of that Fleet was then,
               The Jearsey, and Centurian;
               Two of our Squadron, these Ships was,
               The matter it was ordered thus.
               As we go up, then they come down,
               And so our Convoys, they go round:
               No better way was ever taken,
               Nor will be when the same's forsaken.
               The sixteenth day, away we Sail,
               VVith pretty fresh, and merry Gale:
               VVith Fire-ship, we eight Sail are,
               The Argereens, we do not fear:
               But in Straights-mouth, good wind we want,
               For we did find a strong Levant.
               
                  
We tare our Rigging, split our Sails,
               Levant strong blows, there's naught avails:
               We Anchored then, and broke our Cable,
               Under Cape Sprat, there nothing able,
               To do good 'gainst this Wind, as yet,
               Before its Venome it hath spit.
               The Twenty First, got Anchor hold,
               Under the Cape, before is told.
               New Sails brought too, and Rigging mended,
               Before next day, it was half ended.
               The Two and Twentieth, we did waigh,
               And then got into Tangeir Bay,
               Where we Sir Thomas Allen saw,
               But Current won't, lets near him draw:
               With several Frigots which did Ride,
               In Tangeir Bay, with him beside.
               VVe him saluted, though I'me sure,
               VVe were a League from him, and more.
               Two Pinks, one Ketch, he sent to us,
               For to convoy them up the Straights:
               The Ketch she had Commanders in,
               For the Advice, and Garnsey, which were slain;
               For they did die both in the Bed of Honour,
               In the Defence of our brave Banner:
               With seven Sail of best Ships of Argeir,
               They bravely fought, & stood no whit in fear▪
               And did secure some Merchant-men,
               In company were with them then.
            
            
               July the Twenty Sixth, we stood,
               That day unto Malhago Road:
               
                  
By reason fair wind we had got,
               At that same time we Anchored not;
               But there our Boat she went ashoar.
               And Sack she brought Aboard good store:
               That night there was some drunk, some sober,
               And some were also half Seas over:
               Some men would Prate beyond their skill,
               When of this Sack, they'd got their fill.
               And when you tell them on't next day,
               They do not know then what you say.
               Nay, that same time, if but a Swabber,
               He'l swear, he'l Rig a Ship all over.
            
            
               The fourth of Augustnext, I say,
               We got to Almarea Bay:
               Because we then fair wind did want,
               But on the sixth, got Alieant:
               Where we did get Wine special good,
               Called by Englishmen, Ox-blood.
               Like Blood it is, for it doth cherish,
               Both Heart and Body, and us nourish.
               That very Night, we weigh'd again,
               And sailed back towards Catergean;
               To fetch one Merchant-man oth' Fleet,
               Whom we had promised to meet.
               There off the Cape, for we did fear,
               Else she might meet Ships of Algeir;
               And so she had, for we did see,
               Under the Cape, there two to be:
               When they saw us, straight Sail they make,
               They had no mind with us to speak:
               
                  
Could we but S as well as they,
               We their Arears would quickly pay:
               But when we chase those Whores-birds they▪
               Like Lightning from us run away:
               They'r single Ships built all for Sayling,
               Likewise they always are them cleaning.
               Enough of them, we hoyse a taunt,
               Our Sails, and steer for Alicant:
               To take those Ships with as Aloft,
               When they had livered Goods they brought▪
               On tenth of August, we did get,
               To Alicant, but they as yet,
               Are not quite fixt; therefore we stay,
               Till that same August, the twelfth day.
               Where we this blood of Bulls did drink,
               Till some could hardly stand, I think.
               'Tis sweet, Delicious, very tempting,
               The Bottle is not long a emptying:
               When that is out, we'l fill another,
               When that is gone, we must have tother.
               By this same time, then we are in,
               To drink apace, we do begin;
               Some Healths to this friend, some to that,
               Some swears you drink't not off, there's a cha
               
               What with smoaking, drinking, there's a pother
               That by and by, we do not know each other:
               Fight then and quarrel with our dearest friend,
               For sober men to speak, is to no end:
               For nothing then is heard but ribble rabble,
               ▪Mongst drunken men, for there's such a babble
               
                  
You scarce can hear your own self speak,
               For Mad-men then, you would them take.
            
            
               If you the Reason now of this would know,
               I straight unto you will it show:
               To short Allowance, always goes poor men,
               When they get drink that's good, tis great feast then;
               Their Beef, and Pork, is very scant,
               I'me sure of weight, one half it want:
               A kind of Horse-beans, they do get for Pease,
               No nourishment at all there is in these:
               Instead of English Cheese, and Butter,
               A little Oyl we get, God wot, far worser.
            
            
               A little Rice we get instead of Fish,
               Which to you well is known, but a poor Dish:
               Except good Spice to put in it, you had,
               For with good Sauce, a Deal-board is not bad;
               Our Drink, it is but Vinigar and water,
               Four-shilling beer in England's ten times better
               So that when Saylors gets good Wine,
               They think themselves in Heaven for th'time:
               It Hunger cold, all Maladies expels,
               With cares oth'world, we trouble not our selves
            
            
               I know the King far better doth allow,
               But how to compass it, we do not know:
               For Mutaneers, we will be never,
               If that we keep but Life and Soul together.
               Commanders few there are, wch thinks on this,
               When they have daily each thing wch they wi
               
               We seldom these same Festivals do use,
               Which is the reason we do it abuse.
               
                  
Our Dream by this time, now is out,
               The Boatswain winds his Call, now look about,
               Hark, hark, up Anchor, turn out before,
               Get Bars in Capstan, let's our Ship unmoar:
               The Gun is fired, Light in Top-mast shrouds,
               Aloft is mounted, though not near the Clouds.
               The foresaid day, at ten a Clock at night,
               A Storn we did leave Aticant then quite:
               Porta Mahone, the plae we next intend,
               Therefore for it, we strait our course do bend;
               A place it is, where English Hulk do lie,
               Which now our Ships of War, they careen by.
               Good Harbour this same is upon Miork,
               For Shiping very useful 'gainst the Turk:
               The King of Spain, doth to our King it lend,
               As in the Line before, for that same end:
               The entrance into this same place, is not wide,
               Not 'bove a Pistol shot, from side to side:
               Likewise a Castle of great force there stands,
               Which Ships as they, go in and out commands.
               The Spaniard they, are jealous of our Fleet,
               No more than seven a time, he will admit:
               For to come in, lest thas we should him wrong,
               Of that same place, which he has had so long.
            
            
               The Sixteenth of this August, we
               Great storm of VVind had got at Sea;
               Flashes of Lightning, claps of Thunder,
               Which made our men most greatly wonder.
               Our Mainsail, and our Mizen, it did split,
               Our Foresail we did lower, and furl it:
               
                  
Near to the Islands we were then,
               Which made us play our parts like men▪
               'Tis ne're the near to cry, God help,
               And nothing do to save our self.
               Mainsail and Mizen, we brought too,
               Our Fore-yard we hoysed also:
               In space of three quarters of an hour,
               It Rain'd as fast as it could pou'r.
               Porta Mahone, without delay,
               We gain'd on Augusts eighteenth day;
               Where we alone did enter in,
               The rest oth' Fleet not suffered then,
               Because that we seven Sail did make,
               No more into their Hive they'l take.
            
            
               All sorts of Stores we here request,
               We got yet something of the least:
               We got one Anchor, and one Cable,
               To ride our Ship were very able.
               Bread, Wine, Hens, Eggs, all things were cheap,
               One piece of Eight, would buy a Sheep.
               A Hauser on each side ashoar,
               On that same fashion here you moar.
               Good Harbour this same is, when in,
               No wind can harm you there one pin.
               The twentieth day we weigh'd again,
               And sailed towards Legorn amain:
               The Summer Island Merchant we,
               Did take into our Company:
               Also one Fly-boat twice Retaken,
               By Us, and Turks, and was forsaken;
               
                  
Unto Marcellus, her we would convey,
               But she was lost Ashoar, then by the way:
               For tid of the Dartmouth's light, she steer'd by,
               A light which on the Shoar was nigh;
               And thus this same poor Fly-boat, then they lost
               Being before by much misfortune crost:
               She Pitcht so well ashoar, as God would have it
               That every Man and Boy, in her was saved.
            
            
               September the fourth day, at Sea,
               Came out my Ban Yean Saturday:
               Invective 'twas against Purser, and his Crew,
               Because to Saylors, they won't give their due:
               And now the same unto you I'le rehearse,
               For thus I fram'd it to Sir John, in Verse.
            
            
               'Tis for no harm I fall a Rhiming,
               My thinks the Bells are now a Chiming:
               Purser, Steward, Mate, all three,
               I wish them hang'd upon a Tree:
               Except that we have Scoffe for Dinner,
               It were no harm as I'me a sinner.
            
            
               They say they give us what the King allows,
               They think they speak to fools, that nothing knows:
               But they'r mistaken ith' matter quite,
               Were we their Judg, they'd hang outright:
               But seeing 'tis as 'tis, we cannot mend it,
               That last it should 6 months more, God defend it
               The Voyage too long already hath been runing
               They'd have it last as long again, they'r cuning
               They have gilt to buy, what things they want,
               One penny 'mongst the Foremast-men is scant
               
                  
Though we belong unto the David, Saint,
               For want of Victuals, we are nowgrown faint.
            
            
               Our Beef, and Pork, is very scant,
               I'me sure of weight, one half it want:
               Our Bread is black, and Maggets in it crawl,
               That's all the fresh Meat, we are fed withal;
               When we these things to Sir J. Harman say,
               Our Purser mends the matter for a day:
               Thinking to make us weary of complaining,
               But he upon our Bellies still is gaining.
               Old Taylor, he both Calls and Bawls,
               Dispatch, make haste, Aloft hammawls.
               He is in haste, as if the Spits were turning,
               Nay, in such haste, as if the Meat were burning:
               But when the work is done, as I'me a sinner,
               Foremast-men havenaught but bread for diner
               When we are sick, our Doctors Mate, poor soul▪
               Doth ask us, when that we were last at stool;
               If three or four days pass, that were defective,
               He tells us that our Body's very costive.
               And straight to us a Glisterpipe applys,
               Put's Plug in Vent, and then away let flies;
               Also some drams of Blood from us he'l take,
               The Purser this Phistian work doth make:
               Had men their victuals due, they'd go to stool,
               Without his rare contrived Glister Tool.
               Six Months short lowance now is due, & more,
               We houe Sir John will think upon the poor:
               That we his health may pray for at Legorn,
               The prayers of poor men, are not quite forlorn
               
                  
For this we understand by Scripture Book,
               God on the prayers of poor, as rich doth look.
               Now to conclude this simple Rhim,
               Methings that it is quite high time.
               Heavens bless Sir John, and all that's his▪
               I'me sure, I do not pray amiss.
               As for the Purser, and his Crew,
               For this time I'le bid them adue;
               Assuring them if matters are not mended,
               More they shall have before the Voyage be ended.
               Written on Ban Yean Saturday, 
               being Kettle Holy-day.
               We got upon September's seventh day,
               Unto Legorn, and Anchored there, I say▪
               Where our good Victualer came Aboard,
               And gave to us a parcel of fair words.
               But stinking Beef, he sent to us to eat,
               So that we count his fair words but a Cheat.
               Some Bacon that was good he sent likewise,
               But that was only for to blind our eyes:
               For when we were from Legorn Road,
               The Bacon was quite done, upon my word.
            
            
               Upwards of Twenty days, we here did ride,
               With men of war, and Merchants Ships beside:
               A waiting for the Lewis, and the Mary;
               But they came not, the wind did hang contrary
               At that same place, Italian Shoes and Hose,
               On board us came, which kept warm our toes:
               
                  
A Cable New▪ here we did get,
               Likewise some Hausers small and great:
               We fore and main, and top-sail sheets got new,
               With good maintacks, all fit for winters heu:
               Our Sails we banded, and got new fore-topsail,
               Likewise of Hollands Duck, we got a Mainsail.
            
            
               The boom-boat men▪ had little trading now,
               For money to procure, men knew not how.
               But with some men, the old trade it proceeded,
               For some would sell their clothes, though clothes they needed.
            
            
               October then the seventh day,
               We from Legorn, did part away;
               But cause that one Ship came not out,
               We Anchored there the other bout.
               But on the Eighth, we weigh'd again,
               And bent our course towards Naples then:
               Bacon and Beveride Wine to get,
               'Cause at Legorn we had not it.
               The wind being bad, back then we stood,
               And Anchored then in Legorn Road:
               On the tenth day, we weigh'd again.
               And towards Naples sail amain,
               
                  ut still the Wind it was cross grain'd.
               For on the Eleventh, on my word,
               We came once more for Legorn Road.
            
            
               On thirteenth day, we weigh and go,
               Betwixt the Main, and Isle Lilbow:
               Our Coon here over-board we,
               Did heave, being stormy wind at Sea.
               
                  
To Naples that same famous City,
               We got the sixteenth day compleatly;
               On seventeenth we Prodick get,
               'Twas the best place we came to yet.
               This place with plenty it is stored,
               Boom-boats on board, when we were moared:
               All things they brought, what you could name,
               And very cheap they sold the same:
               Here each man did a Dollar get,
               But we did buy no Lands with it;
               Old trade it did proceed a pace,
               Some were half drunk for three days space:
               The Wine was cheap, and very good,
               It chear'd our hearts, and warm'd our blood:
               A quarter of a Sheep a shilling,
               You might buy for, if you are willing.
               The same October, five and twentieth day,
               From this place we did Sail away:
               Towards Messena, then we Sail,
               With pretty fresh Westerly Gale.
               On twenty sixth, a Boom-boat came,
               Six Leagues to Sea to us, George by name:
               So eager they at this place, to get gains,
               That they don't stick for to take pains,
               On this Months one and thirtieth day,
               Unto Messena we did get, I say:
               But two days here, this time we stay,
               But straight for Zant, we Sail away:
               Three Merchant Ships with us did Sail,
               And got we had westerly Gale.
               
                  
The Dartmouth having sprung a Leak,
               Here we did leave her, it to seek;
               With Orange Fire-ship to Careen,
               One by the other, and make clean:
               And we did get to Zant, I say,
               Upon November, the sixth day.
            
            
               The third Part now, I quite have done,
               For to the highest we are run:
               For every day, we Home-wards do,
               Unto Old England bravely go;
               And in our Prayers, fair Wind we crave,
               That we may now short Passage have.
            
            The End of the third Part.
         
         
            
            The fourth Part.
            
               WE stopt at Zant, but four days space,
               Back to Messena we did Sail apace:
               No Ship was with us, we alone did Sail,
               Towards Messena, with brave Levant-Gale:
               Which we in three days gain alone,
               Being from Messena ten days gone.
               The Dartmouth, and the Orange can't,
               Believe that we ave been at Zant;
               In so short space indeed the Wind,
               Going and coming, stood our Friend.
               But stay, one thing I told yee not,
               I had it almost quite forgot:
               One night as we Sail'd with fresh breeze,
               Came up with us a Tiolie:
               Although that one Ship we don't fear,
               Our upper Guns we did make clear;
               Our Pinnace we hoist over-board▪
               Into the Sea, upon my word;
               In morning soon as it was day,
               Turks Flag at Topmast-head, I say:
               
                  
We did espie as he came near us,
               Because we peace had with them, he don't fear us:
               A little Tool she was, but full of men,
               As whors-birds, one by other could stand then.
               To windward they at least, two streaks did hele her
               As they came sailing under our Quarter:
               One English Runnegado came on board,
               Likewise one Hollander, upon my word:
               They told us they were twice aboard us coming,
               As they under our Quarter, then were runing:
               They beg'd a Compass, told us Lies,
               Enough of them, this will suffice.
            
            
               November the twelfth day alone,
               We tied Saint David to a Stone;
               At Messena, one Fortnight there,
               Because we wanted wind was fair,
               No soul alive did ever see,
               Such Traffique as on board had we,
               All sorts▪ of things they put to Sale,
               Except it were strong Beer and Ale:
               Silk-stockings, Carpets, Brande-wine,
               Silk Neckcloaths, also very fine:
               Cabidges, Carrets, Turnips, Nuts,
               The last a man may eat from Sluts:
               Lemmons, Orenges, and good Figs,
               Seracusa Wine also, and Eggs.
               If you no Money had then they'd Truckar,
               For Brande-wine out of their Jar:
               For Coats that's torn, and very old,
               They Wine or Brande, then give would.
               
                  
Strange 'twas to see such filthy Raggs,
               As they would put into their Baggs:
               With Brande, Brande, Brande Wino,
               About they march most brave and Fino:
               On twenty seventh of November,
               We forlorn left them, I remember,
               With Dartmouth, and the Orange we,
               That very day did put to Sea.
               In one weeks time, though stormy weather,
               We gained Legorn Port, together.
            
            
               Upon December, the fourth day,
               'Twas when we Anchored there, I say,
               Where Frigots two, and Merchant-men,
               We at an Anchor did find then:
               The Jearsey, and the Garnsey, they,
               Were the two Men of War, I say;
               The Lewis, and the Mary too,
               With other Ships, a lusty Crew:
               Some were bound up for the Levant,
               But a fair wind that time they want:
               The Mary and the Lewis down,
               Who very glad were we them found:
               Thursday the eighth day, we did see,
               A Fleet of Ships appear from Sea:
               They Newfound-land men were then all,
               The Swallow, she was Admiral:
               The Kent, she was the other Convoy,
               They brought their Fleet along most bravely:
               They to Legorn, brought store of Fish,
               Which 'mongst Italians is good Dish.
               
                  
They Prodick did them straight afford,
               By reason of their Fish aboard;
               Of our Comrades we did get Fish,
               Which we do look on as brave Dish:
               For Breakfast Meat, with little Oyl,
               This same poor Jack we fry and broyl:
               'Twas salt, and relisht well our Liquour,
               I know no Breakfast meat more fitter.
               The Goods here of my Lord Ambassador,
               We now took in, cause of the War.
               Likewise three Englishwomen hence we carry▪
               To England, cause no longer here they'l tarry▪
               But I must needs confess to you,
               The reason of their Travels, I don't know:
               Perhaps 'twas to convert the Pope,
               For of that Sex, the best I hope.
               I forth the womb of woman came,
               Therefore that Sex I will not blame:
               The one is Motherly and staid,
               The other saileth for a Maid;
               But Mistriss Sarah still shall be,
               The handsomest of all the three;
               And shall within my Journal stand,
               A Beauty powerful to command.
            
            
               Part of Sir John, his Cabin they,
               Have to command on Board alway:
               For they unto the Vulgar sort,
               At no time will make their resort:
               But commonly do closly keep,
               Within their Cabin, where they sleep.
               
                  
Unless sometimes to take the Air,
               They do resort in weather fair;
               Upon the Quarter-deck, so high,
               The wonders of the Seas to spie:
               Also to Prayers, they seldom miss,
               They are Religious sure by this.
               Some men of Passion, more than wit,
               Will blame these Gentle-women yet:
               Gadders they'l say they are abroad,
               And will not them good word afford.
            
            
               To this Objection now I say,
               Times and Occasions, serve they may;
               For women for to pass the Seas,
               Their Minds and Fancies, for to please;
               For they the same flesh are, and blood,
               As men are made of, and as good:
               And as good reason have they may,
               To cross the Seas, as some of they;
               I see naught by them, but what's civil,
               Therefore by them I'le speak no evil.
            
            
               This for the womens sake, was Pen'd,
               Not them desertless to commend:
               But 'cause the World shall see that I,
               A womans Friend will live, and die.
               Not as some Vulgars, by conjectures,
               Those in the least are not Protectors;
               Of Ladies Chastities, for they,
               More than is truth, oft-times will sa;
               Of me, I pray, those things do'nt n use;
               But those foregoing Lines peruse.
               
                  
I hope the words that I heard last,
               On Quarrer-deck, some few days past:
               Will also prove from them most true,
               Whom I most kindly bid adue.
            
            
               Enough now of these Female Creatures,
               Of their Behaviours, and their Features.
               Let's now some other things peruse,
               I'le straight ways tell you all the News:
               The Jearsey told to us therefore,
               That She and four good Frigots more,
               Six Sail of Turks had put a shoar:
               Under Cape Sprat, as in their stations,
               They watching lay, the Turks ships motions.
            
            
               Some Hollanders from Sea them chase,
               To the Straights mouth they high apace:
               Whereas I told yea once before,
               The Jearsey, and four Sail lay more:
               There was two Ships there of our Squadron,
               Called the Jearsey, and Centurian;
               The Hampshire, and the Portmouth she,
               Likewise the Foresight did them see:
               All things then fitted and made clear,
               When they did to their sight appear.
            
            
               Per force they might to Leeward bear,
               Because the Dutch to Windward were▪
               Where our brave Frigots took them up,
               Being glad that night with them to Sup:
               Our Iron Dogs did at them Roar,
               Which made them stand in towards th'shoar.
               But we did tear them whole Planks out,
               Which put them Rogues all to the Rout.
               
                  
Our Captains Five, all plaid their parts,
               Like men of stout and valiant Hearts;
               They Tore them, you ne're saw the like,
               Being near the shoar they will not strike:
               At two a Clock fore day therefore,
               Their Ships to Rights, they ran Ashoar:
               Where fourscore Slaves, Christians we take,
               And Freemen of them we did make.
               Two of those Pirat men of War,
               Did force these Slaves to run ashoar:
               One English-man got to Tangeir,
               Which to Cape Sprat, is pretty near:
               And out of seventeen Hundred men,
               Said but seven Hundred, they did maser then:
               We sent our Boats, and burnt them all,
               As they ashoar lay, both great and small.
               The smallest had got Thirty Guns,
               And was at least Two Hundred Tuns:
               From Thirty unto Fifty they were Gun'd,
               But thanks be unto God, now they are burnd.
               And may those Pirats all come to such ends,
               Then theywould gladly be with us good friends
               They to Mahomet much did trust,
               They cut a Sheep in middle just;
               Hide, Head, Heart, Tail, and Horns, and all,
               And on Mahomet, they did call.
               With conjuring words, they on my word,
               Did on both sides throw over-board.
               In time of Fight, we them oppress,
               They help besought in their distress.
               
                  
But he asleep, I think was then,
               For he wont hearken to these men;
               Or else some business great, he had to do,
               No ear he gave to his heathen Crew.
               They which escaped with their Lives,
               Taffeleta made as bad as Slaves;
               Because Argeir took Guylands part,
               He vow'd for that, he'd make them smart;
               For he and Guyland, were great Foes,
               And oft-times had exchanged blows.
               It was August, the thirteenth day,
               When we did act this same, I say:
               Some few disasters like this same,
               These roguish Pirates would soon tame.
            
            
               These heathen Turks have been so bold,
               That seize on Kings Ships, these Rogues would;
               Witness the Speedwel, and the Faulcon,
               As they conveyed New-found-land men:
               Where Captain Hubbard life lost quite,
               Ethese Rogues, when he was in fight:
               Some Merchants Ships from us they took,
               When men their Ships had once forsook.
            
            
               Also in Ship, call'd Mary Rose,
               Brave Sir John Kempthorn they oppose,
               Though they were seven, he but one,
               With courage bold, yet he went on:
               And fought them bravely, made them run,
               Be ore that he with them had done.
            
            
               fTwo Captains they kill'd in a trice,
               In Ships call'd Garnsey, and Advice:
               
                  
They fought most bravely with seven Sail,
               To pay them off, they did not fail:
               
                  ptains died in Bed of Honour,
               In the defence of our brave Banner:
               The Turks Vice-Admiral did careen,
               The Gernsey, and Advice between:
               Cause of her Leaks, for they did hit her,
               At that same time, twixt wind and water:
               Had then the wind a little freshed,
               We at that time had her so threshed;
               That they at all need not to fear,
               Her ever going to Argeir.
               When they saw by them, they got nought,
               But still receiv'd good as they brought;
               They would no longer with them stay,
               
                  ut hoyst their Sails, and went away:
               
                   
                  ey to Sayling more do trust,
               Than to their Fighting, and needs must;
               Our great shot, they can't long abide,
               For they have Thin and Paper-side.
            
            
               So much of these same Argereens,
               Who next will treat of our own Friends;
               Who ready were with us to Sail,
               Before I told yea this last Tale.
               It was the Mary, and the Lewis,
               On Thursday fore that we eat Brewis;
               For on the Italians Christmas-day,
               We all from Legorn Sail'd away:
               Which fore our Christmas, is ten days,
               Accounted by them just always▪
               
                  
We Sail'd away with small Levant,
               Which we did three days after want:
               For then the Wind came to the West,
               Which well is known no of the best
               On nineteenth in the morning then,
               The VVind proved Levant again:
               Against the Western Seas we thunder,
               As if 'twould beat our Boughs asunder;
               This blew not Home, for at the best.
               The twentieth day it was Northwest.
            
            
               The two and three and twentieth day,
               Great storm of VVind we had at Sea:
               Our Mainsail forth the Boltrops blew,
               What I do tell you▪ is most true:
               Such storm this Voyage we never had,
               Indeed 'twas weather very sad.
               Two men were Duckt at Main-yard Arm,
               Being new Mainsail, yet no harm
               They go; that time as God would have it,
               But they got in again, and both were saved:
               Drank each a pint of wine, kept inside warm,
               By means whereof, the outside took no harm;
               On four and twentieth day we had,
               Brave weather, which made our hearts glad.
            
            
               The Orange, Lewis, and the Mary,
               Left us this time by VVinds contrary:
               But them we hope to meet again,
               At Sea, or Alicant in Spain:
               The Dartmouth she doth still stick by us,
               On our Lee-quarter she keeps nigh us.
               
                  
All weather that from Skie doth blow.
               She far from us doth never go:
               Also upon that stormy day,
               She had a man washt quite away:
               The VVind so feircely it did blow,
               That him to save, they could not go:
               Boat over-board for to hoyse then,
               Was way for them to loose more men.
            
            
               Our Christmas we do keep at Sea,
               Upon Decembers five and twentieth day,
               But cause that it did happen on a Sunday,
               Our Fidler plays on Saturday and Munday.
               Some give him Money, some good Wine,
               The Rogue doth tope his nose, till he is blind.
               Instead of Rost-beef, and Plum-pies,
               Good Houghs of Bacon, doth us now suffice.
               With Puddings mixt with Fruit and Oyl,
               
                  n surnace this same day we boyl:
               Our Gunners Pudding made so great,
               That twenty men could scarce it eat:
               With Swords and Pistols, forth the Cook-room
               They it convoy'd into the Gun-room:
               Silk Flag, they also did display,
               As they this Pudding fetcht away:
               Which 'mongst our men, caus'd great laughter
               The Ensign will be told on't after:
               As he doth in his VVherry row,
               There doth this Pudden Ensign-bearer go:
               Yet he the honour had to bear,
               A Flag before a Pudden rare.
               
                  
'Bout this time fell a sad mischance,
               Roger our Boar fell in a Trance;
               This Christmas-tide he died for hunger,
               For want of Meat, could live no longer.
            
            
               Methinks, could but this poor Boor speak,
               To this effect, he'd silence break.
            
            
               Oh brother Sumpter, you live high,
               You will not me poor Boar come nigh;
               I'me in distress, and want good Meat,
               You Delicates do dayly eat:
               Did you but feel the Hunger▪ I
               Do dayly feel, you soon would die.
               My Children I leave Fatherless,
               My Wife also in great Distress:
               You also wrong your self, my Body great,
               When I am dead you will not eat:
               Good Brawn I am, if but well fed,
               But good for naught if this time dead;
               For I am Thin, and very Lean,
               You always keep my Teeth so clean.
               O Brother, unkind for ever unto you,
               I do at this time, bid my last adue;
               But yet I pray, been't so unkind,
               To srve my Wife, I left behind.
               One Hair which on my back doth grow,
               For Coblars Ends, I won't bestow;
               To Brotherhood unkind like you,
               And so once more, Adue, adue.
               These were the last words, spoke poor Boar
               When this was said, he straight gave ore:
               
                  
And died; and then upon my word,
               We straightway heav'd him over-board.
            
            
               Decembers thirtieth day, with small Levant,
               We early Anchor dropt at Alicant:
               Where we to our great griefs did hear,
               The Orange, Mary, Lewis, came not there;
               Which we in stormy Gulph of Lyons lost,
               For a new search, we backwards now are forst:
               We that same very night did weigh again,
               To find them off the Cape, but all in vain:
               With pretty fresh Levant, we beat the Seas,
               But yet could hear no news, our minds to please
               But only by some Frigot we did hear,
               How that Sir Edward Spagge, had took Argeir:
               A Ship so called of that Town,
               The Turks they had her run on ground;
               But he did get her off again,
               And bravely brought her into Spain.
               The Christian Slaves seeing this disaster,
               Fall on the Turks, what they could master;
               They stopt from running then ashoar,
               And Slaves we made of them therefore:
               So they from Slaves, was made men free,
               And Turks from Freemen, Slaves to be:
               This was the first Voyage she did make,
               When that Sir Edward did her take:
               And may they all come to such fortune,
               'Twould better be for us, I'me certain.
            
            
               So much concerning this same Turk,
               Let's now return to our old work;
               
                  
Of looking out for our lost sheep,
               The Cape, and Islands round, we sweep:
               Miork, Minork, and Iversey,
               We seach about our lost to see:
               He that the Mary first can see,
               Two Dollars in his way 'twill be.
               We look out sharp, no news can hear,
               Pray God they are not in Argeir:
               But yet I think, they'd make good fight,
               'Tis not three Turks, would them affright.
            
            
               One six and thirty Guns doth carry,
               And she by name, is call'd the Mary:
               For two Turks Ships, she doth not care,
               At Mizen Top-mast Head most fair;
               Saint George's Flag, she bears withal,
               A three Deckt ship she is and tall:
               The Captain is of Courage bold,
               For Turks he will not be contrould;
               Captain Hunt he's call'd, good Ships he ever,
               Did sail forth of brave Londons River,
               The Lewis, she hath twenty four,
               A true Consort both day and hour,
               She'd do what lay within her power.
            
            
               In Orange Fire-ship, Captain Ball,
               Would execution do withal.
            
            
               So that they handsome Fight would make,
               Before the Turks they should them take:
               But that we fear now most of all,
               The Orange Fire-ship, Captain Ball;
               She was so Leaky and so old,
               
                  
That we doe fear she founder would,
               But God who knows each thing above,
               I hope that fear will soon remove.
            
            
               January, the fourth day from Sea,
               We did approach near Iversey:
               We Anchored, sent our Boat to hear,
               Whether or no they had been there;
               No news being there, we went o work,
               Heav'd up our Anchor for Miork:
               January the fifth day we got,
               Unto Miork, but found them not:
               The Dartmouth Pink, before call'd Ketch,
               We found her in our morning watch;
               One Merchant Ship there was beside,
               Which at an Anchor here did Ride.
            
            
               The Spaniards us no Prodick gave,
               Because so many Guns we'l have,
               As we gave him; but he'l have odds,
               He Vow'd, and Swore, by all his gods;
               That Governour, presumtuous Elf,
               May take a Knife and hang himself;
               Before that we'l him honour so,
               Therefore a way strait-ways we go;
               With Dartmouth in our company,
               That fifth day we did put to Sea:
               Unto the Eastward we did stretch,
               Once more our lost to find, we search:
               Three Sail of Ships, we then espied,
               As they unto the Westward plied:
               We strait-way thought, they were out lost,
               
                  
But by misfortune we were crost:
               For they were Frigots Kent and Swallow,
               The Lawson, Merchant-man, them follow;
               Without Main-top-mast, cause that she,
               Her Main-cap then, had spent at Sea:
               With pensive hearts, we turn again,
               And bend our Course, next for the Main:
               And four days after we did steer,
               Into the Bay called Alleer;
               With Dartmouth in our company,
               The Kent and Swallow, left at Sea:
               Who that same  
                  air wind did want,
               To gain that Port'd Alicant:
               Here we got Water store, and Wine,
               The Spaniards they were very kind:
               The ninth day we did get the Bay,
               And staied only till next day;
               Then weigh'd again, though wind but scant,
               On twelfth day we got Alicant.
            
            
               The Mary and the Lewis, here we found,
               Which made our joys at this time to abound▪
               No news of the poor Orange we,
               Can here since we her lost at Sea:
               We give her over quite for lost,
               The men all to be drown'd, that's worst.
            
            
               'Bout twenty Sail of small Craft we,
               Here found now bound with us to Sea:
               But first we Liquour'd well our Brains,
               Which made well for the Spaniards gains:
               VVe drank store of this blood of Bulls,
               
                  
And so we parted from these Culls.
               Upon the fourteenth we did weigh,
               With all our Fleet we put to Sea:
               Where we a small Levant had got,
               But long the same it lasted not;
               On fifteenth day to the Southwest,
               It came, which was none of the best.
               Some of our men Pooke Pudding got,
               And run with it in the Fore-top;
               They eat it all, 'tis very true,
               And gave the Bag unto the Sow:
               With as good will, they could I swear,
               Have eat him, had they had him there;
               Or else they would a broke his Neck,
               But he keeps on the Quarter-deck:
               And if the Top were there, I say,
               Perpaps he enter in it may.
            
            
               No Luck did follow this same Jest,
               The VVind blew hard at the Southwest:
               On sixteenth day, it blew a storm,
               But yet the small men took no harm;
               Only a little separated,
               Some Leagues asunder, being parted:
               We bore up Helm, and lookt them out,
               Before two days were past about;
               We did them bring once more together,
               For all the late fierce stormy weather.
               Only one Ship did go astray,
               He was cross grained known, alway.
               
                  
Of the West Country him we found,
               With Kiick down, near Table Round:
               Sir John his Pinnace sent Aboard,
               But he would scarce give them good word:
               Do what we can, proffer a Tow,
               This cross-grain'd man won't with us go:
               Perhaps his Ship he hath secured,
               And then her loss may be indured;
               And by her loss, he will get gain,
               Although his poor men suffer pain:
               For they their VVages all are forcst,
               To loose, if in this Nature crost.
            
            
               Now we have calm days, two or three,
               For the late storm indured we:
               But on the two and twentieth day,
               The VVind came to Southwest, I say;
               It only breath'd a little while,
               Poor simple Saylors to beguile:
               God send it fair, for we would fain,
               With joy Old England see again.
               Now for Rocoeta we did steer,
               Which is to Almarea near:
               Here is a Castle doth command,
               Three or four Guns which in it stand.
            
            
               The little Dartmouth, and the Kent,
               Alongst the shoar from us they went;
               To look that same West Country Hick,
               Which at our Kindness once did Kick:
               Now they haveorders him perforce,
               To take, which for him will be worse.
               
                  
Himself he cannot well excuse,
               Sir John his patience to abuse.
               The three and twentieth day fore night,
               Of this Rocoeta we got sight;
               Until next day there we did Ride,
               With all our Merchant Ships beside.
            
            
               Likewise the three and twentieth day,
               Of this same January we;
               Our Ships sides scrapt, and also paid,
               On upper Streaks, we Blackin laid:
               On four and twentieth day, we then
               Did hele our Ship, and make her clean:
               And from Rocoeta we did weigh,
               On that same four and twentieth day;
               With small Levant, and easie Gale.
               On Afternoon we did set Sail.
            
            
               Good Wind there is at this same place,
               But yet the same is something scarce:
               Their Sheep and Poultry is not scant,
               But yet the same cheap price they want.
            
            
               The Kent and Dartmouth, when we weigh,
               We saw in Almarea Bay;
               With that some small West Country-man,
               Which they in Tow, had got a Stern;
               All this same night, with handsome Gale,
               Alongst the Shoar we bravely Sail;
               But this same little Levant Wind,
               Till next day only stands our Friend:
               So calm it proved then withal,
               It would not fill least Sail, though small.
               
                  
And on the twenty seventh day,
               It came to the Southwest, I say:
               Once more we from Rocoeta steer,
               And then we went a Fishing there;
               Where we got store of Mullets Fish,
               By Spaniards counted dainty Dish:
               The thirtieth day we weigh again,
               The Hills all full of Fogs, and Rain:
               Which Spaniards count, sign of Levant,
               Which the next day did not want.
            
            
               A great disaster now befel,
               To our Cooks Mate, which now I'le tell;
               With bag of Rice, nigh hand a Peck,
               He stood at Capstant bout his Neck;
               Which he had pincht at times away,
               His place he lost by it, I say:
               I shall not name him, but a place,
               He did not want, though they were scarce;
               For they a Swabber of him made,
               Though he lik't best his former Trade;
               Now he must Swab first here, then there,
               They make him flourish every where:
               The poor man lives a Life so bad,
               Twould make some Hair-braind man go mad
               But this himself he comforts by,
               The Voyage doth to an end draw nigh.
            
            
               This was the Day, oth' Marryrdom,
               Of Charles the First, King James's Son;
               And our Kings Father, who did Die,
               By  
                  ands, sad, Tragedy.
               
                  
Therefore each Ship his Colours bears,
               But half mast up, in mournful ways;
               And Sir John, he doth first begin,
               To Fire, as to a Burying:
               Each Gun a Minutes space asunder,
               And so the whole Fleet, they did thunder;
               Which made the Spaniards greatly wonder.
            
            
               There's naught uncertain more than wind,
               And Money called, a she Friend:
               For on the one and thirtieth day,
               It chopt about again, I say:
               But on the first of February,
               It came unto the Eastward bravely;
               And blew a fresh Levant withal,
               Which fill'd our Sails, boh great and small;
               So that upon the third day we,
               The Town of Malhago did see:
               And then it left us to our fortune,
               The winds being various and uncertain.
            
            
               This Malhago, we drunk good store,
               And dear we paid for it therefore:
               Though Spaniards sold it at cheap price,
               Our Hucksters they were over wise:
               For now three pounds a quarter Cask,
               They sold it for what they would ask:
               They had it now without dispute,
               It would a bought a man a Sute:
               'Tis for Pay-day, that now they drink,
               Which e're it comes, long time they think.
               
                  
Therefore to drink away sad care,
               For price these poor men will not spare:
               Now each man his half quarter Cask,
               So common was, as if a Flask.
            
            
               A week in this same muddy sort,
               We Rid, methoughts it was good sport;
               To see them reel about with Casks,
               As at Legorn they did with Flasks:
               But I that week, was out the way,
               Which I want sorry for it, I say.
            
            
               Until the tenth day, here we Rid,
               With all our Fleet also beside:
               Now for next Tavern we are bound.
               Therefore from hence we did break ground▪
               The Boatswain winds his cawl, get bars,
               In Capstant, come let's to the Wars;
               My Boys, to Cales we next are bound,
               And then adue to Spanish Ground.
               A fair wind now we did not want,
               For we did get a strong Levant;
               Which unto Cales did bring us bravely,
               The thirteenth day of February▪
               Where we did than Sir Edward see,
               With several Ships of Merchantree:
               Likewise his Squadron there most bold,
               Which for Turks ships, won't be contrould.
               The Hampshire we did find, and Portsmouth,
               The Victory Fire-ship, and the Nonsuch:
               The Argeire Frigot likewise we,
               There at an Anchor now did see.
               
                  
All which belong'd unto his Squadron,
               Besides of Merchant Ships, a Chaldron:
               For always when you come to Cales,
               You find the Harbour full of Sails.
               Sir William Jennings, he came in,
               The sixteenth day with Merchant-men:
               He then the Princess did command,
               The Falcon did his second stand.
            
            
               His men his Livery did wear,
               Ashoar at Cales, most brave and fair:
               I mean his Boats-crew for his love,
               From them no time he will remove;
               For he great love hath for his Crew,
               The truth I'le speak, give him his due.
            
            
               The twentieth day, with Falcon he,
               And several Ships of Merchantre:
               From Cales Road, then did Sail away,
               Bound for the Straights they were, I say;
               For they that time fair Wind had got,
               Therefore they weigh'd, and lingred not.
            
            
               February one and twentieth day,
               We all from Cales did Sail away:
               'Bove forty Sail, both great and small.
               From Cales that day, we Sailed all.
            
            
               Sir Edward Sprage, came out that day,
               But yet he Sailed not away:
               He for some▪ Victualers then did tarry,
               Up in the Straights with him to carry.
            
            
               The VVind being Notherly we Sale,
               Unto the Westward, with brave Gale:
               
                  
Adue to Spain and Spanish ground,
               Now to Old England we are bound.
               You English Giles, look in your Glasses,
               For now we fancy English Lasses:
               Your Spanish Girles no more we'l fancy,
               But Peg, and Mol, sweet Sue, and Nancy;
               And we'l bring home some Spanish Sherry,
               On purpose for to make you Merry.
               Long time 'twas since our last Adue,
               Yet oft-times have we thought on you;
               And many a cheerful Spanish Cup,
               In your remembrance we have Supt:
               Indeed the same did you no good,
               But yet it cheer'd, and warm'd our Blood:
               We long to see you, may our Sails,
               Be always full of Southwest Gales;
               And then in short time we shall come,
               Once more to our desired Home:
               Upon the three and twentieth day,
               We Cape Saint Marys saw, I say▪
               The Winds hang Notherly, therefore,
               For better dayly we Implore.
               The seven and twentieth day than we,
               Five Portugals did see at Sea;
               An Admiral, and Vice-Admiral,
               With three Sail more, which were but small.
            
            
               New Moon, New Month, New Wind,
               The first of March, did stand our friend;
               For now it came to the Southwest,
               Which to you well is known the best.
               
                  
And boldest for us may it stand,
               Till we get sight of English Land:
               Where we our old Friends then shall see,
               I hope with Mirth and Jollity:
               Then all the Hardship we endured,
               This Voyage, in one month will be cured.
               When we get with the Maids to play,
               When they are making of the Hay;
               The Milkmaids Pales, we seize on shall,
               Drink up their Milk, and pay for't all.
               Though they at first are something nice,
               With them we will not stand for price:
               Good Sack we send for Sullebubs,
               We drink them in these Milkmaids Tubs;
               And more than that, we an't such Clowns,
               But we will give to them green Gowns:
               If they so willing are as we,
               'Tis ten to one but that may be▪
               But hold my Muse, with sorrow mourn,
               Because the VVind doth forwards turn:
               Our Sheets hald Aft, and Tacks Aboard,
               On second day, upon my word.
               But yet we hourly hope the best,
               That it will come to the Southwest:
               Our Prayers at this time God did hear,
               For fore 'twas night the VVind came fair:
               At the Southwest, with merry Gale,
               Till two a Clock third day we Sail;
               And then it chopt up to the West,
               Which is not bad, nor yet the best:
               
                  
But if it doth not over blow,
               Our Course we bravely still shall go.
            
            
               On fifth day, then the VVind did come,
               Unto the South, but blew not home:
               And on the sixth to South-Southwest,
               Which was as good as was the best:
               The Mary her Main-top-mast lost,
               This day by fortune being crost:
               We straight ways after her did bear,
               And proffered help what we could spare.
               They gave us thanks for our good will,
               But they a Top-mast had got still;
               And Men and Seamen did not want,
               With speed to get the same Alant:
               Her Top-mast, Mainsail, split that day,
               Which they unbent without delay:
               This same mischance was Afternoon,
               But she her Geer did six full soon:
               Eor fore that it was night than we,
               Her Top-mast through the Cape did see▪
               Next day full soon it was a Taunt,
               And may it stand I pray God grant▪
               For Sir John Harman will not loose,
               Her company for Friends nor Foes:
               All other Ships he left to follow,
               If they did please the Frigot Swallow;
               He and the Dartmouth, by the Mary,
               Let VVinds blow fair, or contrary▪
               She carry doth on Poop a Light,
               And we keep near to her all Night.
               
                  
I in the Mary now do Sail,
               Towards Old England with brave Gale:
               And about this time a Coat I wanted,
               Which by some Verses soon was granted;
               For cause the VVeather it was cold,
               These Lines to rights, I strait-ways Scrould:
            
            
               
                  C ontrary VVinds and VVeather bad,
                  A watch Coat's good, being thinly clad:
                  P ray be not angry, I Rehearse,
                  T o you my mind, Sir, now in Verse:
                  A watch Coat 'board of the Saint David,
                  I had the Boat-swains, and did wear it:
                  N ow I have none, though it be cold,
                  E nough is said, I'me something bold.
               
               
                  H Owever cold, yet in a storm,
                  U seful 'twould be to keep one warm:
                  N ow I suppose 'tis high time,
                  T o end at present this same Rhim.
               
            
            
               This same I writ in windy Night,
               When that the cold did me despight.
            
            
               The wisht effects these Verses had,
               For I had Coat, me warmly clad:
               Thanks I return unto the Giver,
               I wish I may such Coat want never.
               
                  
Of Northern Cape we had the length,
               By vertue of this same VVinds strength;
               But now at eight a Clock at night,
               The VVind came forwards, Oh despight!
               But who can help this same misfortune,
               This Marches weather's most uncertain.
               The eighth and ninth, VVinds Nor-Nor-west,
               Did coldly blow, I do protest:
               But yet we hope that better VVind,
               Will in short time now stand our friend.
               The tenth day in the morning early,
               The VVind came to the VVestward bravely;
               Then from the VVest to Sou-sou-west,
               The VVind most bravely did increase:
               And yet again in Afternoon,
               Unto the VVest, but soon was done;
               And to the Northward it did Veer,
               Uncertain VVinds this month there are;
               With mizling Rains, and haizy weather,
               The VVind is fickle all together.
               At twelve a Clock at Night it came,
               To the South-east, but almost calm;
               From the South-east, to the South-west,
               It came, and then we thought the best:
               Because it round the Compass run,
               At that same season with the Sun,
               But yet the same had quickly done.
            
            
               For we did find to our hard fortune.
               The VVinds once more to be uncertain.
               
                  
For Northerly the VVind it came,
               And very hard did blow the same;
               For four days space fierce stormy weather,
               With shores of Rain, and Gusts together▪
               But when the stormy Gusts were past▪
               Brave sereen weather came at last.
               For on the sixteenth day we Sail,
               Almost quite calm, with easie Gale:
               And now we hope that change of VVind▪
               At this same time will stand our friend:
               VVe are befriended with fair weather,
               And little VVind four days together:
               From us by English Ship we hear,
               The Lizard doth Northeast now bear;
               From it 'bove fourscore Leagues we are,
               I wish that we had VVind was fair;
               In little time we should it Sail,
               Had we but handsome Top-sail Gale.
            
            
               The Mary on the eigteenth day,
               New Top-mast did get us, I say:
               The former being old and crackt,
               This last they set it nothing lackt;
               They in Main-top-sail two ▪eefs had,
               Low set to carry in weather bad:
               Before perforce they hand it must,
               For every suddain stormy Gust:
               Or else a sprung a Mast for we,
               This March bad weather find at Sea.
            
            
               On nineteenth, and on twentieth day,
               From North, to the Northeast, I say;
               
                  
Once more into that hole it came,
               Though we hop't better of the calm.
            
            
               'Bout ten days space, we weather had,
               Thick as Peas Pottage, very bad:
               It is that time to make the Land,
               For fear of some sunk Rock, shoal Sand:
               Yet day by day, we soundings had,
               Of fair England, which made us glad:
               At length to our exceeding Joys,
               We sight of Land did get, brave Boys.
               The Hardship we before endured,
               At this same time was all quite Cured;
               Our Joys at this time did exceed,
               On Deck we threw our Caps indeed:
               Nay, some that time did on my word,
               For Joy, their Caps threw Over-boatd.
            
            
               Oh fair England! Thy lovely Banks,
               I see once more, I give God thanks.
               I always loved my Native Land,
               England shall have my Heart, my Hand▪
               If War do chance, my dearest blood,
               I will not spare to do Her good;
               According to my poor endeavour,
               My King and Country, I'le serve ever:
               Though in Condition of mean sort,
               I never will be sorry for't.
               I still do hope before my end,
               That my condition, it will mend:
               The boldest Captain's but a Servant,
               And we to them must be observant.
               
                  
Yet can I not but pine to see,
               A Coward raised to high degree:
               But God be thankt, our Marshal Law,
               Doth such base Traytors, Hang and Draw.
            
            
               By Dedford Town, Example there,
               Was for such Blades, for to beware;
               How they such Places take in trust,
               Except that they were Stout and Just.
            
            
               But hold my Muse: Where dost thou run?
               'Tis time for thee, for to have done,
               The Voyage doth now draw to an end,
               We for to the Downs, our Course do bend:
               The VVind from VVest, to Sou-sou-west,
               Did bravely blow, I do protest:
               Which made our hearts & minds more merry,
               Then when we drunk the Spanish Sherry.
               It was the last of March that we,
               Englands Lands end did bravely see:
               And on April the second day,
               Into the Downs we got, I say:
               Not one days Victuals was on Board,
               When we came in, upon my word.
               Our Bread and Cheese, we had made even▪
               But we got more, thanks unto Heaven:
               For here Provision we shan't want,
               The same in England is not scant.
               Pray God we may receive our Pay,
               When we get up, without delay:
               In misery they spend their Money,
               That spend it fore that they get any.
               
                  
And at Pay-day their Landlords come,
               And take away the Total Sum:
               Now to return a little back,
               And speak of the great Mary's lack:
               Her company in foundings we,
               Did loose in that great Fogg at Sea:
               Her absence did Sir John much trouble,
               Because his care for her was double.
               To seek her, time he can't afford,
               Provision was so scarce Aboard:
               Into the Downs arrived we,
               On Sunday: Tuesday in came she;
               And did salute us with nine Guns,
               We seven strait-ways her returns;
               She three returns for thanks with speed,
               Great Joy on both sides was indeed.
            
            
               Reader, this Journal now is done,
               Because of our safe home return:
               If that Kings Ship no Voyage make worse,
               The Nation needs not grudg their Purse:
               The Prayers of Merchant-men we have,
               For from the Turks their Ships we save:
               With us no Ship did e're miscarry,
               Sir John so wise was and so wary:
               If ought they wanted in their need,
               Unto Sir John they came with speed;
               For to supply them in their want,
               He unto them vvas never scant.
               I many Instances could name,
               But vyhat need I speak of the same.
               
                  
Cause Sir John Harman's so well known,
               To all the world, more than to one:
               My simple muse cannot rehearse,
               Half Sir Johns Merits, in good Verse:
               A Theam too high for me to Write,
               Though I do throw in my poor Mite;
               Let better Wits him Eternize,
               I must confess my self unwise.
               Captain Darcys Merits must have share,
               In little Dartmouth, for his care:
               
                  eing Sir Johns Second, it was great,
               Although he were in a Fifth Rate.
            
            
               Sir John, he says, Pray Captain go,
               And back a Stern, take such in Tow;
               No sooner said, but forthwith done,
               About the Fleet he'l nimbly Run:
               And heavy Saylors bring away,
               Into the Fleet, without delay.
            
         
         FINIS.
