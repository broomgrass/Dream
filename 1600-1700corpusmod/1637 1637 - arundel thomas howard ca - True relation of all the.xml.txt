         A
RELATION BY WAY
OF
IOVRNALL, &c.
         THE seventh of April being
Thursday, 1636. His Excellency
departed from Greenwich for
Germanie, tooke Barge about
three of the clocke in the morning,
and landed at Gravesend,
from thence by Coach to Canterbury
to bed, the next day to
Margate where wee dined, and about three of the
clocke in the afternoone, hee tooke shipping in one of
the Kings Ships called the Happy Entrance, and landed
the tenth day being Sunday at Helver-sluce, and from
thence to the Brill, there sailing over a lake into Masanssluce,
and so on by waggons to Delph, and to the Hage:Hage.
but a mile before wee came thither, there met us some
of the Queene of Bohemia's Coaches, which her Majesty
sent for his Excellency, and in one of them his Excellency
went to her Majesty that night, the time we staid
there, was spent in visits betweene the Prince of Orange,

his Excellency and the States, with some other Ambassadours,
that were then there, as the French, Venetian,
and the Swedish, heere we staid three daies, and departed
the fourteenth day by wagons, passing through
Leiden to Woerden, and then entred the Bishopricke of
Utrecht,Utrecht. and so to the City it selfe where wee lay, the
Princes being there at schoole, his Excellency went
to see them that night, the next day thence to Rhenem
to dine, where the Queene hath an house adjacent to
the Rhine, on the left side, which wee viewed, having
faire roomes and gardens belonging to it, after diner,
wee entered into Gelder-land, so through Wagening to
Arnheim to bed, passing that afternoone through
much danger, by reason of Out-lyers from the Army
at Schenckenschans, which was not farre off, the Prince
of Brandeburgh being heere in Towne, visited his Excellency
the next day, and the day after his Excellency
visited him, who was shewed by him, the ashes of
some Romanes preserved in pots, that were found
in a Mountaine called Zanten, which wee afterward
passed by, heere wee lay Easter-day and the Munday
following, and did see the smoake and fire out of
the great Peeces from the Sconee, as they were in
skirmish, thether his Excellency sent the Steward
and a Trumpeter to demand passage of the Spanyard
in the Schans, and Grave William for the Hollander,
but the Spaniard would not grant it, without order
from Brussels, Grave William hearing their answer, sent
his Excellency word, hee made no doubt, but to give
him free passage the next day, for he resolved to make
an assault that night upon the Sconce, upon the assault,
the Spaniards yeelded it up on conditions, and heere

his Excellency published certaine orders, to be generally
observed amongst us, one reason was, the sickenesse,
being heere very much, wee staid heere three
daies and departed the nineteenth in waggons for the
Schans, first crossed over the Rhine just by the towne on
to the right side into Cleveland, and so to the Tolhouse,
a Castle where the Hollanders take toll at, adjoyning
to the Rhine on the same side, then passing through all
their workes and Army, leaving the Schans at a distance
which was miserably battered, untill wee came
to Grave William his Tent,Schenshants. where some of the Spaniards
were sealing of their agreements what quarter
they should have, who instantly left them, to bring
his Excellency over the Rhine on a Bridge of flat bottom'd
Boates, guarded with all his Troopes of Horse,
untill wee came at the Barke wherein his Excellency
lay that night, then returned and sent a Company of
English Souldiers to guard it, the next day earely wee
weighed Anchor and sailed up the Rhine, having a
Guard of Souldiers along the shore, by reason the
Enemy went out of the Schans that morning, so passing
by Emmerick and Rees, Townes with strong sconces
adjoyning to the Rhine on the left side, then in sight
of the Mountaine Zanten on the other side, so by Burick,Wesell.
on the same side, to Wesell a Towne on the left
side of the Rhine, against which wee cast Anchor, and
lay on ship-board all night, for they died there of the
sickenesse more than thirty a day, neverthelesse the
next morning we tooke waggons in number eighteen
and displaied our English colours in three severall
wagons, passing over a little River in Boats call'd Lipp,
then by Rheinbergh on the right hand being the last

Towne of the States, then by Dinslacken, on the same
side to Dinsburgh to dinner, where none of our carriage
might enter in, for as his Excellency entered the gate,
one of the watch discharged his peece neere unto the
horses breast, the rest being instantly commanded to
the contrary, but the Gates were shut up, and wee
kept out, untill the Towne were satisfied, wee were
no Enemy, our carriage and Company being great,
frightened them at the first after diner we past through
a long Wood in much danger, and in the view of
Rogues, who did not set upon us because our Company
was great, yet we fearing the worst, had sent for
a Convoy of Musketiers to the next Towne before,
who met us not untill we were out of the Wood.
         Then wee entered into Bergish-land, and went by
Keiserswert to Dusseldorp to bed,Dusseldorp. which adjoynes to the
Rhine on the left side, where the Duke of Neiuburgh lay,
who was with his Dutchesse abroad taking the aire,
but espying us comming, returned backe into the
Towne with speed, and sent to have the Ports shut up,
thinking wee had beene some Enemy, but hearing it
was his Excellency was very joyfull, and sent Coaches
for him, to come and suppe with him, and to make his
house his lodging the time he staid, but the next morning
after breake-fast, perceiving his Excellency would
goe away, had three Coaches waiting at the doore,
into one hee put his Excellency, and us into the rest,
and brought us out of Towne, with a Company of
Horsemen and Foote in Armes, and a Troope of Lances
going before, and Trumpets sounding about the
Coach, his owne Guard; being thus brought without
the Gates, hee tooke his leave of his Excellency

and returned, and as wee were departing, there went
off great peeces of Ordnance.
         Thence neere Neusse, and then crossed over the
Rhine at a little Dorpe called Hittorpe, into the Territory
of Collein,Collen and then to the City where we lay. It is
seated on the right side of the Rhine, where the Bishop
of Mentz was, who sent one of his Privie Counsell
to invite his Excellency the next day to diner, he then
sent three of his Coaches for us, and gave his Excellency
very noble entertainement; the first night his
Excellency came, were presented unto him twenty
foure Flaggons of severall kindes of Wine, the next
day twenty eight, and at every Present, there was a
long speech made to his Excellency in Latine by one
that came with the Wine, which came all from the
Magistrates of the City in Flaggons with the City
Armes on them, the Jesuits there have built them a
very stately Church and richly adorned it with gildings
and erected an Altar one of the state liest, I ever
saw, in the City likewise there is a great Church called
the Dome, wherein lye the Bodies of three Kings,
called The three Kings of Collein, which went to worship
our Saviour, then is there another Church called
Saint Ursulas, in which lyeth the bones of 1100. Virgins
in places locked up, and Saint Ursula in a faire
Tombe by them, which came all thither with her for
their Devotion, there is besides a Nunnery and some
English Nunnes there.
         Heere we staid a weeke, and the twenty eighth day
wee tooke a Boate drawne with nine horses and went
up the Rhine, by many Villages pillaged and shot
downe, and many brave Vineyards on Mountaines, along

the Rivers side, passing by Bonn on the right side,
and seven high Burghens with old Castles on them,
seated on the other side of the River, and to Drachenfels
Castle on the left of the Rhine, against which wee
cast Anchor and lay that night on ship-board, the next
morning earely weighed Anchor, passi 
             an Island
in which is a Monastery of Nunnes called onenwerther,
so on by Hammerstein Castle by Keigrmagen Andernach
and Ormus three Townes on the right side of
the Rhine, against Ormus wee cast Anchor and lay on
ship-board.
         The next day earely weighed Anchor and went by
Engers on the left side, and there begunne Trierischlandt,
and so to Coblentz a Towne adjoyning to the
Rhine on the right side,Coblentz. which the French lately lost,
being driven out by the Emperours Forces into a Castle
seated on a very high Rocke, opposite to the
Towne called Hermanstein, which commandeth the
Towne, who were then skirmishing when wee came,
wherefore wee cast Anchor about halfe an English
mile before, and sent a Trumpeter desiring passage,
which they willingly granted, ceasing their fight on
both sides, the Generall in the Towne making preparation
to entertaine his Excellency, did but open the
Gate, thinking to cleare the passage for his Excellencies
entrance, presently they in the Castle let flye a
Cannon and were like to have slaine some of them,
wherefore they withdrew from shewing of themselves,
untill his Excellency came against the Gate,
and then came forth and intreated his Excellency to
dine with him, but hee staid not having a long way to
goe that night; they in the Castle are besieged on

every side, before them are Cannons placed just by
the Rivers side, behinde them are a great company of
Horsemen called Crabbats, beyond them in a plaine
great field, are other Horsemen and Footemen, and
likewise in Islands in the Rhine, all watching that they
cannot be relieved, they in the Towne, if they doe but
looke out of their windowes, have a bullet presently
presented at their heads, yet the Towne is somewhat
the stronger for a River called the Mosell, which runneth
along one side of the Towne into the Rhine, over
which there did stand a faire Bridge, though part of
it now be beaten downe, that there is no passage over,
but have made a little lower on the Mossell a passage
on Boates, to relieve the Towne, under the Castle
there is a very beautifull house, which the Emperour
gave to the Elector of Tryer, and hee resigned it to the
French, whereupon the Spaniard besieged him, when
he lay in a faire Castle on the Mossell called Tryer,
and tooke him prisoner, and is prisoner now: as wee
were departing from hence, the French gave us a brave
vollie of shot as hath beene heard, with foure or five
peeces of Ordnance, from hence up the Rhine, by
Lonstein and Branbach two Townes on the left side, and
Capelle a Castle on a Rocke on the other side, to Boppart
a Towne on the same side, against which wee cast Anchor
and lay aboard.
         The first of May being Sunday, and their Whit-sunday,
we departed, passing by Villages shot downe,
and by many pictures of our Saviour and the Virgin
Mary, set up at the turnings of the water, untill we
entered the Land of Hesse, where we still viewed pleasant
Vines on the Mountaines, so by Saint Goware, and

by Rhinefilds Castle both on the right side, to Catzenelbogon
Castle on the other side, then by Oberwesell
on the right side; then begins the Lower Palatinate,
so by Caub on the left side, which is the first Towne
in the Pfaltz, and so to Pfaltz Castle, seated in a little
Iland in the River,Bacharach. from hence to Bacharach, a Towne
where we landed, it is seated on the right side of the
Rhine, having a Castle on a high Rocke within the
walls, and under that a Church, which is from the
plaine ground 100. steps before one can come into it,
heere the poore people are found dead with grasse in
their mouthes: from hence by a Village on the same
side, in which none but Leapers are, being not farre
off the Towne, and so to Hambach on the same side,
by Drechshausen on the other side, to Armanshausen,
a Towne on the left side of the Rhine, against which
we cast Anchor and lay on Ship-board.
         The next morning departed hence, and then begun
Momtzistzland, so by a little Tower in the water,
called Mouse Thour, which one Otto a Bishoppe
of Mentz, having lived not well, being much troubled
with Mice, built this, and lived in it, thinking there
to be secure, but even thither they pursued him also,
and eate him up: then by Bingen, a faire Towne on
the right side, and by Ehrenfels Castle on the other side
to Rudeshein, a Towne on the left side of the Rhine, into
which I entered, and did see poore people praying
where dead bones were in a little old house, and
here his Excellencie gave some reliefe to the poore
which were almost starved as it appeared by the violence
they used to get it from one another: from
hence by Geisenhem, Elfeld, and Wallaff, three Townes

on the left side of the River, and then we crossed over
the Rhine, unto the other side.
         Then to Mentz a great City seated close by the
Rhine on the right side against which wee cast Anchor
and lay on ship-board,Mentz??? for there was nothing in the
Towne to relieve us, since it was taken by the King of
Sweden, and miserably battered, there the King of Bohemia
dyed, in a faire corner house towards the Rivers
side, heere likewise the poore people were almost
starved, and those that could relieve others before,
now humbly begged to bee relieved, and after supper
all had reliefe, sent from the Ship ashore, at the sight
of which they strove so violently, that some of them
fell into the Rhine and were like to have bin drowned.
         The next day being the third of May, from hence
wee departed, leaving the Rhine halfe a league above
the City on our right hand, and entered into a shallow
River called the Maine, passing by a place which
the King of Sweden was building for a Fort, but could
not finish it, then by Cassell, on the left side, thence by
Flersheim on the left side to Russelsheim on the right
of the Maine,Francfurt. and then to the stately City of Francfurt,
adjacent to the Maine on the left side, where we
landed and lay: from Collein hither, all the Townes,
Villages, and Castles bee battered, pillaged or burnt,
and every place wee lay at on the Rhine on ship-board,
we watched, taking every man his turne; heere wee
staid foure daies, untill our carriages were made ready:
where we saw the place wherein they keepe the Dyet,
afterward entered into the Church called Saint Bartholmews,
where the Emperours use to bee crowned and
take their oath; the City is inhabited with Lutherans

and Iewes, for in the Iewes Synagogue, I entered in to see
the manner of their service, which is an undecent way,
making a hideous noise, having on their heads and about
their neckes things called Capouchins, the women
are not admitted into their Synagogue, but in places about.
And on Sunday the seventh of May, by waggons
through the City over two Bridges which are alwaies
guarded with Souldiers, leaving the Maine on our left
hand, from hence we tooke a Convoy of Musketiers along,
being wee went through much danger, by Offenbach,
Selgenstat, seated betweene us and the Maine,
passing thus along through a great Forest in much danger,
hearing the great Peeces so swiftly discharge off
at Hannaw, which the Swedes subdu'd, and now besieged
by the Emperors Forces, being not above three English
miles off, then by a very great Mountaine two English
miles long, all beset with Vines, untill we came at
a poore little Village where wee staid and dined with
provision of our owne, and after dinner departed, passing
through Plaines untill wee came at the Maine, and
there ferried over into a towne called Klingenberg, passing
through this, we came to a very high hill the way
up being all stone & 2. English miles up to the top, and
then through a Wood, after we were past this, we came
to a poore little Village called Neunkirchen,Neunkirchen. where we
found one house a burning when we came and not any
body in the Village, heere we were constrained to tarry
all night, for it grew very late, and no Towne neere
by 4. English miles, spending the night in walking up
and downe in feare, with Carrabines in our hands, because
we heard Peeces discharg'd off in Woods about
us, and with part of the coles of the consumed house

his Excellency had his meat rosted for supper, the next
morning earely, his Excellency went to view the
Church, which we found rifled with the pictures and
Altars abused, in the Church-yard, we saw a dead body
scraped out of the grave, in another place out of the
Church-yard, there lay another dead body, into many
of the houses wee entered, and found them all empty.
From this miserable place we departed, and heard after,
that they in the Village fled by reason of the sicknesse,
and set that house on fire at their departure, that Passengers
might not be infected.
         Then came we into Wijrtzburg-land, and descended
downe another steep hill and there crossed over a little
River call'd Tauber, and through Keichelsheim, to Neubruim
a poore Village where wee dined, after dinner
passing by the side of the Maine, and through Woods
and Plaines,Wurtzburg untill we came to Wijrtzburg, a faire City
passing over a bridge first, standing over the Maine into
the Towne, seated on the left side of the River, and a
faire Castle opposite to the Towne on the other side,
in which the Towne put all their riches when they
heard the king of Sweden was comming, thinking there
it would not be gain'd, but they hearing of it, surprised
and pillaged it in 3. daies, and it was 3. or 4. moneths before
the Emperors forces could regaine it, the next day
earely departed, being the 10. of May, and entered
Marggrafen-land, and to Kiteingen to diner, after diner,
thence through Ipza a City,Marckbibrach and so to Marckbibrach,
where we lay all night on the plancher, for the Village
was pillaged but the day before, earely the next morning
wee went away and passed through Neustadt,
which hath beene a faire City, though now pillaged

and burnt miserably, heere we saw poore children sitting
at their doores almost strav'd to death, to whom
his Excellency gave order for to relieve them with
meat and money to their Parents, from hence we went
to Eilfkirchen a poore Village where wee dined, with
some reserv'd meat of our owne, for there was not any
thing to be found, after diner, thence we passed by many
Villages pillag'd and burnt down, and so into Nurnberger-land,
passing through the place where the King
of Swedens Leaguer lay, when the King of Bohemia was
with him and my Lord Craven, and in sight of the place
the Emperors Army had intrenched themselves by the
side of a great wood, here the King of Sweden set upon
poles alive three of his souldiers, for killing 2. of their
Commanders, and flying presently to his Enemy, and
at the end of a Battaile that was then fought, he tooke
them prisoners, and so executed them, then drawing
neere Nurnburg a great City seated in a Plaine,Noremberg. which
the King of Sweden relieved at that time against the Emperor,
being not above two English miles off, heere we
passed by some of their workes before the Towne, and
then entered the Gate into the City being very stately
built, and one of the strongest in Germany, and so to his
Excellencies lodging, the next day the Lords of the
City came and visited his Excellency; here we staid II
daies untill his Excellency had word for certain where
the Emperor was, the most part of our time was spent
in seeing of the rare things in the Towne, as a very
brave Magazine wherein all their munition lieth, which
the Governours of the towne shewed his Excellency,
at our first entrance wee passed through a large Court
where there lay on our left hand 4. great Cannons by

the walles side, which were 6. paces long, and 2. foote
broad, and worke-houses there likewise, then entered
we into a long roome where there hung on both sides
armour for foot and horse, and then into the place it selfe,
where there were 6. partitions each 28. paces long and
6. broad, all full of brasse Peeces and other small ones
of severall rare inventions, from hence we went to see
a very rare water-worke which supplieth all the City,
adjoyning close to the wall of the Towne, returning
homewards, we entered into their great Church call'd
the Dome, there his Excellency was shewed a very stately
picture of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, which
hung in the middle of the Quire, drawne up, which had
not bin shewed to any in 18. yeeres before, and then return'd
home, and the Lords with him, who supped with
his Excellency, the next day they dined with him likewise,
and after diner desired his Excellency to goe and
take the aire in some of their Gardens without the City,
which he did: the City is very strong being encompassed
without the wals with bulwarkes and a mighty
deepe and wide ditch, and within are many curiosities
and stately buildings: the ancient men (called Lords)
governe by turnes, not acknowledging any particular
Prince their Soveraigne, but hold correspondency with
all, for in the time of those great wars between the Emperor
and the King of Sweden, they would resigne to the
Emperor one while, and to the K. another, paying great
taxes & impositions to their halfe undoing. Fro?? hence
we departed May 22. being Sunday, for Regenspurgh,
thinking there to meete with the Emperor, first pssing
through a part of the upper Palatinate to Newmark,Newmark.
where we lay, seated in a plaine where the king of Bohemia

had a house, which his Excellency viewed, adjoyning
to the wall within the Towne, fortified with
bulwarkes and pallizadoes, having spacious roomes and
a faire Armory: early the next morning, from hence, by
Churches demolished to the ground, and through
Woods in danger, understanding that Crabbats were
lying heere about, untill we came at a poore little Village
called Hemmaw where we staied and dined, which
hath beene pillaged eight and twenty times in two
yeeres, and twice in one day, and they have there no
water but that which they save when it raineth: after
dinner, to Ettershansen a poore Village where we crossed
over a little River in Boates, the Bridge being
burnt downe by the Swedes forces; from hence wee
ascended up a high hill, being descended downe, wee
passed a long on an high banke, having the River Danubius
on our right hand, and high Mountaines with
Vines on our left, passing thus through severall Villages
beaten downe or burnt, untill we came at a round
Fort before the Bridge which a guard kept, and so over
it through a Tower in the middle standing over
the Danuby, which runneth with as swift a current as at
London Bridge, dividing it selfe into severall Ilands
which have had howses on them, but now burnt, and
also houses on the Arches which were demolished
likewise,Regenspurg. then into the Citie Regenspurg to his Excellencies
lodging, the Citie hath bin taken by the Swedish
forces, and regained by the King of Hungary.
         The 25. day his Excellency went to take the ayre on
the other side of the Towne, and as we went did see
the ruines of many houses and Churches, and one Carthusian
Monastery not so much ruinated as the rest, into

which his Excellency entered to see the roomes
wherein the King of Hungary did lie all the time hee
was regaining of the Citie, being not above two English
miles off it, and heere likewise the old Duke of Bavaria,
this Dukes Father lived in a Cell for many yeers
together, againe his Excellency went to take the ayre
the 28. day, and entered into a Jesuites Monastery, in
which there is one Altar dedicated to S. George; here
his Excellency staied a weeke, and departed thence
for Liniz, where the Emperour was, taking foure
Boates and went downe the Danow thorough Bavaria,
passing by a Castle called Donastauff, seated on a high
Mountaine, with a Dorpe at the foote of it, adjoyning
to the Danubij on the left side, and by Werth Castle on
the same side,Straubingen to Straubingen on the same side where we
landed about eleuen at night and lay that night; the
next morning from thence, still by many ruines to Pogen
on the right side, at the foote of a very high Mountaine,
and on the top of it a Church with a few houses
about it; then by Nuternberg Castle seated on a high
Mountaine on the right side of the River, and by Deckendorff
on the other side, against which wee met with
thirty horses fastened all to one rope drawing of sixe
great boats which were going to Regenspurg, then by a
Castle called Tawrin seated on a high Mountaine, and
below at the bottome is a Towne walled round, called
Overwinter on the left side,Vilshoven. and so to Vilshoven, a towne
on the right of the Danuby where wee landed and lay
that night. The next morning as his Excellency was
taking Boate, he spied a poore Boy standing among other
poore people begging for reliefe, who looked very
strangely and could neither speake nor heare, but a

little at his mouth and nose, having neither eares nor
passage to heare with, and his face very thin & drawne
aside, yet when one hallowed hee heard and answered
againe with a noise, there was with him his sister, a pretty
girle, who when one spake to him, made him understand
by signes, these two his Excellency tooke along
with him in his Boate to a City called Passaw seated on
the right side of the Danuby, where we landed & lay,
and there common ded to have new clothes made for
them & gave them monie and sent them home to their
freinds, and a little before we came thither, endeth Bavaria;
this Citie is seated very sweetly, having 3. rivers
running neere it, the Danuby which is of a green color,
incompasseth it of one side, and a swift river called Inn,
on the other side, which commeth out of Italy, and is
of a white color, the third is Ilze, which is very blacke,
and commeth out of Bohemia, and both runne into the
Danuby at the end of the towne, the next day his Excellency
went to view a Capuchine Monastery, seated
very pleasantly on a high hill, neere unto the Towne,
first we passed over a bridge made of little rafts which
standeth over the river Inn, and so through Instadt, and
then ascended up the hill upon which the Monastery
stands, and then entered into the Chappell called our
Ladies Chappell, being built in the yeere 1636. where
we saw a neat Altar, and a picture of the Virgin Maries
set up in the Altar, and many fine reliques, left there
of those that are said to have been healed of severall
diseases, comming but thither to doe their Devotion,
and returned thence sound, from hence we descended
to another Chappell at the bottome of the hill, passing
downe 274. steps, being set in order, 10. and 11. together.

and as much plaine ground as containeth the steps
thorow out the whole descent, and in the middle of
the descent is a Crucifix, at which one daily sits to receive
the almes of charitable people, which Crucifix
one rude person passing by, strucke it, and fell
downe dead and never revived, as these Capuchines related,
and then returned. And opposite to the citie
on the other side of the Danuby on a very high rocke, is
seated a strong Castle which cannot be scaled, called
Festingoverhouse, commanding all the Townes and Monasteries;
at the foot of this is another strong built
Fort, by which the river Ilze falleth into the Danuby,
betweene the towne Ilze and this: the citie is
governed by Leopoldus the Emperours second sonne,
who is Bishop of it; here we stayed three dayes, and
departed the fourth of Iune, and entred into upper
Austria, passing by Schaumberg castle on the left side of
the river, and by Effertingen on the other side, and
Wilhering Monastery on the same side,Lintz. to Lintz where
the Emperour was, who sent to receive his Excellence
at his landing the Count of Harrack, Marshall of
the Court, with some other Courtiers; after his gratulation
with his Excellence, there came ten or twelve
coaches, which waited on his Excellence to his lodging
which the Emperour had provided, and then returned.
Presently after came the Count Megaw, high
Steward to the Emperour, to visit his Excellence; and
the next day Count Mansfelt Captaine of the Foot-Guard
to visit his Excellence, and after him Father
Lemmarman, his Majesties Confessour.
         The sixth of Iune, being the second day after wee
came, his Excellence had audience of the Emperour

and Empresse, who sent their coaches for us; being
come to his palace, which is seated on a hill, we went
up foure ascents of staires, the Guard standing on each
side of us, with halberds and carrabines in their hands,
passing thus thorow roomes, untill wee came at the
doore of the chamber in which the Emperour was,
and when his Excellence came at the doore, out came
the little Count of Kezell, high Chamberlaine to his
Majestie, and brought in his Excellence, and then
withdrew and shut the doore after him, that none
might enter in: after his Excellence had beene within
a while, we were all admitted, and kissed his Majesties
hand, and then withdrew, and passed thorow other
roomes and a gallerie, where the Guard stood in like
manner, to the Empresses chamber, where none
might enter neither, stealing a sight of her as wee
stood, and then returned.
         The eighth day his Excellence had his second audience
of the Emperour, as private as the first: and
the tenth day audience againe of the Empresse, and
then wee were admitted to kisse her hand: the same
day there were seven men beheaded which were Rebels,
for rising up in armes with foure hundred other
Boores against the Emperour: the first that was executed,
was said to be one that had inchanted himselfe,
that no bullet could hurt him, and the onely seducer
of the others: after he was upon the scaffold and his
face covered, two men held him fast to the blocke,
then came the Executioner with a red hot paire of
pincers, and violently clapt hold of both his brests,
that done, nailed his right hand fast to the blocke, and
chopt it off, then presently whipt out his sword from

his side, and cut off his head, one of the hangmen
presently tooke it up, and cryed at the eares of the
head, Iesus, Iesus; then the Iesuite which came a long
with him admonishing of him, desired everie one to
joyne in prayers with him for him; then came the other,
and a Boy which was beheaded likewise, all making
their private confessions to Priests, at the foot of
the scaffold, having a Crucifix in their hand, kissing
their hands & feet at the end of everie prayer: After
all those men were beheaded, and quartered, there
went two of their confederates a foot to bee hanged
about an English mile off, to a place where a Priest of
theirs hung upon a pole, and his head on the top,
which was taken in a Church a yeere before called
Ering, which we afterward passed by.
         The twelfth day being Sunday, the Emperour, Empresse,
and the Arch-Dutchesse, dined at the Iesuites
College; but before, they heard Masse in their Church,
and after dinner a play was presented to them by the
house, and some young schollers, consisting of many
varieties. The fifteenth day his Excellencie dined at
the Count Megaws, and was nobly entertained: the
sixteenth day as we were at dinner, there came a mightie
clap of thunder and lightning, which burnt downe
three houses presently, being not above an English
mile off, on the other side of the water, and such accidents
happen here often, by reason all their houses
be covered with thin boord, in the manner of tile;
and about foure of the clocke in the after-noone, his
Excellence had audience the third time, and we all invited
to a Balto, by the Empresses command, to the
Count Slavataes, who is Chancellour of Prague, where

            
            
            
            
all the Ladies assembled, and there spent the time in
dancing: in Moravia not farre from this place, there
was a Baron whose name was Rabell, having a wife,
which couple had beene married fortie yeeres together,
and had many children, and when he was eightie
two yeeres old, and his wife seventie five, she conceived
and brought him forth two children at a birth, a
sonne and a daughter, which children lived a yeere
and died, and then presently after their parents both
died, and was buried in S. Michaels Church, a Church
of the Dominicans in Brune, a towne in Moravia: this
storie was related to us by a Priest of the Empresses
for certaine; here his Excellence stayed nineteene
dayes, and all the time at the Emperours charge, and
served by his Majesties servants, in as much state as he
himselfe; at the first course the Drums beat up, and
at the second, musike with voyces.
         From hence we tooke boat for Vienna, the three and
twentieth day of Iune, passing downe the swift river
Danuby, neere the Church called Ering, wherein the
Boores assembled and chose that Priest, who was taken
and executed as afore-mentioned, so by a faire castle
called Spiulbarke, where the Duke of Bavaria makes
his Toll-place seated on the left side of the river, then
by Markhawsen on the same side, by Walzig a faire castle
seated on the other side on a high hill, and the
towne at the foot a little beyond, so by another faire
castle called Crayne, seated on a high rocke close by the
Danuby, on the left side, the towne at the foot of it,
both belonging to the Count Megaw: then thorow a
place in the water called the Struddell, where it runneth
very swift, with a great fall amongst the rockes,

and dangerous to passe, having no more space than the
breadth of a boat, which if it toucheth, breakes into
many peeces, and over this place on a high rocke is a
Crosse set up, having past this danger, just by on the
left side of the River is an old Chappell called S. Nicolas,
out of which came two men with his picture in a
box, to receive an accustomed reward due from those
which passe by safe: from hence by a faire castle called
Besinboe, seated on the same side on a rocke, and by
Pekelem on the same side, then by Wednick castle seated
on a rocke on the left side, with a village beneath it,
so by a castle and monasterie encircled with a wall,
seated on a verie high rocke called Milke, and the
towne at the foot of the rocke along by the Danuby on
the right side, part of it burnt by an accident when
the King of Hungary was in it, and by Sable castle on a
high rocke on the same side, with a faire banquetting
house, which belongeth to the Grave Sturbutz; and
a little further on the same side, is another banquetting-house,
called the Devils banquetting-house, by
reason of many apparitions there seene. Then to a
little poore Dorp called Aspagh on the left side of
the Danuby,Aspagh. where wee went a shore and lay that
night.
         Earely the next morning, being the foure and
twentieth day, we went up the river by a castle called
the Spitz, seated on the same side, so by Stiringsteine, a
faire towne on a rocke adjoyning to the river on the
same side, with a ruinated castle over the towne on a
hill, with rocks on both sides, which are the Grave
Van Seldingz: then by another faire towne seated on
the same side called Stine, from which there standeth a

bridge over the Danuby made of rafts, having thirtie
seven arches, under which wee passed, and at the end
of it, opposite to the towne is a monasterie with many
faire houses belonging to it, and behinde this is another
stately built monasterie, called Kitne, seated on
a hill: from this an English mile distance, with a delightfull
prospect, just by are two other faire townes,
the one Crempz, and the other Winsell, seated both on
the left side of the Danuby in a plaine, which three
townes are within the compasse of an English mile;
then by Tolnie a towne on the other side, which is the
oldest towne in all the Empire, against which wee lay
a while and dined on ship-boord: after dinner wee
entred into lower Austria, and went by an old castle
called Griffopsteine, seated on a rocke on the same side,
in which all Priests that offend are imprisoned and
tried.
         Then a Dutch mile further, on the left side, the
Danubius runneth out to a faire Towne called Cornybrough,
seated an English mile off in a Plaine with
faire Monasteries therein, then on the other side of
the river is Cloysternybrough, full of Cloysters and Monasteries;
so by Nustorffe on the same side, from
whence we discovered Vienna, seated in a Plaine, then
left the Danu, which divides its selfe into sever all branches
and meet beyond the Towne, and runs thorow
Hungary into the blacke Sea, and went up in an arme
of it to the Citie, where wee landed, seated on the
right side of the Danu, which is very well fortified
round the wals, besides a compleat Regiment of 1500
men alwayes ready in armes, part watching at everie
gate, some about the Emperours palace, others about

the place where the Iewes keep their shops in the Citie,
for they are not suffered to lye in the Towne a
night, but constrained to keepe within a place on the
other side of the River opposite to the Citie, which
they have built, and is called the Iewes Burg; for if
any one be found all night in the Towne, he is miserably
punished, if not put to death: there are likewise
7000 Burgers in the citie, which are to be in armes at
an houres warning.
         The next day being Sunday, his Excellence had audience
of the Queene of Hungary and the Arch-Duke
Leopoldus, the Emperours second sonne, being the 26.
day, and nothing wee saw note-worthy at his palace,
but a spacious Court-yard: the next day againe his
Excellence went to see the Dukes lodging, where we
saw onely a few pictures; from hence he went to severall
houses of the Iesuites, the first was a University,
where was presented to his Excellence a kinde of Comedy
by young Schollers in masking attire, and one of
the house playing on an instrument like a Virginall,
severall kindes of musicke; after that, a banquet
brought in by the Actors: this ended, we went to the
second house called the Probation-house, where none
but young men are, about fiftie in number, there to
be tried whether they may bee made capable of holy
orders: thence to the third house, called the Profest-house,
where none but the ancient Fathers are, where
as soon as his Excellence entred, an oration was made
to him by one of the chiefe, & after viewed the house
and Church, in which there was an hymne sung by
their best singers, with very sweet musicke, and they
have an organ of five thousand pipes. From hence

wee returned home to our lodging, where there
came presently after the Prince of Ducardins to visit
his Excellence.
         The eight and twentieth day his Excellence went
to see a garden of the Emperours about a Dutch mile
off, called Nigobath, upon which place the Turke once
intrenched himselfe, when hee would have taken Vienna,
and was then two hundred thousand men strong,
in the Emperour Rodolphus his time, and after they
were driven out of the countrey, the Emperour built
this on their works for a memoriall, the garden is almost
foure-square, encircled with a strong stone wall,
and at every corner a faire Tower, and in the middle
two, with three partitions in everie one, and the tops
covered with brasse, round within the wall is a walke
for two to goe a brest, covered with brasse, and underset
thicke with pillars of stone: then returned wee to
another very stately large garden of the Empresses
neere unto the citie, called her Favorita, having severall
small gardens adjoyning to it and a faire house:
the next day his Excellence went to see the Queene
againe, and the two Princes her Sonne and Daughter
here we staid a weeke, and departed the first of Iuly
by waggons for Prague, passing first over three long
bridges handing over severall branches of the Danubius:
so by the wals of Cornyburgh the towne aforementioned,
to Stackay a poore village where wee dined,
after dinner by Kildersdorf to Holebrum a poore
village,Holebrum. where wee lay all night on the straw, having
travelled seven Dutch miles, and every Dutch mile
is foure English, where six and twentie houses were
burnt that day fortnight wee came, by thunder and

lightning, the next day early from hence passing thorow
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping,
we came to Kudordorp, where Moravia begins in a great
plaine, where two stones are set in the ground, dividing
Lower Austria and Moravia, then past we thorow
Colendorp the first towne in Moravia, and by a Crosse
standing in a plaine not neere any towne, with many
graves about it,Swamb then to Swamb a prettie towne where
we dined, having past that fore-noone in danger neere
a great company of Crabats, who were thereabouts,
who frighted the towne: for when his Excellencies
Harbenger entred the gates an houre before us, they
were all shutting up of their shops, and running out
to defend the towne. After dinner thorow most
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping, untill
wee came at Bodewich, a poore village,Bodewic where wee lay
on the plancher, and travelled that day seven Dutch
miles.
         The next day being Sunday, and the third of Iuly,
we stayed there untill dinner, and thence thorow
part of a wood called Hertz-waldt, on a causey two English
miles long, the wood being three hundred miles
in length (as we were credibly informed) passing thorow
we saw severall fires in it, & many strange things
are likewise seene, and so by Bernetz, a little towne at
the end of the wood, to Iglo,Iglo. a beautifull built towne
seated on a little hill, where we lay that night, having
gone foure Dutch miles and an halfe. Earely the next
morning from thence passing over a River at the end
of the towne, which parteth Moravia and Bohemia, and
then thorow Stickey the first towne in Bohemia, so thorow
Haybeireitz a village, in which an Oast killed at severall

times of his guests ninetie men, and made meat
of them, so to Dutchbrade a towne where wee dined,
and then departed, passing thorow a plaine wooddie
countrey to Holebrum, where we lay that night on the
plancher, which was a most fearefull night of thunder
and lightning, having travelled seven Dutch miles.
         The next morning wee departed, and went thorow
a wooddie countrey againe, and thorow a towne
called Shasshaw where in the street we passed thorow,Shasshaw.
lieth buried the body of one Iohn Ziska, who made
war against the Emperour Rodolphus, in the defence of
his deere friend Iohn Hus, who died a Martyr: this
Iohn Ziska in all his wars was a victor, and when hee
was blinde desired to bee carried up and downe the
wars, and at his death commanded that a Drum might
be made of his skin, which was done, and wheresoever
that was, they subdued likewise; then by a silver
Mine of the King of Hungaries, which was by the way
side on a little hill, into which wee entred to see their
works, the oare being two hundred and fiftie fathom
deepe, and behinde this place is a citie called Kettenburgh,
which wee left two English miles of our left
hand and thence to Colen two English miles off likewise
where we dined; about part of the towne runs
the River Elbe: after dinner we past thorow a plaine
countrey to Bemishbrade,Bemishbrade. where wee lay on the plancher
againe, having travelled eight Dutch miles,
which hath beene a faire built towne, and very pleasantly
seated, but now burnt almost downe by a Carpenter,
when the Emperour was in it, and since been
pillaged twice, by the Swedish, and the Duke of Bavaria
his forces.
         
            
The next morning earely, being the sixth of Iuly,
from thence to Prague to dinner,Pragu being five Dutch
miles, passing first thorow very pleasant plaines and
meddowes, vntill we came neere the citie, which is encompassed
on both sides with rocks and hils, all planted
with vines, having three townes belonging to it,
Newstadt, Oldstadt, and the Slostadt; at Newstadt wee
entred in at a faire gate, passing thorow into Oldstadt,
to his Excellencies lodging, which said Stadt is inhabited
chiefly by Iewes, who have there foure Synagogues,
and in one I saw there a Rabbi circumcise a
child, here we were told that all their fruits in the further
parts of the countrey were spoyled, as corne,
vineyards, and the like, by the aforesaid thunder and
lightning with hailestones as big as ones fist, and also
divers cattell were then lost: between this and the
Slostadt runneth a pleasant river called the Muldow, and
over it standeth a faire Bridge of stone, as long as London
Bridge, over which his Excellencie passed, going
to view the Castle, being a stately large built Fort,
seated on a high hill within the Slostadt, called Ketschin,
in which the King of Bohemia lived??? first wee passed
thorow three faire Court-yards, having at one of the
gates a guard of Souldiers in which Court-yard there
is a statue of S. George on horse-backe in brasse, and a
fountaine, then entred we into a spacious hall, having
many faire shops in it like unto Westminster, but that
their Courts of Iudicature are in other roomes by it:
from hence wee went up and passed thorow many
faire roomes well hung, and pictures in them, and one
roome furnished with English pictures of our Nobilitie,
which the King of Bohemia was forced to leave,

passing thus untill wee came at one roome two stories
high, which was their Councell-chamber, where the
Bohemians being sat at Councell, and three of the Emperours
Couucell with them, there rose a mutiny, insomuch
that they threw them three out on the
ground, which was fiftie five foot high, and shot pistols
after them, yet none of them killed, and two of
them still alive, and upon that ground they fell on are
set set up three gilt crosses: then went we downe into
a stately lower roome, which used to bee their masking
roome, upholden with severall faire pillars, in the
middle, and statures of brasse placed by them; by the
wals hang pictures of Indian horses which were there
then; adjoyning to this is a large dining roome, having
a table in it of Mozaique worke, and musicke
within it not to be discerned, then at the end of this
roome is a little place where choyce armour is, and
one Piece which I saw shot off a bullet, not having any
powder in it: then into the Schaut kamber, where the
treasure was, and a most noble collection of the Emperour
Rodolphus.
         In the first roome was cup-boords placed in the
wals on our right hand; the first was of corall; the
second, of Purslaine; the third, of mother of pearle;
the fourth, of curious brasse-plates engraven; the fifth
and sixth. Mathematicall Instruments; the seventh,
Basons, Ewers, and cups of Amber; the eighth, cups
of Aggets, Gold and Chrystall; the ninth of rocks;
the tenth, of Mozaique worke in stone; the eleventh,
cups of Ivorie, and a great Unicornes horne a yard in
length; the twelfth, of imbossing worke; the thirteenth,
of Brasse pictures; the foureteenth, of antick

things cast in silver; the fifteenth, cabinets of Bohemia
Diamonds, and little chests of Bohemia pearle; the
sixteenth, things belonging to Astronomy; the seventeenth
and eighteenth, Indian worke; the nineteenth,
Turkey-worke; the twentieth, of a lively
statue of a woman covered with taffatie. Then in the
middle of the roome are rare clocks of all kinds; the
first was like a globe with musike; the second was set
round about the middle with little pillars, and a bullet
running round in a cresse out and in, and over it hung
two little cords, which being puld, wee heard sweet
musike, but could not discerne from whence it was;
the third had a faire lively face and hand looking out,
and musike with voyces singing, not to be discovered;
the fourth, a close clocke, and by it a faire table of Mozaique
worke; the fifth, with foure ascents set severally
with pillars, and a bullet running round in a
cresse up to the top, playing with musike; the sixth,
like the top of a globe, the gold coloured like a green
field, and a Bucke running round in and out, and
hounds after making a noyse, and beneath musike, and
Anticks, dancing in a round within it; the seventh, a
clocke with a globe: by the wals on the other side anticke
things set up, and pictures, together with a steele
chaire very curiously wrought and cut thorow. Then
entred wee into another little closet, wherein were
more cabbins placed in the wals on the same side, of
presents sent to the Emperour, as gilt helmets and
head peeces, and statues.
         In the third roome, foure cup-boords in the wals
full of rare pictures, and in the middle of the roome
anticke things, as a Bore rough cast to the life, and a

statue of a strong Maid to the life, who went to war,
and a presse of ancient bookes. The fourth roome,
three cup-boords full of the Anatomies of severall
rarities, as Cockatrices, and fishes part resembling
men; and the fourth cup-boord of rare great shels;
the fifth, of fine dishes; the sixth, of all kinde of little
shels, and a Librarie, with one mightie great booke in
folio, written by a Fryar in a dungeon, who was there
put in, upon some hainous offence there to suffer, and
fortie yeeres after discovered by some Fryars going
neere, hearing a noyse, had search made, and found
him, who brought forth this booke, consisting of the
old and new Testament, and many strange histories,
which hee was all that time a writing, and assisted by
the Devill (as he conceived) and spake very little more
before he died.
         Here is likewise all the skins of those Indian horses,
whose pictures hung up in the masking roome: then
did wee enter into a large Church, standing neere about
the middle of the Castle, where about the Quire
are cut in wood many fine things, and a tombe of the
Queenes Confessour, called Iohan. Nepomews, who was
miserably tortured by Wenceslaus the fourth King of
Bohemia, to reveale her Majesties confession, and at
last put to death by him, Anno Dom. 1383, from hence
his Excellencie went to view a garden behind the castle
within the wall, where wee went in a walke covered
arbour-like, halfe an English mile long, untill we
came at a stately old building, with walkes round the
house, and set thicke with pillars and likewise on the
top of the house, with a delightfull prospect over all
the citie, and then his Excellencie returned backe to

the Keepers house, and there dined, having sent provision
before: dinner being past, his Excellencie went
to see a Parke two English miles off the Citie, in which
there is a Friarie of white Friars, who were leaping
then in the Parke, as wee passed by to see a great beast
called a Buffule, which is kept there, and then returned
home by Wallensteines new house, into which his
Excellencie entred to view it, first passing thorow a
large hall of eight and thirtie paces, or more in length,
and one and twentie in breadth, we went up thorow
galleries having pictures hung up, and painted on the
wals with stories of Hercules, above head divers stories
of Ovid; then to the Audience-roome, where the
foure elements are in the middle above head, and thorow
other faire chambers; then downe into the garden,
where there are five fountaines, and great figures
of brasse placed on them, and on the great fountaine
Neptune, with foure Nymphs about him, and a faire
Grott-house, but the waters run not; then into the stable,
being curiously built, where six and twentie horses
may stand, the pillars and manger all of red marble,
and thirtie eight in number, and each pillar cost
twentie five pounds, there are foure Court-yards
which encompasseth the house, which is now the
King of Hungaries.
         This Wallensteine was sole Commander of the Empire,
under the Emperour, and grew so great, which
caused his Majestie to be jealous of him, as he had just
cause considering his plots which hee had laid against
the Crowne; but to prevent the worst, privately
tooke order with some of his Irish Captaines, who
were appointed to keepe watch of him that night, to

cut him off, which was effected in the evening, pressing
on the sudden into his chamber found him onely
in his shirt, and said, Live Ferdinando, but dye traytour
Wallensteine; at which he opened his armes and cried,
Oh my God, embracing the stabs of the halberds, which
done, they cut off his head, and presently posted to
the Emperour with it, who gave them great rewards,
and they still continue much in his favour.
         The next day his Excellence was invited to a play
at the Iesuites College, where the Senior of the house
is an Irish man, and there entertained Prince-like;
first, an oration by a young Scholler, then passing
downe by a Guard of Souldiers, who discharged their
muskets: his Excellence being past to the roome
where the Comedy was acted, which action did please
exceedingly, not onely in respect of substance, but
also for the goodnesse of the action and severall habits,
in number more than fiftie, the chiefe part were
young Schollers, and divers of them Barons sons, and
being ended, desired to kisse his Excellencies hand
kneeling, in testimony of his approbation. And here
is the argument annexed in the page following.

         Here we stayed seven dayes, and departed the thirteenth
of Iuly for Regenspurg by waggons, over the
plaine where the great battell was fought, betweene
the Emperour and the King of Bohemia, not above two
English miles from the citie, there wee did observe
many places in the ground, wherein the dead bodies
were put, and a great company of bones lying by on a
heape, where were slaine in all on both sides about
thirtie thousand: from thence thorow a plaine corne
countrey, to a little towne three Dutch miles from
Frague, called Beroum, where wee lay, which towne
hath beene burnt by the Duke of Saxon his forces.
The next morning earely wee went thorow plaine
corne-fields and meddowes, untill we came to Mauth,
a poore village where we dined: from thence thorow
woods, and by poore villages burnt, to a prettie
towne called Pilsen, where we lay that night, having
travelled seven Dutch miles, it is seated in a plaine,

with three little rivers running by it, as Misen, Glatow,
and Pilsen, taking the name from the towne.
         The next morning thorow a wooddie countrey
and corne-fields to Swabe to dinner; after dinner to
Bishopsteine to bed,Bishopsteine. having this day travelled but foure
Dutch miles, in which the Count Dorfmastaff hath a
little castle pleasantly seated, and the river Igree running
about part of it, the towne was never pillaged as
yet. Earely the next morning from thence passing
thorow a very stony hill, and a wood foure English
miles in length, called Bemer-waldt, wherein about the
middest there is a Schans, in which Count Mansfelt and
his Armie lay two moneths, at which Schans the upper
Palatinate begins. Then to Waldminiken, a little towne
to dinner, the first in the upper Palatinate; and the
Oast of the house did serve Count Mansfelt as Ancient
at that time: after dinner thorow a wooddie
poore countrey to Redtz a little towne where we lay
that night, having travelled six Dutch miles.
         The seventeenth day being Sunday, early we departed,
passing thorow great woods, in danger of the
Crabats lying thereabouts, and carried out of our
way by by chance through an ignorant guide, untill
we came to Bruke, a towne miserably ruinated, seated
pleasantly in a plaine, where there was not above
foure poore housholds remaining: not long since it
was in great prosperitie; for when wee were a little
past the towne, there was a gallowes and scaffold by
the way, whereon the Burgers of the towne suffered,
and many hanging still, who were Lutherans: then to
a towne called Nettenow to dinner, and from thence
after dinner to Regenspurg, having travelled seven

Dutch miles this day, passing first thorow many
pleasant places of landskips, and over the river Regen,
(which runneth into the Danuby just by the citie) passing
over on rafters, the bridge being beaten downe
then with the other former batteries: between Vienna
and this place, are many faire built townes promising
much, by reason of their severall Piazzo's, or Market-places
and Fountaines, with other such expressions,
but entring the houses, scarse finde men, lodging, or
people of understanding to exchange discourse with.
The next day after his Excellence came hither,Regensp the
Ambassadour of the Elector of Brandenburg visited
him; and the day after his Excellence visited him againe;
here his Excellence stayed but foure dayes,
because the Emperour was not come, and departed
for Augusta, on Thursday the one and twentieth of
Iuly, and dined that day at Sall, a small towne on the
Danuby, thence thorow Bavaria to Augsburg, a verie
fine towne standing on the river Volga, which a little
before fals into the Danuby, and thence that night to
Neistadt, a faire towne ten miles from Regenspurg,
where his Excellence lay that night.
         Next day earely passing thorow a fine wooddie
countrey to Bezanzon, where my Lady Abbesse gave
his Excellence a banquet, from thence after dinner to
Palermo, a stately towne,Palermo and there lay that night, having
travelled seven Dutch miles. Satturday being
the three and twentieth of Iuly, we departed for Augusta,
passing thorow part of Tiroll to Mumantia, burnt
some two yeeres since by Generall Cleandor, one of the
King of Swedens Colonels; and from thence to Dole,
which hath been a verie pleasant situated towne, standing

on the brow of a hill, from whence at the distance
of three English miles we beheld Augusta, which
towne of Dole was also with Bezanzow burnt by Colonell
Cleandor two yeeres since, passing thorow this
towne, we descended into a goodly valley, but ere we
gut into it, went over a small arme of the river Tanais,
(which encompasseth Augusta on the West, as the river
Vindilicorum doth on the East) passing this valley,
which is the more famous, in respect at the upper end
of it was fought the great battell of Pharsalia, between
Pompey & Iulius Caesar, from whence it takes the name
of the Plaine of Pharsalia: drawing neere Augusta, we
passed over five bridges standing over the river Vindilicorum,
which is divided into so many branches so
running with so many Bulwarks: the river water is of
an excellent greene colour, which is caused (as they
say) running out of Copperas mines, which are in
the mountaines of Dalmatia, from whence it springs,
taking its name from Vindix a famous Captaine, who
first rebelled against Nero, passing over all these bridges,
we entred the outer towne, which is well built,
and so in at a broad port thorow the high street to his
Excellences lodging, that day and the next was spent
in seeing pictures: Munday being the five and twentieth
day, his Excellence went to see the Stadt-house.
First you must understand it to bee a square pile, of
at least one hundred foot square; in the middest against
the street, yee enter by a large paire of staires
of thirteene steps, into a stately lower roome supported
by twelve Calcidonian pillars, opposite to which
against the wals stand the images of the first Caesars,
which because they were written under,
         
            
I will mention as first, Augustus the City Founder,
from whence it takes the name, then Tiberius,
Nero, Sergius, Andronicus, Meleager, Themistocles,
Lysimachus, Orion; Phoebus, Enobarbus, and
Barbarossa, over it in another roome which to come
to, wee passed up sixe and thirty staires which as
the other was supported by twelve Pillars of Corinthian
worke and Jasper stone, in which is painted
to the life (which they say, was done by
Apelles and Michael Angelo, the one the master
the other the man) are the Images of Lycurgus,
Zeno, Aristocrates, Aristides, Agathocles, Phocion,
Anaxagoras, the first Triumvirat of Rome,
thence by thirty steppes more into the State-house
it selfe, which is a most curious peece of Worke,
without Pillers, peeced with Onyx and Smarage,
two excellent kindes of Marble, found in the Teneriffe
a mountaine of Tiroll, it is about the Walles
painted with the Stories of all the gods, painted
by Raphael Urbine, some twelve yeeres since, against
this State-house stands a goodly Fountaine
in the middle on a Pedastall of Brasse, the Statue
of Augustus environed with all the gods and goddesses
to the number of forty in Brasse in Polonian
Cassockes and Turkish Scymiters by their sides, in
the middest of the high street is another of Mercurie,
and at the farther end Hercules in a Lions
skinne killing of Hydra with his seventy heads all
in Brasse, which as soone as he strikes off one head,
two ariseth in the place, there are besides in this
Towne many other rare things, as an Arsenall brave

Monasteries Fugger house, water workes most innumerable
and admirable rare and curious buildings
and what not to delight the eye, heere his Excellency
staied a weeke. And thence on Sunday,
hearing the Emperour was a comming to Regenspurg,
departed that day being the one and thirty

Mountaines of Tiroll to Niburg, where wee lay
being seven Dutch miles, a stately Towne from
whence the Duke of Niburg takes his name, it

of Epirus.
         The next day through Swaben and to Ingolstate

and killed his Horse under him, whose skinne is
preserved still for a Relique in the Arsenall, it is
the stronger having the Danu and a large Plaine on
the South, and the swift River Rhodanus on the
North, which not above a mile before falles into
the Danu.
         The next day which was the third of August

at Regenspurg, passing first by many small places not
worth the naming except Rellein, a great Towne
which had anciently beene a Colony De Corvinus,

building of Stone, above an hundred paces in length,
passing first up 5. ascents of Staires, & through a long
Gallery 90. paces long, ruffe cast with severall stories,
and at the end entered into a square chamber, which

sometimes is their Councell-chamber, so into the second,
third and fourth roome, which is twenty eight
paces long, and twelve in breadth, painted above
head, and carved very richly; and on one of the Walls
hang the Pictures of the sixe Caesars; First, Carolus

         From hence, we went to view one of their Houses,
in which amongst the rest of his Pictures, was the
picture of his Grandfather, who had neyther nose nor
chin; as the picture demonstrateth; and then presented
his Excellence with a Banquet: from hence to another
faire house adjacent, and very well furnished
likewise, but before we came into the rooms, we went
up the curiousest Stayre-case of stone as ever I have
seene.
         And from hence to the Castle, where the Father of
one of the Lords lived, who after he had shewed his
Excellence all the roomes in the Castle, which adjoynes
to the wall of the Towne, standing on a Hill, and a
very deepe Well of one hundred and fifty Fathom,
cut out of a Rocke, by which they were constrayned
to releeve the Towne, in the time of their former
warres, betweene the Emperor, and the King of Sweden;

he presented his Excellence with another banquet,
and then returned home.
         The next day, which was Sunday, they all dined
with his Excellence.
         And in the morning being the 14. day, wee departed
having stayed heere three dayes, and tooke a Convoy
of 100. Musketiers along with us to Neustadt, five
Dutch miles; The first night, travelling part by
Torch-light through the Woods, and there lay on
the straw that night: which Towne formerly hath
beene inhabited by 250. Burgers or more, and not
having now five in it.
         The fifteenth day earely, thence to Ketzen five
miles, and there lay on the planchers likewise; and

Dutch miles,Wirtzburg staying that night there, having no other
Towne neere to goe to. After dinner, the Lords
of the Towne sent his Excellence a present of Two
and thirty Flaggons of Wine, Fish, and provision for
his Horse.
         The next morning before his Excellence departed,
he was visited by the Bishop of Wesburg, whom wee
found, in the habit of a Countrey Gentleman, setting
aside his Order, which is an enamelled Crosse hanging
on a Blacke ribbon about his necke; who made
very much of his Excellence, and presented him with
the Picture of our Ladie, done by Albertus Durerus,
being one of his best peeces; and then tooke leave of
him, who was ready to ride out of Towne, to some
other place for safety, the Swedes being within two
dayes march of it, and then his Excellence returned

to his Lodging, and presently went away.
         The seaventeenth day, taking a fresh Convoy went
to Bishopsheim that night,Bishopsheim. a Towne seated in a bottome,
and incompassed round with Hills, having the River
Tauber running about part of it, belonging to the Bishop
of Mentz; travelling this day foure Dutch miles
and most part through great Woods.
         Earely next morning, thence through Klsen a Village,
and divers other poore Villages burnt and pillaged,
passing through a hilly wooddy Countrey in
much danger of the Croats, and spying some running
up and downe in the Woods, being round about us,
in number 6000. or more, dispersing themselves into
severall Companies, pillaging and robbing of the
Countrey; travelling this day five miles to Mildebarke,Mildebarke.
but a Dutch mile before wee came thither, entered
into our old way at Nunkirken, the poore burnt
Village before mentioned, which is now inhabited by
some Foure or five poore people.
         The 19. day in the morning, from thence another way,
taking another fresh Convoy, leaving our old way and
the Maine on our right hand, passing along by the
side of it, through Hybach a Village, and a faire House
which is the Bishop of Mentz likewise, and through
other Villages miserably battered, and in Plaines
some sixe English miles in length, untill wee came to
Selgenstadt,Selgenstadt. having gone this day sixe Dutch miles.
Falling into our old way within one mile of the
Towne, travelling all those dayes in danger of the
Croats, where as soone as his Excellence lighted, the
Grave Vandosme Governour of the Countrey for

the Bishop of Mentz, sent his Excellence a present
of halfe a wilde Bore, and likewise provision for his
Horse; knowing that the Towne could not affoord
any thing.
         The twentieth day being Sunday, early in the morning,
wee went thence to FrankfortFrankfort to dinner, which
was three Dutch miles.
         And the next morning after, his Excellence went to
Hannaw to visite Sir Iames Ramsey,Hannaw. a Scotch Gentleman
and Governour of the Towne, and there stayed that
night, who met his Excellence without the gate with
a troupe of Horse, and entering the Towne there went
off a brace of Canons, and when his Excellence lighted,
went off two more by the doore of his Excellencies
lodging; which Towne, was besiedged a Yeare and a
halfe by the Emperours forces, and at the beginning
of the Siege had such a grievous Plague, that there
dyed in 7. Weekes, 22000. yet for all this, they kept
out the enemy, though in great want and misery, and
three months since it was releeved by the Landt-grave
of Hesse, who slew a great company of the Imperialists
and drave the rest away; for as wee passed by afore
at a distance, we heard them as they were in their
skirmish. The next morning, his Excellence went about
the Towne to view the Workes, which are very
strong, scarce to bee scaled by any force, having two
Engines made but of six Musket barrels a piece, which
Dutch Engine dischargeth 80. times together, giving
fire to it but once; the Towne is seated in a plaine
ground, having the Mayne on the East, and incompassed
on the North and West, with the River Knitszig,

besides Moted round, and this River serveth 14.
Mills which adjoynes to the Towne, and before any
man can enter into the old Towne he must passe over
three Bridges, and through severall Bulworkes, and
over another into the new Towne; and at the releefe
of the Town, there was one Daniel Lauter a chiefe Burger,
dyed for very joy; he being above in his house and
seeing the victory, was overcome with such a mighty
passion of joy, that hee fell downe and dyed instantly;
there was likewise a woman, who killed many Dogs &
sold their flesh at a great rate to many people, and one
day as shee walked in the Streets, was like to have been
devoured by them, had not some poore Souldiers
by chance releeved her, who presently confessed what
shee had done formerly, acknowledging she had justly
deserved it; and after dinner his Excellence tooke
leave of Sir Iames Ramsey, and then returned backe to
Frankfort.
         The foure and twentieth day, foure of the Burgers
of the Citie came and presented their service to his
Excellence with twenty flaggons of Wine, and then
dined with him; here wee stayed three dayes untill
our Boates were made ready.
         And on Saturday the 26. day of November, wee departed
from hence, and rowed downe the Mayne;
the first night to Flersheym, which was three miles, against
which wee cast anchor and lay aboard; The
next morning launched forth, and past downe to
Mentz, and there his Excellence went on shore, to see
if it were any way inriched since our being there, but
alas, wee found it as miserable as before, with divers

poore people lying on Dunghils almost starved, being
scarce able to crawle for to receive his Excellencies
almes, and presently returning to our Boate to dinner,
wee afterwards releeved many poore hungry soules
with the fragments; Thence after dinner downe the
Rhyne to Rudeshem, which was five Dutch miles, and
there cast anchor, and lay on the boards likewise.
         Very earely the next morning wee weyed anchor,
and presently entred into a dangerous place to passe,
called Bingham-Locke, where the River Lo falls into
the Rhyne by the Towne amongst many Rockes,
which causeth a violent fall, tossing us up and downe,
that if wee had but touched any part of them we had
all been cast away; being past this, we came to Bacharach,
where, some of our Company did but goe ashore
(and presently hastened after in a little Boate,)
were pursued by five Musketiers almost to his Excellencies
Boat, who discharged very often at them, yet
by good fortune mist them, and having overtaken his
Excellence, they instantly fled away; then going on to
a large Iland an English mile from Coblentz, wee there
cast anchor and lay all that night; for wee could not
passe to the Towne without leave from the Governour,
by reason of severall watches which lay in our
way; which night wee lay in much danger, perceiving
them walke up and downe to catch a prey, for as
some of our company did but goe a little way from
our Boat, they were layd hold on, and one that fled,
had a Musket shot at him, and hee that was taken, they
caried before their Commander, who was in a Monastery
in the Iland, examining him, & then let him goe.

The next morning,Coblentz. his Excellence sent againe to the
Governour, for passage, who like a base fellow made
us stay that night also, and the next day untill three of
the clock in the afternoone, and would not let us passe,
for all that his Excellence had sent him the Emperors
Passe and Letter, wherein hee was commanded, not
onely to give passage, but, to assist him in any thing
hee required; yet for all this, hee kept us still, and
would not give way that our Trumpeter might goe
to the French in the Castle; but they perceiving how
unworthily hee did deale with his Excellence, discharged
4. or 5. Cannons at his house, and shot quite
through it, at last hee came at the third sending for,
with an excuse, hee was very unkindly delt with by
Cardinall Genetta, the Popes Nuntio, who lately passed
by, going to Colle, but stayed him three dayes first,
before hee let him passe, and made him promise faithfully
not to visit the French, but being got beyond the
Towne landed and went in, which made him vow
not to let any passe. But after that hee had talked a
while with his Excellence, gave leave to fall downe
neere the Towne, and having cast anchor, set a strong
watch about us, and then gave leave for the Trumpeter
to goe to Monsieur Salade in the Castle for passage,
who most willingly granted it, and sent his
Excellence a very faire ancient Picture; but hearing
by the Trumpeter the Governours base usage towards
his Excellencie, presently plac'd their Canons against
his house, and vowed his Sonne should give fire to
them the next morning, and would send him such a
breakfast, as that hee should need no dinner; in the

interim, there came a Lieutenant from the Governour,
upon a colour to visite his Excellence, who
proved a second Villaine in the end, for all that wee
used him very well, and fedde his hungry belly better
than it had beene long before; for the Souldiers
themselves confessed, that they had but one Browne
loafe and a halfe of Bread in eight dayes, and not one
penny of money; yet this Rascall lay lurking in our
Boate till our Trumpeter returned, and then violently
tooke him and the Skipper, and carried them into
the Towne and set a watch about them; and the next
morning, sent his Excellence word hee might passe,
but the Trumpeter should follow after; whereupon
his Excellence sent his Steward to know the reason,
who found them tyed by the Armes together, the
Skippers finger cut off, & the Trumpeters head escaped
very narrowly from being cloven in two, had not his
strong Hat defended it, and also had threatned to hang
them up the next day together, but with much adoe
hee brought them away with him, and after followed
a Gentleman to excuse that barbarous base usage of
the Lieutenant, and leave to passe, presently departing,
and being gone but a little past the Towne and against
the Castle, they saluted us, and said they would
drinke the King of Englands health, and then gave
fire to more than twenty thundring Cannons, beside
a brave volley of small Shot, which made their Houses
to smoake and tumble in our sight, but they durst
not returne one backe againe; the other Governour
Geats, gave us very noble usage, but this who was
lately sent, shewed himselfe so base, that he deserves

no name with us; from hence to Bonn, and there cast
anchor, but durst not lye nigh the Towne, the Sicknesse
being very sore in it, and this day rowed eight
miles.
         The next day being the first of December, in the morning
we went from thence to Collen,Collen. being foure miles,
leaving those delightfull Mountaines, Hills, and pleasant
Vines, and entred into a plaine Countrey, where
as soone as wee came into the Towne, neere the Palace
where the Cardinall lay, had information, of all
what the boorish Governour of Coblentz sayd of him
was false; wee stayed heere three dayes untill wee
had exchanged our Boates for bigger, and every day
his Excellence had presented unto him 24. Flaggons
of Wine, sent from the Magistrates; who once dined
with him.
         And on Sunday the 4. day of December, about foure
of the clocke at night tooke Shipping, and the next
morning at three a clocke set sayle, and sayled downe
by Mulheim on the left side of the Rhyne,Mulheim. and Sonts
on the other side, which belongeth to the Abbots of
Collen, where wee stayed to free Toll; then on by
Newse on the same side, where the River runneth out
to it,Dusseldorpe and so to Dusseldorpe, where as soone as we came
but neere the shore, out came the Noble Duke of
Neuburgh, and clambered over other Ships to come
into ours, to visite his Excellence, being much joyed at
his safe returne, and had made provision at his House
to entertaine his Excellence, but perceiving he would
not stay, sent for a wilde Bore, Wine, and five Pictures,
and presented them to his Excellence, then

tooke his leave, being very sory to let him goe, but
considering the time and tediousnesse of the weather,
was more willing to give leave, he staying by the shore
untill wee put off, and then went off 10. Cannons,
the Duke still walking along the shore as farre as the
water would give him leave, and stayed untill we were
out of fight. From thence by Keiserswert belonging
to the Elector of Collen, seated on the left side of the
Rhyne, where wee were stayed to free our Toll againe,
and at our lanching forth saluted us with one
Peece of Ordnance, so on by Ordingen a little Towne,
where on the other side, about a league further wee
cast anchor, against a small old Castle called Engersort,
sayling seaven leagues and a halfe this day, for
before wee went by miles, which were some foure or
five English miles at the least in length, but these are
but three English; this night wee lay in much danger,
for there did lye on each side of us, parties, which
robbeth and pillageth all Passengers; for wee saw above
fifty in a company, going all along by the shore,
but a little before wee cast anchor, and at 10. of the
clocke in the night being very darke, was a false alarum
given by the Watch of a partie comming, which
made us all flye to our weapons, at last perceiving it
was but one Boate, and they that were in it, crying
out Friends from the Duke of Neuburg, else wee had
shot them, who came for to have passage into England.
         Next morning earely wee weyed anchor, and went
part of the day in danger likewise, to Orsoy, the first
Garrison Towne of the States, where we were stayed,
and our Ship searched what wee carried, but at our

putting off, they gave us two Pieces of Ordnance; so
from thence along by Rhineberg, against which there
lay a man of Warre of the States, who saluted us with
three Pieces; then by Buricksweasell, and a league further
we cast anchor in the middle of the Rhyne, sayling
this day but 4. leagues and a halfe, by reason of our
stay at severall Toll places.
         The next day earely in the morning, set sayle, and
sayled downe by Rhees, Emmericke, and by Schenck-Schants,
which is now new built and well fortified againe,
where wee left the Rhyne and that on our right
hand, and went downe in a deepe River called the
Wall, by Nimmegen a faire Towne, seated on the East
side of the Rhyne on a hanging Hill, where the Governour
of the Towne, Sonne to one of the States,
came forth and tendered his service to his Excellence.
In which Towne there dyed this Summer 12000.
people of the Plague, but now thankes be to God, it
is almost ceased: from thence, passing by severall
Redoubt-Houses built at every halfe league, in which
there lyeth a Watch continually to keepe the River,
passing along untill wee came to the fourth House;
where, for all wee told them it was an English Ambassador,
shot foure or five Pieces at us, and mist some of
us very narrowly; whereupon wee cast anchor, and
lay in the middle of the Rhyne, but could not certainly
learne who they were, sayling this day seaven
leagues.
         December the 8. in the morning, wee set sayle and
went to Teill,Teill. being but two leagues, and could not
passe any further for yee, but sayled in great danger

thither of splitting our Ship by the violent force of
it, which caused us to stay there three dayes, untill we
heard there might be a passage cut over the Rhyne at
Viana; departed thither upon little Sledges, on Sunday
the eleventh of December, and passed over great
quantities of yce, through Burem, where the Prince of
Orange hath a faire Castle, thence to Culenburg, and
so to Viana to Bed, travelling with much labour
some on foot, others by the sledges this day 6. leagues,
where Sir Ferdinando Curie, an English Gentleman,
entertained his Excellence that night, the Towne is very
pleasantly seated upon the East side of the Rhyne,
and the rest thinges in it, are Flowers, for there was
a Tulip-roote sold lately for 340. pounds, as Sir Ferdinando
informed his Excellence.
         The next morning, wee tooke Boate and crossed over
the River though with much danger and difficulty
in the wet, the winde and tyde contrary, being got ashorm,
went to Vtrecht where we lay that night, which
was but 2. leagues, and where there then dyed of the
Plague 80. a weeke, but a little before 300; from
the  to Leydon next day to Bed, travelling very late,
and ght leagues this day; where some of the Princes
the Queene of Bohemia's Sonnes, were at Schoole,
whom his Excellence presently visited, and there met
with some Gentlemen, which the Queene had sent to
meet his Excellence, and two of her Coaches to fetch
him to the Hague.
         The next day before his Excell went away, he viewed
the chiefe things of note in the Towne, as the Vniversities,
the Anatomie Schoole, which before we had

not leysure to see, and from thence after dinner to the
Hague, which was but 3. leagues, being Wednesday
the 14th. day of December, and their Christmas Eve.
         Thus leaving his Excellence at the Hague, I went
for Amsterdam that famous Citie,Amsterdam first by Waggon
to Harlem, which was five leagues, where I lay that
night, being a very well built Towne, the next day
to the Citie it selfe, which was three leagues, passing
all the way upon a Cawsey, by Harlem-Meare on my
right hand, and the River Tey on the left, and entred
in at Harlem-Port, and past through all the new
Towne, and over three large Graufts, Princes, Keasers,
and the Heares Grauft, these Streets be three Quarters
of an English mile in length, two hundreth paces in
bredth, having an even row of stately beautifull Buildings,
and Trees planted the whole length of the
Graufts side, and so into the old Towne, which is not
of so stately a building, but the whole Citie is built
upon Piles in the water, and a great Channell runneth
through every Street for the Marchants ships to sayle
to their doores, their Exchange is built much like
unto that in London, both beneath and above, but that
it wants a little in breadth, with water running under
it, there is a very large building called the Weishouse,
wherein all poore Children, Fatherlesse, or of decayed
Parents, are there maintained and brought up, and
there is now at this present time 800. all clad alike,
the one side of their garments Blacke and the other
Red; there is likewise foure Hospitals adjoyning one
unto another, for Men and Women to be severed each
from other, the East and West Indian Houses, two

rare Builings and curious within, and many other
delightfull things to please the eye, heere I stayed
two dayes; and on Saturday the 17. day of December,
at 5. of the clocke at night, tooke a Sutz drawne by
a Horse, and went up a River along by the side of the
Cawsey; than I passed downe on before to Harlem,
and there at 10. of the clocke in the Evening tooke a
Waggon, and travailed all night to the Hague, which
was five leagues; but ferried over the Rhyne at two
in the morning, and got thither by 8. of the clocke;
where wee stayed Eight dayes,Hague. and the most part of
the time was spent at the Queenes Court, and the rest
in visites, betweene the Prince of Orange, the States,
and three Ambassadors which were there; as Monsieur
Charnesse from France, Seignior Carmerarius
for the Swedes, the Venetian Ambassador, and the
Count of Culenburg; but hearing our Ship was come,
his Excellence tooke leave of the Queene at 10. of the
clocke at night, and came away next morning being
Wednesday, the one and twentieth of December, and
Prince Maurice along with him to Keswicke, where
the Prince of Orange hath a House, which his Excellence
viewed, and then the Prince taking leave returned
backe againe, and his Excellence rode on forward
in her Majesties Coach to Delft where he dined,
in which Towne there are as many Bridges as Dayes
in the yeare, and so many Channels and Streets, where
Boates doe passe up and downe, and one common
Passage under a Church-yard, under which wee did
passe, from thence by a Scute to Rotterdam, where we
lay, which is from the Hague five leagues, untill that the

winde served us, and then on Saturday being the 24. of
December (and Christmas Eve by our stile) at a 11. of
the clocke in the night, tooke Boates and went to our
Ship, sayling first through Magan Sluce to Helver-Sluce,
where our Ship called the Garland did ride at
anchor, and about 3. in the afternoone set sayle, and
sayled over the Barre, having a Pilate sayling before
us with a Lanthorne on the top of his Mast, sounding
for the depth all the way; and the next day at twelue
of the clocke cast Anchor in the Dounes, and there rid
and could not land for the roughnesse of the Sea, untill
Tuesday morning the 27. of December, and then
landed at Deale, and from thence by Poast to Canterbury,
and so to Sittinburne to bed.
         The next day in the morning earely to Gravesend,
and there tooke water for London; where on the way,
my Right Honourable Lady met his Excellence, who
