         TO MY
READERS
Howsoever Qualified.
         
            Gentlemen,
         
         DEdicatory leaves to a
Book, like a Curtaine
before a picture, only
beget some higher
expectation of the Piece; A
weather beaten Traveller needs
no such Ʋmbrilla as a Patron to
shroud under. Though this Booke
was not writ to bee Printed, yet
the worst (infallibly) are printed
to be read. My intention was to
confine this wanderer to my Closet
and no farther; till the advice
of some familiar, and command

of Superiour Friends prest mee to
exchange a single Manuscript
for more Numerous Prints. I can
challenge no other inducement
then that I expose some Novelties
which I question not but this
age will disgest. For the cutts
I have hither transported, interpret
me not so much desirous
to grace the Page, as to preserve
Antiquity. My choyce consisting
of those things I never before
saw publisht. I Speake plurally
through my whole Transcursion,
because that particle (wee) implyes
asseveration, or in Reference
to Gentlemen my fellow
Travellers, who can affirme what
I relate. Some (though strange
yet no Contradiction) have seene
this Booke before the Authour
pend it; to those my sentence is
referd: such as looke into forraine
parts through the spectacles

of Imagination only, have no Patent
either to Justify or condemne
me, to these therefore may I appeare
a Romance, to the others a
Reall story.

            May it please Your Highnesse,
         
         TIs humbly conceiu'd
the duty of all the
youth of ENGLAND to

dedicate themselves and
their endeavours to your
HIGHNESSE: not
onely in regard of your
Native but Acquired
Greatnesse, which
drawes the eyes of all
Good Men upon Your
HIGHNESSE Person
and Actions. This Sir
makes mee humbly beg
leave to lay my first
fruits at Your HIGHNESSE

         A LETTER
from a most ingenious
Freind, to whom the
Authour sent His
Mercurio Italico.
         
            SIR,
         
         I Returne your
Papers by that
hand which
brought them:
I have runne swiftly over

your Itinerary, but am not
so impudent to pronounce
my thoughts on
it; unlesse I had more
time or a steaddier Brain;
for after my riding
three dayes poast I am fitter
for sleep then Epistles.
The thing most observable
of all your Travells
is your selfe, who are able
to graspe so much of the
World, when 'tis not
twice ten yeares since you
came into it. I conceive
it flowes from your good
nature, thus to set markes
on your severall Stages,
that the Prints are visible

to your freinds and
Country: 'Twas usefully
done, since now so many
of us are doom'd to
wander, not like Cain
for drawing blood, but for
asking Peace. Did others
follow your example,
this unhabitable-VVorld
would have more Manners
and lesse News. Many
Itineraries I have seene in
Latine, few in English,
and those so partiall, that
Countries are describ'd
(as Committees do Gentlemen)
not as they are,
but as they would have
them. 'Tis a Noble Meditation

how Greece and
Italy (two great Champions)
looke over the
Water, Daring and
threatning and watching
each other; 'twas once so
'twixt France and England.
Such as have seen them
will say how exactly
you shew us Rome, Venice,
Florence, Naples,
Milan, Genua, Bolonia,
Padua, and those other
Glories beyond the Alpes:
to me this great limbe of
the World (Italy you
know is a leg) not your
foot but your hand hath
gone over as a brief, elegant,

smart Anatomist.
But I am sorry you mention
Virgils Tombe, for
now people will thinke
hee is mortall; sure his
owne Pile (built three
stories high, of Eclogues,
Georgicks, and
Aeneads) will last as long
as the round World. In
this Journey others went
before you, so as you
are forc'd almost upon
gleanings, yet here (as
in the Field) gleanings
put togeather are the best
of the Corne. Now you
are come home, you'l
have stranger sights then

any abroad; you'l see
Great Brittaine a Floating
Island, and the most vertuous
Monarch under
Heaven cast into a small
Isle as on some plank in
a great Ship-wrack. You'l
find London (like the
Spleen in the Body) hath
rendred other Parts poore
and languid; so as now
England is but one great
Towne; this London all
sides do court and hate,
and shee is so much cocknay
to thinke it will continue,
having kickt at
all, and made no freind.
Sir, when you behold

a Kingdome without a
King, a Church without
Clergy, a University
without Scholars,
you'l grant wee have
a thorough Reformation.
But two houres since I
saw a better sight then
Italy affords; 'tis His
Highnesse the Prince of
Wales, who for Soule and
Body is sure the most
hopefull Prince in the
Christian World; whose
comming hether this afternoone
brings a floud of
businesse (as well as joy)
on all the English in this
Towne, especially on such

as come for Dispatches;
and that's the very reason
why now you must excuse,
         
            Sir,
            Amiens Iul: 11.
Stilo novo 1648.
            
            Your most affectionate
humble Servant.

         On his Friends Mercurio Italico.
         GOe with your Hellish Heliconish spells,
         Raise puffpast, kneade unleav'ned sillables,
         Expatiate on a page in Tiptoe sence
         To pacifie the witts concupisence
         Make Cupid dance o'th Ropes; O! this is sport
         Will drill the Tenements of the — — —
         Planetick Nntio tell him that peepes here
         Tyber and Thames concorporate this yeare.
         Minnums, leave Padling in your feeble Geare.
         Marke how the lusty Gray Beards hugg each other
         Their Elementall sobbs the consort smother.
         These to their Native Beds Retreate; But see
         Antiquity swadled in a Novelty.
         Yet no Booth Progeny to be Gaz'd on Guest,
         Nor Loud ones with the Mandeville posest;
         Rare, not miraculous Blusterers that can
         Preach up the Booke but chatechise the Man.
         
         What thoughƲesuuius Hells Centinell that Champion stout,
         Spit wildfire, Blow the Dayes Taper out?
         Or those insultingthe Alpes Gogmagogs rehearse
         But pimples in the Corpulent Vniverse;
         All's safe: Begin thy Voyage Reader, trye;
         Delay will Annalize a Diary.
         
            Travells goe twice abroad, both merit Praise;
            First they drive dayes to yeares, then yeares to dayes.
         
         
            J. N.
         
      
      
         
         An Introduction to
ITALY.
         IT is preeminence
enough methinkes
for Italy that shee
did then sway the
Allcoercive Scepter
on Earth, when our Redeemer
assum'd the flesh. To her
we owe our Civility; shee purchast
it by conquests in the Levant;
Propogated it by Victories
in the North, till dispairing
of a Farther Plantation the
Picts wall was her Vltima Thule;
perhaps least that people should
have stumbled at the Innovation.
         
            
To bee Retrograde on this
subject were to rob History of
her birthright, to insist on my
owne ocular observation but
veniall vsury.
         There are three evitable dangers
that divert some from this
Voyage; the first is the heates
of the Climate; A second, that
horrible (in Report) Inquisition;
the last, Hazard of those
mercilesse Out Lawes Banditas.
         The first may bee allayd by
Moderation, the second prevented
by discretion; the last avoided
by the defence of those
states you passe through.
         This Duke of florence quite
extirpated that savage Race
out of his Dominions by raising
a competent number; that personated
Robbers and joynd in
league with the reall ones till
they fouud opportunity to dispatch
them.
         
            
As there is connivance at the
Luterani (for so they terme us)
so tis rashnesse to proclaime
ones opinion, weakenesse to
disclose it: This may gaine the
Odium of the Better, this the
injuries of the Vulgar.
         A novice of late so soone as
he was come to Florence, said,
Methinks this place is somewhat
popishly affected.
         Another with more pardonable
ignorance when his Host
askt him whether he was walking
in the Afternoone, replyd,
to Masse.
         One of my Cotemporaries
discoursing with a Fryar, in a
Complemēt protested he did reverence
Clergy men for that he
was the sonne of a Priest in England:
which the Monke could
not conster but either an Irony
to his Order, or Infamous to the

Gentlemans owne descent.
         The most cautious tongue is
incident to these Errours; yet
that nation is not so scrupulous
as to take notice of a strangers
words or actions unlesse openly
scandalous; for as Heretico is a
name utterly detestable, so
Tramontano by the Multitude is
held contemptible, which low
reputation begets a happy
privacy to the Reserv'd Forreigner.
         That sort of People which
Travellers have most agitation
with as Vetturino's Hosts & the
like, are very peremptory and
crosse, which if you menace
they wil repaire with double insolence;
knowing that if in the
contest their Stilletto should do
mischiefe, the next Church may
be their Asylum, where no Law
or violence can attempt them.
         
            
The safest way is Dissimulation,
and to winne better Accommodation
amongst them
disparage not, rather commend
the worst.
         Their Osterias or Innes stand
usually alone, remote from any
Village, so that Passengers must
bee content with what those
Tabernae can afford, and he that
seemes to dislike their feeble
A weak Broath of Hearbs Minestra perhaps shall have
nothing but anGood words. Allegramente
for amends.
         This Inference I lay hold on
to speake more amply of the Italian.
         Whilst Rome wore the Imperiall
Diadem of the subdued
World, it might have been a disputable
Criticisme, whither
Rome stood in Italy; or Italy in
Rome, That voice of fame
which attributed all to the Roman;

derogated from the Renowne
of the Italian: Now,
since Rome did resigne the
Crowne to the Miter; Italy allowes
her no Supremacy, but
Ecclesiasticall; and in the generall
voge tis the most proper
phrase to say such a man is an
Italian, though a Native of
Rome.
         However, in the Survey of
this present Generation I finde a
residue of the old Genius still
surviving.
         That Roman Generosity yet
runnes in the bloud of their Noble
Families, which (I have
heard) can draw their Pedigree
from the great Masters of the
World; as that of the Savelli
from Scipio Africanus.
         Neither doth the height of
their spirits argue lesse.
         The Neopolitan is so elevated

with his imaginary Revennewes that in his deepest poverty
hee will speake thousands
rather then betray his
wants.
         One will sit gravely before
his doore picking his teeth, and
condemne the Capon hee eate
last; when a morsell of Bread
would passe downe merrily.
         Another I have seen begging
in this method: first he lookes
about to see whether the Coast
be cleare, before hee will utter
one suppliant word; then hee
approaches in a more submisse
straine, yet if any one chance
to cast an eye that way; he retreates
to familiarity; Pressing
the justnesse of his Demands
till hee obtaines the almes;
which if but a penny or so, hee
casts it contemptibly in the Donours

face, but soone after
peaceably searches for the money,
and when tis found prayes
for the Benefactour.
         This is consonant with the
Spaniard, so is the Genuesian as
lofty as his buildings, so proud
in his Garbe, that at our first
nights Supper in Genua, some
Fidlars came to welcome us
with their Musick, but with so
grave and stately a Preamble,
that wee all withdrew from
our seats to salute the men, imagining
them no lesse then Magistrates.
         The Plebeians or Commonalty
of Italy savour much of
the Goths and Vandalls; yet even
these are frequently distinguisht
with the worthy Appellations
of Julio, Flaminio, Fabio,
&c.
         In the Campagna di Roma I

once espyde a Labourer tilling
the ground neer some decayed
Monuments; whereupon I
made towards the fellow and
askt him what those Ruines
were; Hee answered mee, hee
knew nothing; but he had often
heard his Grandfather tell a
Story of one Signor Romolo,
that fought there. A twinckling
Tradition and implies
much.
         They have a Recreation certainly
deriv'd from their Ancestours,
viz: La Mora, anciently
micare Digitis, at the first
it appeares but childishly ridiculous;
after better acquaintance,
a kinde of Conjuration;
Tis of force to binde the Fancy;
yet the most illiterate are
best at the Game.
         And no wonder since this
Ayre hath from all Ages checherisht

the strongest Atlase's
for Invention and Art.
         What Braine but Italian
could contrive Engines to raise
so vast a Moles as the Vatican
Obelisque.
         Observe what machivillian
unheard of Weapons they devise
to surprize an enemy unawares.
         At Venice I saw a pocket
Church Booke with a Pistoll
hid in the binding, which turning
to such a Page, discharges.
A plot (I conceive) to entrap
him you hate, whilst yon are at
your devotions together, when
there's least suspition.
         Another as rare, is a Pocket
stone-Bow, which held under
a Cloake shoots needles with
violence to pierce a mans body,
yet leaves a wound scarce discernable.
         
            
A third is a walking staffe
in appearance; at the top is a
Spring which graspt hard, at
the other end will jet forth a
Rapier with force enough to
kill at a yards distance.
         A fourth is a Gunne to bee
charg'd with winde, which for
six paces will not faile of execution
with a small or no report.
         To these I may adde their
curious (yet Illegall) tricks
in poyson, some mortall by
smelling to, others that given
now, shall have no operation
till many moneths after.
         Some will attempt to poyson
Rivers if they can but finde
the Source or Fountaine; and
in Milan there stands a Pillar
cald Colonna Infame, rais'd
where a Magicians house was
puld downe, who for a time

poysond the whole City.
         I omit not their excellency in
Statuary, Limming, Architecture,
Gardning, Sceanes, Musick,
in which all Europe gives
them the precedency.
         In what perfection they have
these faculties you may conclude
from these Instances.
         Upon a Sepulcher in S. Peters at
Rome, in a Combent posture lie
the feminine Statues of Old age,
and of Youth; In the latter the
Sculpturer hath so exceeded
Nature, for Limbes, Features
and Comelinesse, that tis said
a Spaniard at his Beads left his
Devotions to expiate his sense
on that Niobe-like Lady, and
for that reason a vaile of black
Marble now covers Youths nakednesse;
whilst her neighbour
old Age wants a Smock.
         For limming, one Mattia

Casale of Sienna (though no
eminent Artist) drew the Picture
of a Prince so exactly, and
with that vivacity, that in the
Princes eyes, hee plac't his own
Effigies perfectly discernable as
in the Originall.
         Sir Henry Wotton a friend
to Ingenuity, and a great admirer
of it in the Italian, had
transported out of Italy a
Piece of two Dogs combating
for a bone, done with that
life; that a third more living
Curre entring into the Roome,
very eagerly assaulted the Colours,
which wanted nothing
but motion, to resist him.
         For their Architecture I referre
you to their Cities; A
Flandrian Embassadour leaving
Florence, told the Great
Duke his City deserv'd to bee
seen never but on Holy-dayes.
         
            
For their Gardens, I dare
considently avow all Christendome
affords none so voluptuous,
as those within the
Walls and Territory of Rome;
and at Bagnaia (as I remember)
there's a Walke for a hundred
paces archt with Fountaines,
so that a man may passe
drye under the Element of
water; A trick might raise a
Question in the Schooles.
         Their Sceanes, (or as they
terme them Operas) are Regalios,
they have not yet fully
communicated to us, their other
Arts wee daily borrow.
         A yeare since in a Representation
at Venice, Phaeton in his
Charriot drawne by foure Naturall
well pamperd Steeds,
were all hurld over the Theater
in an Artificiall cloud.
         
            
In this they but imitate Nature,
marke how they subdue
her.
         At the Marriage of the Duke
of Florence there was brought
on the Stage a Balletta, or
dance of Horses; whilst an
Ape playde the ayre on a Gittarre;
A Florentin said a third
Miracle was intended, Viz:
a Consort of Parachitos voices,
but the Schollars had not got
their lesson perfect against the
day appointed for the Nuptialls.
         They are so addicted to
Musick, especially that of the
Voyce, (which indisputably
is the best,) that great Persons
keep their Castrati, viz.
Eunuch's whose throates and
complexions scandalize their
breeches.
         Neither is the Rout lesse

propense to that though with
lesser skill and art;A Porter. There's
no Fachin or Cobler but can
finger some Instrument; so
that when the heats of the
Day are tyr'd out to a coole
Evening; the Streets resound
with confused, yet pleasant
Notes.
         Their Carnavall is the fitest
Season to vent any humours;
Hee's most extold
that can act the Mimick best:
So many men, so many Crochets;
some abusive, others for
Mirth.
         A Sanesian perhaps to satyrize
on the French Vanity,
got on a Sute a la Mode
with all things correspondent;
but for his trimming,
where wee place Gold Buttons
(as downe the Breeches.
Round the knees, along the

skirts &c.) he wore little Hobby
Horse Bells, and on his
Crest stood a Cocks combe
Triumphant; Thus whilst he
footed it gingerly through
the streets, the spectators
voushsaft him no other Title
then Monsieur.
         From these passages I have
here cited the Reader may collect
of what temper this people
is, by these following what that
of the Country.
         Southern climates (Philosophically)
refine the braine; those
that have adorn'd Italy with
their singular endowments,
owe perhaps as much to their
Countrey, as she to them.
         Yet most certainely had Romulus
his Successours aspird no
farther then the Mud wall hee
left them; had those Legions
of Worthies never beene borne

there, wee should never have
had such an esteeme of this Cisalpine
clod; the fertility of
which I attribute not to the
Soyle, but Site.
         The Earth yealdes these five
Harvests successively; First, in
June, that of Silke; in July, of
diverse fruits; in August, that
of Corne, which they afterwards
sow with Millio, Rice,
Turkie Wheate, or the like
graine, and within two moneths
have another croppe.
         In September that of their
wines.
         In October, that of Oyle.
         Most of those places celebrated
by the old Poets for the rich
gifts of Bacchus are degenerated
from their pristine worth, yet
in lieu of those, others are so
enobled, that in a Moderate
computation they have no lesse

then twenty distinct Species of
Liquor to please the Gusto; the
most dilicious, (and but the Ethnick
Ambrosia in a Christian
Phrase) they call Lachrymae
Christi.
         They have few trees but
what wee have seene in these
parts.
         The Hesperian Apple, or
Orange Tree is of a most ravishing
beauty perpetually Verdant,
bearing an Hortyard of
Blossoms, greene and ripe
Fruite altogether.
         Amongst their Medicinall
Plants scarce knowne amongst
us but in Apothicaries shoppes;
I tooke notice of one Odoriferous
Hearbe called Basilico,
which hath this innate power,
that if laid under a stone in
some moyst place, in two dayes
it produceth a Scorpion, this I

can assert by experience, and to
countenance this story, there
fell out a strange accident in my
stay at Siena. A Gentleman was
so pleas'd with the smell of this
Basilico, that he had some dry'd
and beaten into powder, which
he snuft up, imagining it of the
same force with Tobacco to
cleare the head, but hee bought
the experience at the price of
his life, for hee dyed distracted;
His skull being afterwards opened
by the Chyrurgion, a nest
of Scorpions were found feeding
on his Braine.
         For their creatures they have
many not known to this Island,
but for curiosity. About
Rome they plow the land with
Buffolos; neere Sienna they
hunt the wild Boare, with the
Rowbuck, the Wolfe, the Porcupine,
and the Tasso Cane or
Mountaine Dog.
         
            
They have many Reptilias,
of strange natures.
         The Cimici are most Troublesome
bed fellowes; but Fleas
in Folio, yet so dainty, as they
will chuse their flesh; my
Chamberfellowes face hath
lookt bigge as Boreas with them
in one night, when they have
not so much as toucht my skin,
or disturbd my sleepe. They
are very offensive to his nostrills
that destroyes them.
         The Cantherides are greene
flyes by day, and in the night
passe about the fields (a pleasing
spectacle) like flying
Glowormes with fire in their
Tayles.
         A Rimarra is a Philanthropall
creature in forme like a
Lyzzard, in bignesse much exceeding
it. A Countryman told
mee nature had so provided

that the property of that beast
was thus; If a Peasent lay to
repose himselfe in the shade,
The Rimarra will vigilantly
attend him, if a Serpent approach
(with which she is at
enmity) shee tickles the Countryman
in the eare; summoning
him to stand on his
guard.
         No lesse strange though true
is the report of the Tarantula
which some say is a Flye; but
at the opening of a doore in the
Ʋatican their skipt out a creature

         AN
ITENIRARY
CONTAINING
A breife Narration of a
Voyage made through Italy, in
the yeare 1646. and 1647.
         THere are but two ordinary
passages out of
France into Italy, the
one over the Alpes, the other by
the Mediterranean Sea, those
commonly which goe by the
first, returne by the second, and
so contrary. We (November being
quite expired ere we left
France) for our owne convenience
preferred a boate before

a horse, I meane the Sea voyage,
before the Land. Wherefore
being come to Antibe the
utmost City of France, wee
found favour of the Governour
(it being a Frontiere and place
of strength) in giving us a Bill
of health, without which it is
very difficult to enter into any
of the Italian States or Cities, &
having over night procured a
Filoaco to carry us all our way
to Genua if so be wee mett with
no Boate of returne betwixt
thence and Monaco; the next
morning we departed, and about
nine in the forenoone
came before Nice in Savoy, situated
on the Sea side, but hath
no Port, the buildings are after
the Italian, & it is commanded
by a strong Castle that stands
on a hill. Finding no convenience
of imbarquing better here

we sayled on, but at the point
of Land that turnes towards
Morgues, there arose a contrary
winde, which forc't us to retyre
into the next harbour, to
wit Villa Franca (aunciently
called Portus Herculis) where
by permissiō of the Governour
of the Citadell we lay that
night. This place likewise belongs
to the Duke of Savoy. The
next day going out of the Haven
we met with a Genova Filouco,
& having agreed for our
passage in that, quitted our former,
yet no sooner were we in
the boat but a Tempest drove
us againe into the harbour; so
that we lost that day entirely.
The day following we had both
faire weather, & a calme Sea,
which encourag'd our watermen
to adventure out; about 2.
miles from Ʋilla Franca we dis-

a great vessell making towards
us, which our Boatmen seemed
to feare taking it, for a Turkish
man of War, but we were afterwards
informed to the cōtrary.
A little further we strooke into
the Port of Monaco, and after
an houre or two stay there, the
wind growing contrary, our
Boatmen wisht us to tarry longer
least wee should be exposed
to a greater inconvenience,
which wee the more willingly
condiscended too, in regard, tis
so remarkable a place as no
stranger can well passe without
especiall observation thereof;
for I must confesse I know no
so small a principality of the
like consideration, either for
strength or riches; The Prince
of the family of the Grimaldi
of Genua, is in his state soveraine,
and coynes mony, but

hath still some greater King for
his Protector, of late yeares hee
left the Spanish party, and gave
himselfe with this his cheife
Towne, to the King of France's
tuition, so that at our arrive
there, there was a strict garison
of French; the Marquis of Corbon
being then Governour to
whom wee had addresse from
his Brother in Law at Antibe,
us'd us very civilly, and sent a
souldier with us; to shew us all
the rarityes that are there to
be seene.
         Monaco (whether I may properly
call it a Town or Castle I
know not) is situated on the top
of a rockey Promontory of incredible
hard accesse,Monaco. inviron'd
with strong walls, within which
are some streets very neately
representing the face of a
City, in the middest is a spacious

court fit for to exercise military
discipline in, at the end
is the Princes Palace, which
though Beautifull on the outside
yet contains greater wealth
within, cheifly in his Gardrobe,
where the variety of Tapistries
the great quantity of plate, with
the vastnesse of vessels, as
Fountaines, Tables, and such
like of pure silver, striks amazement
into him that sees it,
besides this rich furniture, there
are two Cabinets or Galeries of
rare curiosities which excepting
the Duke of Florences,
may be equaled with most of
that nature in Italy: amongst
other singularities I was much
taken with the statue of an Indian
of Porphyre, and other
materiall, as likewise a gemmery
compil'd of severall pretious
stones with these letters;

Otium Francisci Bembi; The
Prince was then in enlarging
this Palace, and beautifying it
with Marbles and waterworks.
Having with great satisfaction
seene all the particularities of
this place, we returned downe
to our Inne, and it growing towards
night, some few howers
before our departure a hard accident
befell us, which was the
losse of our Bill of health,
wherefore though it was darke
and the watch was set, yet wee
sent up a letter by a string to
the Governour, who very
courteously returned us a
Ticket of larger extent then
our former. At midnight wee
departed from Monaco past
eight miles farther by Menton,
a village belonging to the same
Prince, and about breake of
day we came before Vintimiglia

the first city (towards France)
of the Republique of Genua,
from hence we were in view of
the mountaines of Corsica and
foure miles farther we past by
Saint Remes, where the shore
(which is called by the name
of the rive of Genua) is all covered
with Orange, Citron, and
Date Trees. Past the rest of
that day without seeing any
thing remarkable, unlesse Porto
Mauritio, where heretofore
there was a very good Port
which the Genuesians ruin'd,
fearing it should bring prejudice
to their owne. Towards
night we strooke in at Oneille,
a city which seemes to interrupt
the Genois dominions,
and belongs to the Duke of
Savoy. After we had supt wee
tooke boate and sayled all
night by many Townes, viz.

Diano, Araisse, where they fish
for Corall, Albengue, Luan, a
city of the Prince of Oria a Genois,
Final a place of strength
and the only garrison the King
of Spaine hath in these coasts;
the Port though small yet
serves much in the conveyance
of men and amunition towards
Milan. This place commonly
pillageth strangers, they taking
all for Frenchmen; but (praysed
be God) wee past quietly,
and towards breake of day
came before Savona; The most
ancient and greatest city of the
Genevoisat after Genua it selfe.
Behind this city, the Apennines
that cleave Italy in sunder begin
to take their rise. From
hence to Genua is 35. Italian
miles; all which way one goes
more and more into the pleasantnesse
of Italy, the whole

board being fild with Country
Seats and Villages, which for
beauty surpasse many cities I
have seene elsewhere. Amongst
those San Pietro d' Arania (whither
the richer Genuesians retire
themselves in the sommer,
and indeed may bee call'd another
Genua for the gallantry of
the buildings) is the best; but
three miles distant from Genua,
the Metropolis of that most
flourishing Republick, which
contains so stately Palaces, that
from all the rest of Italy, it hath
gotten the name of Genua the
superbe.
         Tis situated at the foot of
very high mountaines,Genua. which
though sterile, yet want nothing
that Art can enrich
them with; In gardens, waterworkes,
and the like. That
which exceeds all the rest, is

the Prince of Orias Palace, reaching
from the bottome of the
shoare, to the top of the mountaines,
divided into three gardens.
In the first whereof the
Terrasses or Porches one above
another bore up with
marble Pillars, is very magnificent,
as likewise the Fountaine
of the Eagles, and the
Family of Neptune: at the one
side that famous Cage of ironworke,
which is of so vast an
extent that it encloseth a wood
of Cypresse and other trees.
The other two are fild with
Grottes, Orange trees; and other
variety of delights: At the
upper part of all stands the statue
of Jupiter tonant. Within
the Pallace the Gardrobe full
of rarietyes; the Tapestries and
precious Furuiture declare
greatly the richnesse of that
Prince.
         
            
Next to this is the house of
Hieronimo del Negro, where the
excellent Pictures, the fall of
waters, the Fountain, the Piscina,
the Grove and other delightfull
departments, are well
worth seeing. On all sides of the
City is an infinity of such places
of pleasure, especially round about
the Port, which is of a
large circuit, resembling much
the forme of a Theatre enclos'd
with faire buildings.
Tis defended by a solid Bulwarke
(which they call Il
Mole) that lyes about 2 hundred
paces into the Sea, rais'd
at a very great expence: Opposite
to that a rocky Promontory
casts it selfe forth, at
the head whereof stands a very
lofty Pharos, bearing a lanterne
of more then an ordinary
bignesse, to guide Ships in

the night: Within the Haven
is a place where the Gallyes
lay, every one in a particular
Classis. As for the City it selfe,
it is enough to say the Genuesians
live in a Kingly luxury,
and I believe it is the best
built and compacted City, not
onely of Italy, but also of Europe.
The houses generally
are very high, the streets
for the most part (its onely
fault) are somewhat narow,
so that no Coaches are here
admitted, which though an
inconvenience, yet preserves
the wayes more cleane and
neater. I except here that spacious,
long, even, and indeed
Mistris of streets the Strada
Nova, which I am confident
may be justly preferd before
any in Christendome, so proud
in Architecture, so rich in Marbles

are the Palaces tis fild
with. The fairest one belongs
to the Duke of Oria. Amongst
the publick Edifices, the Exchange
or Merchants Hall.
the Dukes Palace with the Armory
for 30 thousand men deserv'd
our walking to. Neither
are the Genuesians lesse splendid,
in adorning their Consecrated
places; witnesse the
mighty quantity of polish't
Marble, wherewith all the
Churches are fild, especially
San Lorenzo the Dome, and
Santo Ambrosio belonging to
the Jesuites. But that which
surpasseth all, and is of most
admiration, is the Chappell of
the Anunciade, begun to bee
built not many yeares since at
the expence of one Family,
(whose Palace joynes to it)
yet is of so incredible richnesse

for the red and white Marble
Pillars, and other ornaments,
that one would imagine the
revenues of a whole City could
not bee enough to raise so glorious
a Worke as that will be
when tis finisht. Finally, the
Genuesians to defend this their
brave City, have encompast it
with Walls no lesse commendable
for beauty and strength,
then prodigious for their large
extent. The people of this
Common-wealth are habited
all alike, somewhat tending towards
the Spanish Mode; and
are of a very austere and superbe
humour, hardly vouchsafing
to look so low as a stranger,
wherefore having with
much satisfaction seene their
Flourishing Estate, wee left
them. We set out from Genua
in a Filouca about Sun-setting,

and having sayld all that
night, about noone the next
day we strooke into Porto Venere,
and after dinner crost the
Golfe of Aspecia, (which is defended
with many strong Fortifications)
to Lerizi. This
Bourg being the mid way from
Genua to Ligourne (such is the
villany of the watermen in
these parts) if they get their
passengers, chiefly strangers hither,
they will so delay their
departure, pretending the inconveniences
of the weather,
that by lying still at so great an
expence, they may bee forc'd
to give them their pay, and
to hire horses for the rest of
the way by Land. Which trick
wee were forc't to suffer patiently,
after a day and halfes attendance
for our boat. Hence
we tooke Post, and having past

through the Olive woods, over
the hills that lay neerest the
shoare, wee came into a low
plaine Countrey, which continued
so to Ligorne. First we
past the River Magre, then
went by Sarazana, a good City,
and last of the dominion of
Genua, after that we came into
the Principality of Massa, wherin
we past by Lavenza and Carrara,
where out of the hills
they dig great store of Marble,
and then through Massa it selfe,
where the Prince resides in Estate
Soveraigne.
         The Towne is very pleasant,
standing in a Territorie
fruitfull in Orange trees and
other fruits. Hence wee came
suddenly into Tuscany, but
quickly left it, falling into a
woody Country, belonging to
the State of Lucas, and so

to Viregio, under the same
power, standing at the mouth
of a small river, which runnes
from Lucques. Here we were
forc't to lye, and the next morning
some two mile farther wee
past the river that parts the Republique
of Lucques from Toscany,
and so in the morning arriv'd
at Pisa.Pisa.
         
         Which City was heretofore
a great free state of it
selfe, but at the rising of the family
of the Medicis on which
line the Dukes of Etruria successively
runne, this with many
other noble cities, was reduced
to the great Dukes subjection.
From whom it hath received
many Embellisments. Tis situated
in a Marshy land, so that
the unholesomnesse of the aire
renders it scarce of the native
people, much more of strangers

which seldome tarry any
longer then to see the rarities of
the place. Amongst which I
preferre that worthy peece of
arte the Falling Tower which
travellers boast of, (and not undeservedly)
as one of the most
mervellous things they see in
the voyage of Italy. Tis cover'd
round with galleries & 7. rowes
one above another of Marble
Pillars, so that 'tis hard to bee
imagin'd by what engines so
great a structure should be supported,
it being built so declining
to one side, that all men
which regard it, at the first expect
its fall. Hard by is the Dome
or Cathedrall Church of Pisa;
where threescore Pillars
testifie as well its Antiquity,
as the Gates of Brasse its rarity.
Joyning to this is the Campo
Santo, or Cimetiere firm'd in

with a wall of Marble, and
much resembles a Cloyster; in
the midst is the Church yard
from whence the place hath its
denomination, that implies the
holy Field; because halfe the
ground was brought from Jerusalem,
and it hath a particular
propriety, that all bodies
which are buried there, are
consum'd within the space of
40. houres. Here are likewise
reserv'd many Ancient Urnes,
which, with the story of the
Old and New Testament painted
of old worke, make the
place very venerable. Hard by
is the Baptistary, or San Giovanni;
wherein, the Font,
and pulpit leaning on foure
Lyons, will for the preciousnesse
of the stone, yield to no
other in Italie. Leaving the
Area where these things stand

together, a little more into the
towne is the Chappell and Palace,
of the Knights of the Order
of St. Stephen, the Frontespiece
of the Chappell is of
Marble neatly pollish't. The
inside is adorn'd with the truest
Ensignes of Valour; I meane
Trophees taken from the common
enemies of Christianity,
the Turkes. Before their Palace
is the statue of the great
Duke Cosmus, with a Fountain.
This Dignity of Knighthood
is much like to that of Malta,
both to maintain Christs cause
against the Mahometans, yet
these may marrie, the others
I conceive may not: These
weare a red Crosse for their
badge in this fashion. ✚ From
hence we walk't to the Physitians
garden, which is more for
use then delight; although there

be good walks, & water-works
that well washt us, yet for the
most 'tis cover'd with simples,
outlandish Plants and the like.
Joyning to it is a gallery very
commodious for Medecinall
things, it abounding with all
curiosities of Nature, as forreign
creatures, Stones, Mineralls,
and whatsoever strange
the farthest Indies produce. In
generall, this City stands so opportunely,
as few like for the
receiving of all forreign Wares.
In the midst thereof runnes the
river Arno, from thence to its
Embuschment navigable for
very great Vessels, so that here
is a place where the Duke
builds his Gallies: On one side
of the river, is a faire street cald
Longarno, where is the great
Dukes Palace, and before it the
statue of Ferdinand the third;

On the other side is the Exchange,
little, but of Marble,
then which nothing more
common in Italy. In a word,
'tis prayse enough, to say tis
the third City under the great
Duke, who I thinke hath the
fairest of what Prince soever.
Having taken a satisfactory
view hereof, we went on our
way to Ligourne, whither there
is an hourely convenience of a
Coach to transport Merchandise
from Ligorne to Pisa, the
Duke hath made an artificiall
Channell, of 15. miles long,
which bares small boates like
to Venetian Gondoloes. The
Escluse of which Channell we
saw at our setting forth out of
Pisa, cover'd for 250. paces.
The most part of the way to
Ligorne is through Fennes, till
one enters into the great Dukes

Forrest, which continues to the
towne.Ligorne.
         
         Ligorne the only maritimate
place of importance, under the
Great Duke, is situated in a
plaine, at the board of the Mediterranean
Sea, tis but little,
yet the great concurse of Merchants
which flow thither from
all Nations, chiefly from my
one, make it more spoken of
than many Cities, of a larger
extent. 'Tis an innumerable
summe of money the Duke receives
yearly from this small
Port: wherefore his Predecessors
with him have omitted nothing
to make it strong, witnesse
the royall Bastions, and
mote wherewith tis fenct; The
great Port where the Ships lay
at Anchor, is defended by the
Mole, and about hath many
fanalls. The Darcina, where

the Gallies (then but six in
number) lay as quiet as in a
Chamber, is most exquisitely
well contriv'd: Before stands
that best of moderne Statues,
the Duke Ferdinand in Marble,
and the Colosses of foure slaves
under him, in brasse in divers
Postures, so lively represented,
that if the Statuary could have
fram'd a voice as well as those
bodies, he might have conquerd
nature. Besides this
piece, there are no more curiosities
in this towne, yet many
conveniences. The streets are
generally large, the houses low,
but uniforme, unlesse some
which have been put out of order
by an Earthquake, to
which this place is often Subject.
The great place is very
beautifull, and fit for the assemblies
of Merchants. On the

houses round about and in the
fairest streets, are pictur'd all the
battels, and victories of the
great Dukes gallies, obtained
over the Turks, which a slave
did to gaine his redemption.
The Jewes which are here in
great number, have the fairest
Synagogue I ever yet saw,
wherin on a saturday their Sabbaoth,
we saw the manner of
their divine (if so I may call it)
service. Their priviledges here
are more then ordinary, they
wearing no marke of distinction
as in other Townes, so that
here the wealthier and richer
sort are of that Sect. The
Greeks likewise have a Congregation,
and Church here. In
a word, Ligorne is compacted
of forreigners, yet the unwholsomenesse
of the aire banisheth
a great part from

thence, which I by dangerous
experience found true; for the
day before I was to depart
for Florence, (having all the
while I stayed at Ligorne found
a strange alteration of the aire,
different both from that of
England and France.) I was ill
dispos'd to sicknesse, however,
not so much but that I adventur'd
on my journey, which
though with much difficulty I
perfected. The first night we lay
at Pisa, which way we had formerly
past. The next morning
we tooke Coach, (a very unpleasant
passage over hilly
way) and past first by S. Roman,
a Convent of the Observantins
standing on high, from
whence is a pleasant prospect
downe the valley, from thence
we came to Empoly, a neat little
towne where we lay, and

the next day towards noone
arrived at Florence.
         Which for its singular excellencies,Florence.
amongst all other
Cities of Italy, is cal'd 
the Faire. Florence the Capitall
of Toscany, and seat of the
great Duke, is scituated at the
bottome of very high hills, environ'd
on all sides with the
same, excepting towards the
West side, before which lies a
plaine Countrey, vulgo Pianura
di Fiorenza. This City is divided
in two by the river Arno,
over which are built foure
Bridges of stone, upon one of
the two chief is the Goldsmiths
street; upon the other of very
stately structure stand the
foure quarters of the yeare in
marble; Opposite to this before
the Trinity, stands a vast
Columne, with a statue of Justice

in Porphyre at the top,
which, Cosmus the first great
Duke rais'd as a Trophee in
that place, because the newes
there came to his eare of the
taking of Siena. Hard by, is the
Palazzo de Strozzi, no lesse to
be admir'd for the immensity
of its fabrick, then for its rude
and unusuall Architecture.
From hence towards the right
hand is the Merchants Vault,
supported with faire Pillars,
and before it a brazen Boare
jetting forth water; Keeping
right on, one comes into the
great Place, in the midst thereof
is the great Duke Cosmus, a
horse-back in brasse, with this
inscription under.
         Cosmo Medici Magno, Etruriae
Duci Primo, Pio, Felici, Invicto,
Justo, Clementi, Sacrae
Militiae, Pacisque in Etruria Authori,

DLXXXXIV. on each side of
the Basis.
         Profligatis hostibus in deditionem
acceptis Senensibus: Plenis
liberis Sen: Fl. suffragiis
Dux. Patriae renuntiatur. Behinde.
         Ob Zelam Religionis praecipuumque
Justitiae studium.
         Betwixt this horse and the
Palazzo vecchio, is a Fountaine,
which all Italy cannot shew
the like besides, round about
the Laver is the family of Neptune
in brasse, with his Colosse
of Marble in the midst,
bore up by foure horses; The
whole not possible to be equald,
much lesse excel'd by humaine
art.
         In this same Piazza, is a

Porch archt and adorn'd with
some statues, amongst which
that of Judith, in brasse with
that of the Rape of the Sabines,
three Persons in severall Postures
cut all out of one stone
are most remarkable.
         Just against it is the Palazzo
Vecchio, at the entrance stands
two Colosses, the one of David,
the other of Hercules
trampling on Cacus, the first
of Michael Angelo, which in
my judgement comes short of
the other, though he the more
famous statuary. Within is a
Court set about with Pillars of
Corinthian worke; Above is a
very spacious Hall with divers
Statues, and amongst them
those of two Popes, Leo the
tenth, and Clement the seventh,
of the family of the Medicis;
the apertenants of this lodging

are very great, and costly, but
it being not so frequented as if
the Court were kept there, every
thing looseth its luster.
         Wherefore having speedily
dispatcht the sight hereof; that
which requires a week to observe
well, is at hand: I meane
that richest of Treasures, the
great Dukes Gallery. In the
lower story sit the Courts of
Justice, with an arcade to walk
in on each side. Above are the
shops of divers Artisans which
work continually for the great
Duke. In the uppermost part
is contained as many wonders
as things, Some to be admir'd
for their preciousnesse and art,
others for their rarity and Antiquity.
On each side of the
Gallerie are ranged Statues, to
the number of fourescore and
odde, of which for Antiquity

I preferre the Idoll brought
from the temple of Apollo, at
Delphis, with this verse on the
Pedistall.
         Ʋt potui huc veni Delphis & fratre relicto.
         As likewise that of Scipio
Africanus, holding up his
Gowne under his arme, according
to Ciceros words. Nobis
quidem olim annus erat unus ad
cohibendum brachium toga constitutus,
& ut exercitatione ludoque
campestri, tunicati uteremur.
After these I may reckon
the two triumphant Pillars;
from whence they were taken
I know not; but their worke
speaks them Roman. Over the
statues hang the Pictures, some
Prototypes of the most famous
men of the moderne times, on
the one side Schollars, on the
other souldiers.
         At the right hand of this

gallerie are severall stanzas full
of curiosities, into which whosoever
enters is astonisht at the
quantity of wealth; confus'd
with the variety of things
worth observation.
         In the first Roome we went
into, stands the Tabernacle,
or altar destinated for S. Laurence
Chappell, no part thereof
of common Marble; but totally
compacted with Jewells and
Precious stones; The value
inestimable.
         In the next Chamber is a Table
with Flowers, and Birds in
their naturall colours of Precious
stones, with a Cabinet
priz'd at two hundred thousand
Crownes, coverd with
Agaths, Emerauds, Anamathists,
&c. Within is the passion
of our Saviour with the
twelve Apostles all in Amber.
         
            
In the third is a Cabinet
with Calcidon Pillars, fild (as
they told us) with ancient
medailles of Gold; round about
this Roome is an infinite
number of Naturall and artificiall
curiosities, as the Nalle
turn'd halfe into Gold by Alchymy,
The Emperours head
on a Turqu'oise bigger then a
Walnut, with thousands more.
Next is the Armory, wherein
are the habits, and diverse sorts
of armes of severall ages, and
People; amonst those, the
King of China's habit, Hannibals
Head-piece of Corinthian
metall, Charlemain's Sword;
and an argument of the Italian
Jealousie, an Invention to
lock up female frailty. Here
likewise is a Magnet which
beares up fourescore pound
weight of Iron.
         
            
In the last Cabinet we saw
the curious Turnity of Ivory,
a Pillar of Orientall Alablaster,
&c. and from thence wee went
into the Gardrobe, where are
twelve great Cubbards of silver
Plate, a service all of pure
Massie Gold; A saddle which
the Emperour gave in a present
to the great Duke, all Embroyder'd
with Pearles and Diamonds;
These, with many other
Particularities of this gallerie,
(which might be a Theame
copious enough to write a Volume
on,) declaring the wealth
of this Prince equall with any
Kings in Christendome.
         From the said gallery is a Corrider;
or private passage to the
Palazzo de Pithi, on the other
side of the river; where the
Duke keeps his Court; The
Front of this edifice is very

majestique towards the Basis
of Dorick work, in the midst of
Ionick, in the uppermost story
of Corinthian. In the Court
is a Grotte with statues and a
fountaine over it, yet that
which is most wonderfull is
the Loadstone of a most prodigious
greatnesse.
         Neither are the gardens to
be omitted, which for their
largenesse have the face of a
Forrest, for their variety of
a Paradise. Here Cypres groves,
there Walkes with statues,
here a Sea of Fountaines, there
Swans, Austriches, and other
recreative Creatures.
         Being now on this side of the
Arno, I will take notice of all I
saw there before I returne to
the other. And first there
stands a Pillar, bearing on it
the statue of Peter Martyr, in

the same place where hee was
beheaded. Next on the wall
of S. Nicholas Church, above
a mans reach are these veses,
signifying an inundation of the
River.
         
            ☞ Fluctibus undisonis similis pelagique

            Opida, Agros, Pontes, Maeia,
Templa, Viros.
            M DL. Id sept.
         
         Going now back into the
fuller body of the City, on the
other side of the River; on
the banck there is a Marble,
which I found of no great consequence,
yet set by a Venetian
Embassador as a Monument
to a horse there buried, which
had done him good service in
the siege of the City.
         
            
The Epitaph runs thus.
         
            Non ingratus Herus (sonipes
            Memorande) sepulchrum
            Hoc, tibi pro meritis, haec monumenta
dedit.
         
         Least I should dwell too
long amongst these earthly delights,
wherewith Florence is
fil'd, I will goe and meditate
in the Churches; and first in
the Dome, which I conceive
either for the exquisitenesse of
the worke, or worth of so vast
a Bulke of Red, Black, and
white Marble, to be the fairest
Cathedrall without, that ever
man laid eyes on. Its better
part is the Cupola, so high that
the brasse Globe at the top, is
capable of holding sixteen persons.
         No lesse wonderfull is the
Steeple, which without exempt,

will yield to no other in
the world, composed of the
same stone and materialls with
the Church, but with more art
and ornaments.
         Before the Dome is the Temple
of Mars; built in an Octogon;
now cald S. John, or
the Baptistary. The foure
gates of Brasse, vvhich Ortelius
prefers before any else in the
world, the broken Pillars of
Porphyre, the pavement, the
old Grecian Pieces at the top,
are things to be noted.
         From hence wee went to
see that mirrour of Art, and
wonder of this present age,
Saint Laurents Chappell, which
is so glorious, that whosoever
enters, will even imagine himselfe
in some place above terrestriall.
'Tis wholly overlaid
with fine Pollisht stones, neither

is any colour upon Earth,
but it is there in stones naturally,
all which I have been since
told by diverse, (an argument
of the great riches included in
the Bowells of Italy) are dugg
up within the great Dukes dominions.
Round about this
Chappell are all the scutions of
the townes under the great
Duke, in their proper Colours
of stone. Above are Niches for
the statues of the great Dukes.
Beside them their Urnes. The
intent of this whole sumptious
Fabrick, being that it should
successively serve for the Sepulcher
of the great Dukes.
         Saint Laurents Church and
Convent joyne to this, where
the Library fild with Bookes,
all in Manuscripts is not contemptible.
         Not farre from hence is Santa

Maria Novella; in the Court
are two Marble Pyramids that
stand on brasse Turtoises. Hard
by is S. Maries Church belonging
to the Jacobins, where
on the North wall is the
Tombe of Picus Mirandola,
an eminent schollar, with this
Epitaph.
         
            Joannes jacet hic Mirandola, caetera
morunt.
            Et Tagus è Ganges forsan &
Antipodes.
         
         In the same Church is Politianus
his Tombe subscribed
thus.
         
            Politianus in hoc tumulo jacet
Angelus, unum
            Qui caput, & linguas, (res
nova) tres habuit.
         
         From hence I went to the
Anunciade, and saw in the way
the Fountaine of the Centaure.

The Anunciade is a place of
great devotion, to a Madonna
drawne by the hand of Saint
Luke. In the Piazza before is
the statue of the Duke Ferdinand
the first; on horseback in
brasse, made by the same hand,
with the former above mentioned,
so that there is little difference
betwixt them. Hard by
are kept the Lions, and other
wilde beasts; and a little farther
the Menage or Stables of
the great Duke stord with Barbary
and other excellent horses,
and as I remember, I never saw
better horse then at Florence.
On the wall of the Cavalrizza
is this Inscription.

         Next to these though much
distance, Santa Croce deserves
seeing. Before it is a faire spatious
Court, in which (it being
Carnavall time while wee were
at Florence) we saw the play at
Calce, with Cavalcades, shewes,
and other assemblies of the Nobility.
         Within the Church is the
tombe of that famous Statuary,
Picturer, and Architecture,
Michael Angelo, made by his
owne hand; Over his Urne
stand those three arts, hee was
so renowned for with their
instruments broken, bewailing
the losse of their Patron

underneath this Inscription.

         To conclude my description
of Florence, the houses are
high built, the streets pav'd
with great stones, even and
long, many Fountaines, and other
publick ornaments, declaring
the magnificence of the
great Dukes. For eight mile
round about the City there

seemes another Florence, so full
are the fields speckled with
Country seats. Neither are
those delights to private men alone,
but there are likewise
publike walkes, witnesse that
of Pines two mile long: that
of Cypresses leading to Poggio
Imperiale, and many more.
         Two miles up into the Northerne
Mountaines lies the old
Fesuli, often spoke of amongst
the ancient Writers, but now
a poore Village, not having so
much as the remnants of Antiquity.
         In fine, there is no Province
in Italy more furnish't with delightfull,
and well peopled Cities;
then that of the great
Duke, whose Ancestours having
united the States of three
Common-wealths together, to
wit, Of Pisa, Florence, and Siena,

doth now entirely possesse
all Toscany; the nobler part of
Italy. The wife of this present
Great Duke, Ferdinand the second
of that name, comes from
the Duke of Ʋrbin, of the family
of Rovori.
         The Revenues of this Prince
of Toscany exceeed yearly ten
hundred thousand Crownes,
which will amount to a hundred
thousand pound English,
his ordinary guard is of Cavalry,
and Infantry, with Germans
very well equipag'd.
         The Florentins have commonly
notable head pieces, so
that from hence spring notable
Polititians, and States-men
Machevil was of them, and 'tis
said that three Embassadours
from severall Kings, meeting
accidentally on the way, prov'd
in the conclusion to be all Florentins.
         
            
So soone as we had fill'd our
selves with the sight of those
many singularities, that are in
and about Florence, wee set forward
for Siena.
         Going out of Florence, at
the Porta Romana, one leaves
Poggio Imperiale a Villa of the
great Dukes, which I had omitted
above. At the entrance
of the walkes of Cypres, that
leads to it are the statues of
the Tybre and Arno; those
of the famous old and new Poets,
Virgil, Ovid, Petrarche,
and Dante. The house swarmes
with rarities, chiefly with excellent
Pictures, amongst them
all the line of Austria, this great
Dukes mother, who built this
house, being sister to the Emperour.
         After wee had past by that,
wee lay that night at a little

Bourg call'd Santo Cassiano.
The next morning wee rode
through a Village Barbarino,
from whence the mighty stirring
family of the Cardinalls
tooke their originall. Wee
din'd at Poggio Bonci, a place
noted for the perfumd Tobacco
compos'd there; which the
Italians through custome take
in powder, as profusely, as we
in England doe in the pipe.
From hence in the afternoone
we arriv'd at Siena.
         Siena formerly a free State
of it self, now subject to the
Duke of Florence, stands aloft
covering the back of a hill; so
that in the hottest time of the
yeare, this City is still refresht
by coole gailes of winde; The
ayre is very wholsome, much
agreeing with the constitution
of strangers, the Inhabitants

very curteous, a great deale
suiting to the humours of forreigners,
and besides the purity
of the Italian Language, is
here profest, and spoken; these
and the like conveniences make
it much frequented by Travellers,
and indeed mov'd us to
settle our selves there, for some
Moneths.
         Here wee stayd not to see the
rarities of the Place, which are
not many in number; but to
get some knowledge and practise
in the Vulgar Tongue,
however Siena deserves a better
description then my pen
can afford it; for neatnesse and
gentility, yielding to no other
in Italy.
         At the entrance of the Porta
Camulia, or di Fiorenza, onely
the higher buildings are in
view; but out of the Porta Romans,

the City seemes to raise
it selfe with a great deale of
Majesty; chiefly because of the
many Towers it hath, which
during the time of its Liberty,
were rais'd in honour of such
and such men as had done any
worthy service for the Common-wealth,
amongst these
Towers which stand yet as
signes of its formerly possest
Freedome; that of Mangio
surpasseth for height, which
though its foundations be in
the Bottome of the Piazza, yet
outtops all the City besides, It
serves now for the Clock-house;
From above is a faire
prospect even to the confines
of Toscany, below at the foot
of this hidious Structure, is a
Chappell of Marble, where on
set dayes Masse is said to the
People in publick.
         
            
To this joynes the Senate
house, built by the Goths, as
some conceive by the manner
of the Architecture. At one
end thereof stands a Pillar,
bearing Romulus and Remus
sucking the Wolfe, in brasse,
which are the Armes of Siena,
an infallible argument of its
Antiquity, and certainly dirived
from the Romans, of
whom this City was a Colony.
There are frequently more of
the like pillars about the Town
upon one more decayed, then
the rest is ingraved-Memores
Huberum, old, very old Latine.
         As for the Piazza, which lies
in the heart of the City, I cannot
fancie a more pleasing or
commodious Place; tis of a
large Compasse, resembling
(whether naturally so, or artificially

made so I know
not) the fashion of a Cockle
shell, in the midst is a Marble
Fountaine of curious worke,
wherein out of the Wolves
mouthes comes water. This
place is pav'd with the same
materiall as all the streets of the
City are, to wit, Brick; so that
here and indeed throughout all
Siena, in the fowlest weather
one may walke as cleane as
within dores. The houses are
for the most part Brick, built
alla Moderna, the chiefest is
that of the Pope, and the
Arch bishops, who is of the family
of the Picolominys.
         In the Strada larga lives the
Prince Matthias, the Duke of
Florence's Brother, a man very
courteous to strangers.
         Close by his Palace is the
Dome, or Cathedrall Church of

Sienna, which though in comparison
of others in Italy is
but small, yet for the great travell
and expence which it must
needs have cost, tis inferiour
to none, tis both without and
within of Black and white
Marble; The Facade is admirable,
garnisht with statues;
About the inside are the heads
of all the Popes; The Pulpet
is an unparalelld piece, beset
with figures of Marble. But
that singularity which this
Temple boasts of above all others,
is the pavement, whereon
many parts of the sacred history
are so lively represented
in severall colours of Marble,
as no pensill can come neere it,
though many Masters take patterne
from those stones. Going
up to the high Altar, at the left
hand is the Library, painted

by Raphel d' Ʋrbino; On the
same side is a Chappell, wherein
is kept the arme of S. John
Baptist, which (as an Inscription
there manifesteth) was given
to a Pope by the King of
Peloponesus.
         Opposite to the Dome is the
Hospitall, whither all Pilgrimmes
in their passage to
to Rome, may come and take
two or three meales gratis. In
the Chappell lyes the body of
their founder B. Susorius, as
yet uncorrupted though nine
hundred yeares since he dyed.
         Going downe the Hill, from
the Hospitall, one comes to the
Ponte Brande, which is a reservitoire
of Fish, not so much
for the publick use, as delight,
or pastime.
         Hard by is the House where
Santa Catharina of Siena liv'd,

which, though a place of speciall
devotion, yet not so frequented
as the Madonna di Provenzana.
From hence going
up the hill, by the Dominicans
one sees the Fortification, the
onely defence of the City, and
there by the Cavalrizza, whither
in the sommer all the Gentry
retire a Spasso.
         The walls of Siena are of an
exceeding compasse, yet but
slight, coverd with Caper trees;
that fruit growing best in that
Soyle, to wit, Morter.
         The Country about Sienna,
principally towards the Maremmas
or Marshes, is filld with all
sorts of great Chase, so that
wilde Boare, and other venison
in its season is sold in the
Butchers shops, as commonly
as other flesh.
         In a word, I found Sienna the

most commodious place a
stranger could pick out to live
retiredly, and make his time
beneficiall. Where after two
moneths stay, having made
some little progresse in the language,
the time of Easter occasionly
urging, together with
good company, and the holy
week, we set on for Rome.
         About ten miles from Siena
one goeth over a Bridge,
whereupon is the Prince Matthias
his armes with this Inscription.

Afterwards we past through
Buon Convento, where the Emperour
Henry the seventh dy'd
by poyson, given him in the
Eucharist. Din'd at Tornieri, In
the afternoone past a faire
Bridge, leaving at the right
Mont Alcino, (auciently Mons
Ilicinus) noted for the Muscatello,
it produceth, past through
San Querico; Lay at the next
Post.
         The next day about twelve
miles from Santo Querico wee
past by Radicofany; the last
Fortification of the great
Dukes Dominions situated on
a steep rocky mountaine, beneath
it is the Bourg: and a little
lower one of the greatest Hosteries
or Innes in the way to
Rome.
         That very high Mountaine
which the vallie parts from

that of Radicofany, now cal'd
Montamiata, was Tuniatus
mentiond by Cato and Antonius.
From Radicofany we went
to Centino, din'd there in the
confines of Toscany.
         In the afternoone went over
a faire bridge of Brick, built
by Gregory the thirteenth; Upon
it a Marble speaketh thus.
         
            Omnia dic laeto eveniant &
Fausta Viator
            Gregorio, tutum qui tibi
reddit iter.
         
         Here begins the Stato della
Chiesa, or Patrimony of Saint
Peter: A mile farther is Aquapendente,
of which all the
memoriall I could gather (wee
onely passing through it) is a
very ingenuous direction under
the signe of the Post-house,
it runs thus.
         
         
            L'insegna della Posta, e posta
a posta
            In questa posta, fin che habbia
a sua Posta.
            Ogn' un cavallo a Vetturi in
posta.
         
         From hence the way continues
very even, till one comes
to a rude and stony descent;
downe into a valley, from the
top of which is a most pleasant
prospect, on the Lake of Bolsena,
thirty miles in circuit;
in the midst thereof are two
little Ilands; In the one is a
Convent of Capuchins, where
those of the family of the Farnese
are interd, the other not
inhabited unlesse by Fishermen.
At the side of the Lake
stands Bolsena, on the ruines of
the ancient Vulsinium, famous
in the Romans time. Some monuments

of its former glory,
yet stand chiefly in the Court
of Santa Christiana's Church,
as an Ancient Urne, having Lions
heads, Cornucopias, Satyres,
Furies, pieces of such
art as now the world cannot
imitate, besides this, there is a
heathnish altar of Ophit stone,
frequent pieces of Diaspre Pillars;
from hence wee may gather
that the Volsinienses, were
once splendid though now buried
in their dust.
         Distant from Bolsena seven
miles is Monte Fiascone, in
which way one passeth through
a grove, wherein the ancients
celebrated many Sacrifices to
Juno.
         Monte Fiascone was formerly
the head of the Falisci, a renowned
people in old writers.
         
            
'Tis now spoken of for the
delicious Wine, of which there
is a common story, that a German
Bishop having heard much
commendations of the wine of
that place, sent his servant beforehand
to trye for the best at
all the tavernes in the Towne,
giving him in charge, that
where he found the best hee
should write over the dore Est,
Est; which he did, and having
tasted, the Master approv'd his
choyce, but in fine, he so filld
his body with wine, that hee
left no roome for his Soule; for
he suddenly dyed, and was buried
in Faviono's Church, his
servant bewailing his losse;
caus'd this witty Epitaph to be
put upon his Tombe stone.
         Propter Est Est, Dominus
meus mortuus. Est.
         
            
Leaving Monte Fiascone, one
goes downe into a plaine,
wherein about two mile from
Viterbo, on the right hand is a
Sulphureous Fountaine, the
water perpetually boiling. At
the entrance into Viterbo is this
Verse.
         Ʋrbs Antiqua potens armis

         In the Palace is this.

         The publick Fountaines at
Viterbo are very Remarkable.
         Without Viterbo are two
wayes for Rome, the old which
the Pope in the last difference
with the Duke of Parma,
charg'd none should passe; the
new by Capranica; wee desirous
to see the famous Palace
of Capraroules, belonging to
the aforesaid Duke of the family
of the Farnese, tooke the
old way, which though lesse
usuall, yet gives more satisfaction

by the sight of that magnificent
Fabrick.
         'Tis built in a Heptagon, or
seven corners, before it is a
Kingly Court, within, the Staire
Case, In the Garden the Cataracts
of water, are very admirable:
But that for wch this place
is most spoken of, is the Sellar,
which besides the amplenesse
thereof, is as well stord with
wine of all sorts, the Duke allowing
to all strangers that
come to see his house, two, or
three glasses of fresh liquor.
         Hence, though late at night,
we departed, and strooke again
into the Via nuova, at Monterose
where we lay; From Monterose
to Rome, are twenty Italian
miles, all which Countrey
the Veientes anciently possest, a
people that much hindered the
growth of the Roman Empire,

of which take Florus. Hoc tunc
Veientes fuere: nunc fuisse quis
meminit? quae reliquiae? quodve
vestigium? laborat annalium
fides ut Veios fuisse credamus. So
that if in Florus his time, the
memory of the Veientes was so
extirpated, what signes or remnants
of them can we expect in
this age.
         Six mile beyond Monterose,
upon the Via Cassia, stands Baccano,
and hard by, the Lake
for bignesse not much exceeding
a Pond; yet noted for that
memorable slaughter of the
three hundred Fabii, which
the Veientes hereabouts cut off
in one day. There being but
one child left at home, who afterwards
restord his family,
often serviceable to the Common-wealth.
         After Baccano, there is a passage

through a wood (Maesia
anciently) where heretofore a
passenger could hardly scape
robbing, but of late yeares the
trees being cut downe tis free
from danger. At the end thereof
from the hill, one may discerne
that Mistris of the World
Rome.
         Which before I enter,Rome. I cannot
but premeditate on Saint
Hieromes three wishes, which
were, to have seen our Saviour
in the flesh, to have heard Saint
Paul preach, and to have seen
Rome in its glory; which last,
if ranged amongst the two former
by so learned a Father, it
must needs be one of the happiest
sights mortall eye could
attaine to.
         I must confesse the fame of
Rome, which hath spread it selfe
even to the most remote parts

of the earth; together with the
small intelligence I had in those
histories, that declare the
greatnesse of that universall
Monarchy, made my Idea of
Rome to exceed that of all the
world besides; yet again when
I conceived, how all humane
things are by succession of time
subject to change; how at the
fall of the Roman Empire this
City was pillag'd by the Barbarous,
how through the insatiable
fury of Nero, the fire devour'd
it, I imagind some lower
fancy of Rome.
         But in the conclusion, having
had a full ocular view
thereof, I found that it flourisheth
beyond all expectation,
this New even emulous to exceed
the old, the remnants of
the old adding to the splendour
of the new, both speaking
it

            —Roma triumphati Caput
Orbis.
         
         'Tis so ample a Theame, that
I grow almost confounded in
going about to describe it, and
indeed no man will take that
taske upon him, that hath seen
the diversity of Bookes, and
Impressions there are onely of
the things of Note at Rome.
         One Volume of the Antiquities;
Another of the Pallaces;
a third of the Churches, a
fourth of the Gardens; a fifth
of the Statues; a sixth of the
Fountaines; a seventh of the
Villas; In a word, the Presse
is burdened with nothing more
then discriptions of Rome.
         Wherefore I will briefly
passe over what I saw, leaving
the narration of each particular,
To the Itinerario d' Italia;
and the Roma Antica, and the
Roma Moderna.
         
            
About foure miles from
Rome, in the way that leads to
Porta Del Popolo is Nero's
Tombe, which because of the
honour I owe not to the person
the Tyrant, but to the Antiquity
I will here put down having
never seen it in Print.
         
            
               Neros Tombe
               DMS
KARISSIMA
            
         
         
            
This Sepulcher is of solid
Marble, on it are engraven
Dragons, Fame, &c. The Inscription
is hardly legible, onely
I could pick out Karissima
with a K.
         Within a mile and a halfe of
Rome, we past the Tybre on the
Mole, anciently Pons Milvins,
where (besides the many noble
exploits performed there by
heathens.) Constantine the first
Christian Emperour saw miraculously
the signe of the Crosse,
with the Motto, In hoc signo vinces.
After we were gone over
that Bridge, wee came upon a
very broad pav'd way, The
Via Flaminia, which Flaminius
in his Consulship continued
sixtie miles, from Rome to Ariminum.
         At the entrance into Rome,
at Porta del Popolo, is a lofty Pyramid

coverd with Egyptian
Hyeroglyfiques, which was
heretofore dedicated to the
Sunne, and stood in the Circus
Maximus, but was thence transfer'd,
and placd here by Sintus,
V. as the inscriptions underneath
manifestVid. Rom. Antic. pag. 355..
         Hee that would see Rome
may doe it in a fortnight, walking
about from Morning to
Evening, he that would make
it his study to understand it, can
hardly perfect it in lesse then a
yeare. A man may spend many
Moneths at Rome, and yet
have something of Note to see
every day.
         The first day we walkt to the
Villa of Prince Ludovisio, which
stands on the same Soyle,
where that renowned one of
Salust anciently stood, as one
may collect from the broken

Guglia, one and twenty paces in
length, which was rais'd in his
Hippodromus.
         The principall rarities in this
Kingly place, are the tyr'd gladiator,
Marc Aurelius, his head
of Brasse that stood in the Capitol;
The Oracles head of
Porphyre with the mouth open,
whereby the Priests spake,
those for old; Among the new,
the man Petrified which the
Emperour sent to the Pope. A
Bedstead built all of precious
stones, to the valew of 80000.
Crownes. A bed (as a worthy
Knight then in our Company
said) fit to get none but an Alexander
the great upon. In
the garden are two ancient
Tombes, and sixteen round
Vessells of stone, wherein the
ancient Romans were wont to
keep their Oyle.
         
            
The same day in returning
to our Lodging, wee saw many
Antiquities, Passing by Alta Se
mita, or Mons Quirinalis by the
foure Fountaines, which Lepidus
brought, we came by Monte
de Cavallo, which takes its denomination
from the two Colosses
of Alexander, menaging his
horse Bucephalus, made in emulation
by the two famous
Sculptures, Phidias and Praxiteles.
The horse at the left hand
of Alexander hath under it Opus
Phidiae, that on the right, Opus
Praxitelis. Constantin the
great had these transported out
of Greece, and plac't in his
baths which were adjoyning, as
theVid. Rom. Mod pag. 280. inscriptians underneath
witnesse.
         Afterwards wee past by the
reliques of Antoninus his Basilica,
and sawVid. Rom. Antic. pa. 343 & 346. his and Trajans

triumphant Pillar, the two
most wonderfull pieces of
Rome. The first which M. Aurelius
Antoninus dedicated to
his father Antonius Pius, is 175.
foot in height, and now consecrated
to Saint Paul, whose
statue of Brasse guilded it bears
on the top, that of Trajan
which (as the vast letters on the
Pedistall lately discoverd declare)
was rais'd in honour of
him by the Senate, after his
death, returning from the Dacian
warres, is a hundred twenty
eight foot high from the Basis
whereon it stands.
         On both these two Ensignes
of the Roman glory, are in
Mezzo levato, all the adventures
and battailes of those two
worthy Heros. The last of
these Saint Peter now patroniseth,
whose statue of Brasse is
upon the Head.
         
            
On Palme Sunday we walkt
to Monte Cavallo, a most sumptuous
Palace of his S. to see the
distribution of Palmes, and
Olive branches to the Cardinalls,
with other Ceremonies
of that day.
         From thence we made a circuit
through a part of old
Rome, and saw first the Colosseo,
orVid. Rom. Antic. p. 353. Amphitheatre which Martiall
prefers before the seven
wonders of the world, with
         Omnis Caesareo cedat labor
Amphitheatro.
         This stupenduous Fabrick,
which that Poet through flattery
attributes to Domitian,
was began by Vespasian, and finished
by Titus his sonne. A
great part stands entire to this
day, the rest (which I much
merveile at) was demolisht for

to build two eminent Pallaces,
that of the Farnesi and the
Cancellario.
         On one side of it is a ruine of
theVid. Rom▪ An. i. pag. 19. Meta Sudans, from
whence sprang water, wherewith
the Spectatours refesht
themselves.
         Hard by is theVid. Rom Antic. pag. 173. Arche Triumphall
of Constantin the great,
rais'd in honour of him for his
victory over Maxentius the
Tyrant, at Pons Milvius, as the
inscription on both sides declares.
In the Passage through
on the one side is ingraven Liberatori
Ʋrbis, on the other
Fundatori Quietis. From this
the via Appia began.
         Opposite to this, is theVid. Rom Antic. pag. 171.
Arch of Titus Vespasian, erected
to him for his prise of Jerusalem;
In the work of this Arche
is observd him riding in triumph,

drawne in a Charriot
by foure horses; on the contrary
side, the Golden Candlestick,
The tables of the Law,
the Arca Faederis, and many other
Spoiles taken out of the
temple of Solomon.
         Having gaz'd a little on these
Marbles, which speak Roman
History more palpably then any
Author, we returnd homewards
by Saint John Latran,
saw theVid. Rom. Antic. pa. 350. Obelisque, which with
that before mentioned of the
Madonna del populo, stood in
the Circus Maximus, this is
held to be the biggest of one
stone (to wit, Ophit vulgarly
granito, of which sort all the
Pyramids here are) that ever
came into Rome, there being a
great ship made purposely for
the Carriage.
         It was transported by Constantin

from Alexandria to
Constantinople, by his sonne
Constantius, from thence to
Rome. In Egypt it servd for a
Monument to the King Ramusis,
from which particulars one
may gather that it hath above
two thousand yeares, and yet
by the preservation of Sixtus
V. who plac't it here, it stands
yet entire with Egyptian Characters
upon it.
         The Church of Saint John
Latran,Vid. Rom. Mod. pag. 442. so cald from a Pallace
of the Laterani, which stood
there upon the Mons Caelius, is
the Mother of all Churches, not
for the Fabrick but Antiquity;
twas founded by Constantin;
it would be too long a
Subject to speak of all the particulars,
I will onely name the
chiefe, leaving the rest to the
Prints in Italy.
         
            
At one end of the Porch, is
the statue of Henry the fourth
of France, who gave large revenues
to the Church. At the
high Altar the Pillars of Brasse
are very glorious. Amongst the
many sacred curiosities reserv'd
here; first the Tombe of Helen,
Mother to Constantin the
Great, foure pillars bearing a
stone, which shew the measure
of our Saviours height, the table
whereon the Souldiers cast
Lots. Two Pillars of the vaile
of the Temple wrent, The
Pillar whereon the Cock crew,
&c.
         Without S. John Lat: On
the one side is a little Rotunda,
coverd with Lead, wherein is
the Font, or Baptistarie of Constantin,
with the fairest Pillars
of Porphyre in Rome. On the
other is theVid. Rom. Mod pag. 45 Scala Santa, containing

28. staires, that stood
in Pilats house at Hierusalem,
whereon our Saviour went and
returnd whilst he was in his Agony,
sweating bloud.
         
            
               The Scala Sancta.
               Above is the Sancta Sanctorum, and
over it this verse.
               Non est in toto sanctior Orbe locus.
            
         
         
            
'Tis credited that Helene sent
them to Rome, with many other
things of the holy Land.
         The Popes Pallace of Saint
John Latran, although not inhabited,
yet is no lesse majestick
then the others, wherein
his S. keeps his Court.
         Having seen all the things of
note, within and about Saint
John Lat: we took in our way
homewardVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 486. Saint Mary Maggior
one of the seven Churches;
and for beauty the second in
Rome; The two emulous Chappells
of Paulus quintus, and Sixtus
V. for the variety and preciousnesse
of the stone, imitating
the famous San Lorenzo of
Florence.
         Before the great Dore of this
Church is a highVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 491. Columne,
taken out of the Temple of
Peace, twas set up and dedicated

to the Virgin (whose statue
is on the top) by Paulus V
wherefore it stands perpendicularly
on foure brasse Coquatrises,
the armes of the Borghesi,
out of which family
came Paulus quintus. On the
other side of Santa Maria Maggiore
is a Pyramid not so large
as the others translated thither
from the Mausoleum of Augustus.
         In the afternoone wee saw
little, onely tooke a slight view
of the Campo Vaccino, fild with
Antiquities; another day in the
morning, we went to the Vatican;
In the way is Pons Elius,
now Del Castello Santo Angelo,
so cald from the Castle of S. Angelo
by it, which was anciently
Vid. Rom. Antic. pag. 215 Moles Adriani. 'Twas built
by Adrian the Emperour, as a
Sepulcher for him and his Successours;

and in regard it stands
yet so firme and entire, tis reductiuto
the forme of aVid. Rom. Mod. pag 3. Fortresse,
wherein are kept the
three millions of Gold, which
money may bee employd on no
use, unlesse to defend the
State Apostolique, in point of
armes.
         From hence looking into the
Tyber,* Vid. Rom Antic. pag. 190. one may discerne some
ruines of the (a) triumphant
Bridge, yet so little are the remnants
thereof, that tis hard to
judge it to have been so glorious
as it was, however, tis said
the Jewes offerd his S. fiftteen
thousand Crownes, that they
might turne the course of the
Tybre for some Moneths, and
have all they could find about
this Bridge, In which I believe
the Jewes would not have been
loosers, it being the custome of

the ancient Romans, when they
past over the Tybre in triumph,
to fling in a part of their spoiles
taken from their enemies, yet
his S. would not assent thereunto,
least the turning of the
river might prove prejudiciall
to the City.
         From the Castello Santo Angelo
is a Corridor that goes unto
the Vatican, the Popes winter
Pallace, to which joynes Saint
Peters.
         Before these two prime structures
of new Rome; is a wide
Court, in the midst whereof is
an Esguile orVid. Rom. Antic pag. 349. Pyramid bore
upon foure Lions of Brasse,
which heretofore stood in Nero's
Cirque, and was Dedicated
to Julius Caesar, whose ashes
were conserv'd at the top,
where now the Crosse triumpheth.
This Pyramid beareth

no Hierogly fixes as the others,
but is more firme and to
sight newer.
         In the some Court is a Fountaine,
from whence flowes a
streame of water, and indeed
throughout all Rome no street
wants a publick Fountaine;
wherefore, because they are so
common I omit them.
         
            Vid. Rom Mod pag. 6. Saint Peters Church, as Erasmus
said of that at Canterbury,
—Tanta sese Majestate in
coelum erigit, ut etiam procul in
tuentibus, Religionem incutiat.
In a word, tis the most perfect
modell of decent Magnificence
in the world, there being an
answerable Uniformity both
within and without. The Frontis
piece is glorious with the
Colosses of Christ, and the
twelve Apostles, the Porch it
selfe is ample enough to bee a

Temple; Entring into the
Church one admires the work
of the top, which is all of
squares, Levati as they call it,
after the same manner with the
Pantheon. In the Cupola is represented
the Coelestiall Hierarchy
in pieces of Mosaick, so
well that to all Beholders they
seeme painted; In the Center
of the Church stands the great
Vid. Rom. Mod. pag 10. Altar, the most singular piece
both for the materiall and art
that ever humane hand produc't,
tis all of solid Brasse, taken
from the covering of the
Rotunda, and afterwards melted
into so stupenduous Pillars,
each one whereof weighes five
and twenty thousand pounds,
besides other diversity of Overages,
the whole so unpareld a
worke, that tis fit to stand in no
Cathedrall, unlesse S. Peters.
         
            
* The Vatican Pallace is such
a Sea of lodgings, that tis said
three Kings may at the same
time have roome enough for
themselves and followers.
         In these large buildings are
containd so many worthy Rarities,
as the whole world affords
not the like; witnesse first that
most famous Library of Christendom;
The Vatican, wherin
severall stanzas, or Centuries
are most choise Bookes, as well
Manuscripts as Prints. At the
entranee into the Bibliotheque,
are the two ancient statues of
Hippolitus and Aristides; round
about upon the walls, are pictur'd
the generall Counsells.
         Amongst other rare Manuscripts,
which are to bee seen
here, as Virgils, Terence, and
many Roman Authors, written
with their owne hands, there

are likewise (though of later
Date) King Harry the eights
Letters to Anne of Bulloyne,
some in French, some in English;
those beginning commonly
with My Darling, or a lascivious
expression, together with his
Booke against Luther, which
procurd him the Title of Defender
of the Faith, and at the
end these two verses written
with his own hand.
         
            Anglorum Rex Henricus Leo
Decime mittit
            Hoc opus, & Fidei testem &
amicitiae.
         
         In the Opposite Stanza is
the Palsgraves Library, taken
at Auspurg, and sent afterwards
as a present to his S. Here also
is kept the true draught of Mahomets
cheast. On the wall are
picturd the machins, and inventions

us'd in raising the Pyramid
before Saint Peters with
these verses.
         
            Saxa agit Amphion Thebana
ut Maenia condat
            Sixtus & inmensae ponera
Molis agit.
         
         Many other singularities are
there in this Library, from
whence passing through the
Conclave, we went downe into
the armory, which standing
underneath, doth as it were
support the Library, wherefore
the Motto over the Dore is
Ʋrbanus VIII. Litteris arma,
Armis litteras.
         
         The Sword must uphold the
pen, the pen the Sword. There
are armes, and all accomplishments
for five and thirty thousand
Men, Horse and foot.
         
            
Next to these, passing
through a long gallerie, where
the Maps of the Provinces of
old and new Italy are printed
at large, we came into Belvedere
so cald, because from thence
one hath most parr of Rome in
view; There are five gardens,
some in Terrace, others low, in
that of Belvedere, stands that
vast Pine Apple of Mettall,
which stood on the top of Moles
Adriani, with two Peacocks
of the same materiall which
stood on Scipio's Tombe; The
other gardens are fild with
groves of Orange trees, and admirable
Fountaines, amongst
which the artificiall Ship is
most dilectable. In the last garden
in Niches, shut up are the
best and most ancient statues of
Rome, as that ofVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 20. Laocoon and
his two sonnes, all of one Marble;

The Cleopatra, the Niobe,
the Romulus and Remus sucking
the Wolfe; The Nilus,
The Tybre, all famous pieces;
the first to wit, Loacoon was
found in the seven halls of Titus.
         In the Vatican hall (the walls
of which are of Marble) is pictur'd
the Massacre of France,
under one side Coligni & Sociorum
caedes, on the other Rex
Coligni necem probat. In the
Vatican Chappell we saw the
judgement designd by Michael
Angelo, a piece which cannot be
valued for its excellency.
         After we had seen all the appartements
of this vast house,
returning homeward, we stept
into Santa Maria de Cavalli
Scossi, where there is the stone
on which Abraham offerd Isaack,
and another whereon our

Saviour was circumcis'd, with
this which ad libitum credas.
         
            Hic lapis est in quem Natum
templo obtulit olim
            More Hebraeorum Virgo Maria
suum.
         
         In the next Church the Pillars
are reserv'd in wodden
cases, which Saint Peter and
Saint Paul were tyde too, and
whip't.
         In the afternoone wee walkt
to the Emperour Justinians
gardens, and going out by Porto
del Popolo, just against the
Pyramid upon the wall, I espide
this sentence, which intimates
the inundation of the
Tybre above the height of a
man.
         ☞ Notas Quirite hic Imprime hic
Tybris fui.
         The gardens of Justinian

are not so full of delights, as
throng'd with Antiquities,
which are for the most part
Urnes of stone, amongst which
is Minuius Felix his; Here is
besides the Emperour Justinians
Colosse, and the seventh of
the termini or lapides that
stood on the Via Appia, the first
is in the Capitoll and none else
to be found. There is a Volume
out in print onely about
this garden
         From thence we went to the
Villa Borghese Which without
exempt may for all excellencies
bee preferr'd before any other
about Rome or in Italy; Before
we came into the Parke, wee
past through a little house,
where the artificiall raine: with
the diversity of waterworks,
by putting on severall heads,
on the same fountaine is very

ingenuous. The gardens and
Parke want nothing which
should make a man conceive
himselfe in Paradise. Groves
of Laurells, Pines, Cypresses,
ame Haires, Deares, Peacocks,
Swans, Feasants, and all recreations
the world can afford. In
the gardens the foure Sphinxes
of ancient stone are to be noted.
The outside of the house is adornd
with foure Frontispieces
of ancient Sculptures, in
Basso Relievo, amongst which,
Curtius falling into the Vorago,
Europa beard away on a Bull,
Leda suckt by a Swan are most
exquisite; Within the house
the Hall beset with Pillars of
Porphyre, and other precious
stone, Seneca bleeding to death
of Jet; The great Diana that
Pompey worshipt of Orientall
Marble, The Gladiatour

menacing the heavens, The
Hermophrodite on the bed, and
for new pieces the Daphny and
David.
         Another day, in the morning
we lookt, into the Palazzo
Borghese, hard by our lodgeing,
which is one of the greatest,
and most royall about
Rome; In the Court the Rowes
of Marble Pillars and the Arcades,
are very magnificent,
Here about where this Pallace
stands, was the Campus Martius.
         From thence we went to the
Palazzo Farnese, but in the way
wee tooke a full view of the
Rotunda, orVid. Rom. Antic. pag. 248. Pantheon, the
most absolute entire Antiquity
in all Rome, which was
built by Marc. Agrippa, and dedicated
to all the Gods, and is
now to the Virgin and all the
Saints.
         
            
There was an Ascent into the
Pantheon in the ancient times,
but now one goes downe into
it, (from whence I collect how
the ruines of old Rome lay buried
in the earth; besides, if
there be any digging for to lay
the foundations of a house in
Rome, they still finde pieces of
statues, heads of Pillars, and the
like) yet for height it wants
nothing of its first, and indeed
to this day it seemes rather the
worke of Giants, then common
men. So vast are the thirteen
Columns in the Porch, so
stupenduous the Moles within,
representing the world with
its orbicular forme.
         In the Porch is an ancient
Sculpture of the primitive
Christians, with this Inscripon,
which because tis not in
the Prints I will not omit.

         From the Pantheon we went
directly to the Palazzo Farnese,
which glorious fabrick was
rais'd out of the ruines of the
Amphitheatre; for the commendations
of the Architecture, tis
enough to say Michael Angelo
had a chiefe part therein. Before
it are two of the fairest
Fountaines about Rome.
         
            
In the Court the Hercules,
and the Flora, are very noted
Statues. But that which surpasseth
all Statues, not only here,
but in all Rome (and if in Rome
surely in all the world) is the
Vid. Rom. Mod pag. 205. Tauro Farnese; A Bull with a
dog and five persons, every one
bigger then the Naturall cut
to wonder out of one stone, the
worke of Apollonius and Tauriscus
of Rhodes, from whence
it was conducted and plac't in
Antoninus his bathes, where it
was dug up a hundred yeares
since, as Intire as if made but
vesterday; and now stands in
this pallace astonishing all that
behold it.
         In the afternoone wee went
to the Antiquities of theVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 402. Capitol;
At the foot of the staires,
are two Lions of Ancient stone,
wch stood before the Rotunda,

at the head, the statues of Castor
and Pollux holding their
horses; The Trophees of Marius,
The Primus Lapis, with a
Ball of Brasse on the top; In
the midst of the place is the
Marcus Aurelius on horseback,
of Brasse, and underneath
the Marforius, which because
of the Posture, Combente, as
those of rivers use to be, tis suppos'd
was made for the Rhene;
Under the staires of the Senate
house, is a Fountaine with the
statue of Rome in red of Porphyre,
having on the sides the
Tigris, and the Tybre.
         At the right hand, as one
comes on the Capitall hill is the
Conservatorio, so cald because
most of the precious Antiquities
are kept there;Vid. As one
goes in,Rom. Anic. pag. 69 are the statues of Julius
and Augustus Caesar, the *

Columna Rostrata with an Inscription
of very old Latine;
not grammaticall with ours,

         In the Court is the hand and
head of Commodus, his Colosse
in Brasse, The foot and head
of the Colosse of Apollo, of a
most stupenduous vastnesse. A
Pila, with the ravishing of the
Sabins in Relievo, with Severus,
and Mamea upon it. In the little
Court going up the staires are
foure admirable pieces of Basso
Relievo of Aurelius his triumph.
         
         
         
         
         
            
At the top of the staires the old
Statue of Marius, a Table of
Brasse with the old Lawes, in a
gallerie hard by are the names
of the Old and New Consuls.
         The names of the Consuls
when I was at Rome were these.
         
            Primo Januarii: MDCXLVII.
            
               Petrus Prignanus.
               Julius Gironus.
               Vincentius Baccellia. Coss.
               Benedictus Masseius.
            
         
         Within the Hall, and other
Roomes of the Capitoll, are
most worthy statues, both new
and old, for New those of severall
Popes, for old those of
Cicero; Virgil; The Hercules of
Mettall, with the Lupus Fulmine
tactus, and a hundred more
things worth observation.
         Upon this same Mons Capitolinus,
is a Church cald Ara

Celi, which stands on the same
ground where the Temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus stood.
         The next day in the morning
wee went to the Palazzo
Barberino, which I cannot say
to bee inferiour or superiour to
the others of Rome, for indeed
the Pallaces of Rome are so excellent,
that they will admit of
no comparison amongst themselves,
for in what one comes
short of another in one particular,
it outgoes it in some thing
else.
         The Palazzo Barberino is alwayes
to bee reckond amongst
the chiefe, whither for the
Structure, or for the Rarities.
         In the Court lies a broken
Pyramid. In the Galleries are
admirable statues, and amongst
them the old, old Egyptian

Idoll Osiris, of a black strange
stone, the forme of it because I
never saw it printed, I will not
omit.
         
            
               OSIRIS
In Aed. Card.
Barb.
            
         
         Osiris implies the figure of an Oxe, yet
blind Antiquity attributed any strange
shape to that Liety.
         
            
From this pallace wee went
up to the Via Pia, The first
thing of note wee saw, was a
Round Chappell, one of the
Torrions ofVid. Rom. Anic, pag. 309. Dioclesians Bathes
which are hard by, with vast
Columnes and Fragments of
Marble.
         After that we stept into Santa
Maria della Vittoria, where
the Ensignes hang which were
taken in Germany, to wit, the
Crosse Keyes and the Miter,
with the motto Exterpentur.
Against this Church stands the
famous Fountaine of the great
Moyses striking the Rock, out
of which gusheth water; The
two Lions on each side were
brought from before the Rotunda.
The Popes granaryes are
hard by.
         From thence we went to the
Villa Montalto on the Viminal,

saw the Water workes, the Citron
trees in great number,
with thousand rarities. In returning,
wee saw the Church
from whence the Arrians were
expeld, together with the Villa
Aldobrandina.
         In the afternoone wee walkt
amongst the Antiquities, and
saw the Rupis Tarpeia, the Temple
ofVid. Rom. Antic. pa. 168. Janus Quadrifrons, a
solid square of Marble, with
foure gates which represented
the foure quarters of the yeare,
or foure parts of the world.
About it are many Nichi,
wherein stood the statues of the
Moneths, as some suppose. The
place where this Temple is, was
anciently calld Velabrum, or
Forum Boarium, as the Arco Boario
there standing by Saint
Georges Church testifieth.
         Hard by on the mount Palatin

are the ruines of theVid. Rom. Anic. pag. 86. & 88. Palazzo
Maggiore, or seat of the Caesars.
         The Valley betwixt this hill
and the Aventin, was theVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 326. Circus
Maximus.
         At the foot of the Aventin
are Antoninus his Bathes. And
on all sides fragments of Antiquitie,
which shew that the Romans
built to last unto eternity.
         The sixth day in the morning
wee went to Saint Peters,
where wee saw his S. carried
about in Pompe, with his triple
Crowne, his breaking of the
Toarch, with other Ceremonies
of the excommunication,
and his washing of the Pilgrims
feet, to humble himselfe.
         In the afternoone, wee walkt
amongst some Antiquities, first

passing along the Tyber, wee
saw theVid. Rom. Antic. pag. 202. Insula Tiburtina,
which was made of the wheat
of Tarquinius his granaries,
that was cast into the River after
his banishment out from
Rome; Secondly, theVid. Rom. Antic. pag. 207. Bridge
wheron Horatius Cocles fought,
when he commanded his men
to cut downe a piece, and to
leave him to his enemies.
         A little farther, by the Via
Ostiensis is the Pratum, where
they us'd their Olympick
games; and in the same Medow
is the Mons Testaceus so cald,
because the Romans which in
their Temples and Sacrifices
us'd earthen vessels much, were
wont to carry all their broken
Pots to this place, which in time
grew to such a heap, that at this
day there is a high hill of Potshares,
from whence wee had a

full view of all the seven hills
of Rome, to wit, the Capitoline,
The Pallatin, The Aventine,
The Celius, The Esquiline,
The Viminall, The Quirinall.
         Against Testaceus in the walls
of Rome, just by the Gate that
leads to Ostia, is a huge Pyramid
of Marble,Vid. Rom. Antic. pag. 225. Cestius one of
the rich Epulons Tombe.
         On good Friday wee went
to S. Peters, wherein his Sanctities
Chappell wee saw most
admirable Representations.
And there wee found opportunity
to goe into the Vaults, under
Saint Peters, where we saw
diverse Sepulchers of the primitive
Christians, that of Pope
Adrian the fourth, an English
man, of Porphyre. The Chappell
where the bodyes of Saint
Peter and S. Paul were interd.
         
            
In the afternoone, wee went
to the Campo Vaccino, but in
the way stands Saint Pauls
House, where according to the
Acts,Act. 28. 30. Paul dwelt two whole
yeares in his owne hired house,
&c.
         TheVid. Rom. Mod. pag. 428. Campo Vaccino was heretofore
the Forum Romanum,
fild with the best buildings about
Rome, of which great remnants
are yet standing. Going
downe into it from the Capitoll,
in the wall towards the foundations
of the new Capitoll is
some part of the old, of mighty
great stones. On the left is the
Prison anciently Tertullianum,
now San Pietro in Carcere, because
hee was there imprisond.
         At the foot of the Capitoll is
theVid. Rom. Antic. pag. 165. Arc triumphal, of Septimius
Severus suppos'd to be the

first that was erected in Rome,
amongst the worke upon this
Arche is be seen the fashion
of the Roman Aries.
         The three Pillars which stand
buried halfe way in the ground
behind the Capitoll, are of the
Temple of Jupiter stator.
         The seven the Temple of Concorde.
         The third in the midst of
Campo Vaccino, The Temple of
Jupiter tonant.
         Hard by there is the Vorago,
whereinto Curtius threw himselfe,
and a good way towards
the Villa Farnese, the place
wher Remus and Romulus were
found by Faustulus.
         At the other end of the Campo
Vaccino, is theVid. Rom. Antic. pa. 239. Temple of
Peace, where Vespasian conserv'd
that precious Treasury
he brought away from Hierusalem.
         
            
On the Palatin the Temple
of Isis.
         One morning we went to S.
John Latran, where we saw the
solemnity of a Moore, and two
Iewes baptis'd in Constantins
Baptistary.
         From thence we went to the
Villa Matthei, in the way runs
Claudus his Aquiducts, and
hard by is the Temple of Fannus,
a very entire Antiquity,
now Saint Stefano Rotundo.
         In the Villa Matthei there is
an ancient Pila, a Pyramid, the
Colosse of Alexander, things
as pleasing to the judicious, as
the other delights of the gardens
to the ignorant.
         The same day about the Evening,
we went to the Greeks
Church where wee saw the
Ceremonies of the Easterne
Churches, and heard their Service

all in Greek. On Easter
day wee went to Saint Peters,
to see the manner of his S. receiving
the Eucharist: The
rest of that day wee repos'd to
fit our selves for the voyage of
Naples, so that now after so
satisfactory a sight of this Mistris
of the world Rome, we bid
her adieu for a time, leaving
what we now omitted till our
Returne.
         The voyage from Rome to
Naples, though it bee the most
dangerous passage in Italy, because
the wayes are so throng'd
with Banditos, yet in the upshot
it proves no lesse requisite
to mindes inquisitive in the
Roman Antiquities; no lesse
delightfull to men that would
see the Wonders of Nature,
then any other in Europe.
         There is all the way so many

fragments of the Roman glory,
that tis hard to judge whither
Rome and Naples were
once joynd together, or whither
Pozzuolo was the Suburbe
of Rome.
         From whence wee set forth
out of Port. Lat: anciently
Asinaria; a mile out of the City
there are on all sides pieces
of Antiquity. On the right
hand we left the Aquiducts of
of Ancus Martius, and Claudius,
with the new of Sixtus Quintus
not so stately as the old, on
which the Aqua Felice runnes
sixteene miles. A little farther
on the right upon the Via Appia,
is theVid. Rom Antic. pa. 228. Sepulcher of Metella
Crassus his wife, now Capo
di buove from the Oxes heads
of Marble upon it, with many
more ancient Tombes.
         Hard by is the Cirque of Caracalla,

where lies the Pyramid
that the old Earle of Arundell
would have bought, but in regard
of the vastnesse, could
find no possibility of conveying
it to the Tyber, tis said the present
Pope after his Nephewes
Pallace in Piazza di Navona is
finisht, will erect it there in
Circus Agonalis.
         These and diverse more Antiquities
we had in view, round
about us, till wee came unto
Frescati.
         Where having dined, wee
walkt up to old Tusculum, to
see Ciceros house, where hee
compos'd that immortall testimony
of Morality and learning,
his Tusculans Qnestions.
tis situated on the top of a hill
two mile above Frescati; so
that some give the Etemology
 from  vexare,

because tis troublesome to goe up to.
         Tullies house stands, that continually
tis refresht with gales of winde,
and hath on all sides a most pleasant
Prospect, even to the Mediterranean
Sea, it shewes it self thus in its ruines.
         
            
               Jullies Jusculan House
               In the ruine vnder the letter. A. was
of late yeares found a treasure.
               B. Tullies house whereof. 10. Vaults
are yet very firme.
               C. The place where his Piscina or
Fish-ponde was.
            
         
         
            
The territorie of Frescati, as
it was the ancient delight of the
Romans, so it is as yet coverd
with Gardens and Villas, about
ten Cardinalls having their
Countrey seats there. A place
of such ravishing delights, as fitter's
for the Gods to inhabit
then men. Such is the Quantity
of trees, which keep perpetually
green, the murmuring
of Fountaines and the like.
         Amongst the the Villa's, the
chiefe, and which wonderfully
declares the ingenuity of the
Italians, is the Aldobrandina,
which for divises in water is the
first within or without Rome,
I think I may say in the world.
Quite through the garden, falls
a Cataract, or deluge of water,
towards the Embushment of
which, stand two Serpentin
Pillars of Mosaick, from the

tops of which, the water creeps
downe; Below in the Court is
that admirable Fountaine, in
which is represented Atlas
throwing up water, which
forceth artificiall Thunder, and
a perfect Rainbow; Whil'st the
Elements seeme here to bee at
difference; A Satyre blowes a
horne lowder then I ever heard
a man; And Pan in the Interim,
playes two diverse tunes
upon the Organes: Things
that strike astonishment to all
the Spectators, which whosoever
they be, must looke to goe
away wet to the skinne, as we
did, and from thence went into
a place cald the terrestiall
Paradise, and not undeservedly;
for as the other inventions
are mov'd by water, so these
goe by wind. At the end of it
is fashiond a hill, Parnassus

whereon set the nine Muses
with severall winde Instruments
that sound by art. Underneath
this hill are Organs,
which plaid divers tunes so distinctly,
that wee conceiv'd
some Master was playing on
them, but looking wee saw
they went of themselves, the
cause of all this wee afterwards
saw; In the midst of the roome,
there being a Hole out of wch
winde issueth, so violently,
that for halfe a quarter of an
houre it beares up a Ball.
         Leaving Frescati, that afternoone
we past by Diana's Lake,
and the wood famous for the
fiction of Acteon. From thence
wee had a woody and mountanous
way unto Veletri, where
wee lay, Veletri heretofore belongd
to the Volsci, and the ancestors
of Augustus came from
thence.
         
            
The best things to be seen in
it now is the statue of Pope
Ʋrban the eight, in rasse, and
the publick fountaines.
         The next morning having
past downe the hill, whereon
Veletri stands, wee came into a
plaine Country, and din'd at
Sermoneta, fifteen miles from
Veletri.
         In the afternoone, about
three miles from Sermoneta, we
past by a Tower, built on the
top of a Rock, to defend the
Country from Robbery, as
they say, though I believe more
to take money for passage,
through the Gate below.
         Five Italian miles farther,
neere to the Casa Nuova, and
casa Biancha at the foot of the
hills, at the left are the Tres Tabernae,
or three Tavernes, where
the Brethren met Saint Paul, in

his voyage to Rome; according
to the Acts. They shew themselves
in this forme now, & are
indifferent entire, they being
built as the other Fabricks
of the Romans, of great stones
and Bricks in Square.
         
            
               Tres Tabernae
mentioned Act: 28th
            
         
         
            
Just before the Tres Tabernae
are the Pomptine Fennes, and
above, on a hill stands Setia,
which Martiall saith
—Pendulam Pomptinos spectare
campos.
         
         That night wee lay at Piperno,
at the Post house on the
other side of the Hill; but before
we there arriv'd, wee saw
the Quarters of many Banditas
hangd on the high way side, an
argument of the great hazard
one undergoes in this journey,
if not a competent number together.
Piperno heretofore Privernum
was a City of the Volsci,
noted onely for the Birth of
Virgills Camilla, who came
from thence.
         The next morning leaving
Piperno, wee past by a Convent,
with a faire ancient Church
cald Fossa Nova, where Thomas

Aquinas died, which Place was
the Appii Forum. Likewise
mention'd by Saint Luke, in his
description of Saint Pauls voyage
to Rome.
         About foure miles farther, at
a high Tower wee enterd upon
the Via Appia, that Queen of
wayes, which Appius in his
Consulship▪ lead from Rome to
Capua, and which Trajan afterwards
extended to Brundusium.
         This street if I may so call
it (the ruines of houses,
Tombes, and the like on both
sides of it, testifying the former
beauty thereof) is compacted
of such solid stones, that after
so long a succession of time,
neither the continuall passage
of foote or horse, nor the injurie
of weather, hath yet consum'd
any part of it, unlesse that

which past through the Pomptine
Fennes which the water
hath overflowde, the rest is
very entire and firme, chiefly
from this Tower to Terracina,
where we dind.
         Terracina was formerly Anxur,
as Livie hath it, Anxur fuit
quae nunc Terracinae sunt Ʋrbs
prona in paludes, it stands on the
Cercean Promontory, according
to that of Virgill

               —Circaeumque jugum queis
               Jupiter Anxuris oris-Praesidet.
            
         
         Upon which Servius in his
Comentarie gives the dirivation
of Anxur, quasi  sine
novacula, because that Jupiter
imberbis was there worshipt;
a part of which Temple yet
stands in the walls of the Dome,
as the vast Marbles and pieces
of Pillars witnesse; Before it
are some old inscriptions, with

a Pillar to Theodorick for having
dry'd the Fennes, and renewed
the way; over the old
Inscriptions are these new.

               Inclyta Gothorum Regis monumenta
vetusta
               Anxurei hoc oculis exposuere

From Terraccina to Fondi,
are ten miles, which way lying
in the Confines of the State of
Rome, and the Kingdome of
Naples, is the most dangerous
part of all the voyage. From
Terracina wee first past by the
Emperour Galbas Villa; of
which take Suetonius. Ser. Galba
Imperator M. Valerio Messalla,
Cn. Lentulo Coss. natus
est IX. Kal. Januarii in villa
Colli supposita prope Tarracinam

         Two mile farther wee came
to a wall with a Gate, which is
the entrance into the Kingdome
of Naples, where on a
Marble Table I read thus.
         Hospes hic sunt Fines regni
Neopolitani, si amicus advenis
pacatè omnia invenies, &
malis moribus pulsis, bonas
leges.
         
            
From thence keeping right
on the Via Appia, plaine and
even, wee saw many pieces of
Antiquity, amongst which was
an ancient Tombe, very entire,
but whose, tis not certaine.
         In this pleasant passage wee
came at length to Fundi, where
we lay that night.
         Fundi, though spoild of all
signes of its Antiquity, yet still
keeps its old name, as Cicer:
Atic.
         —Fundis accepi tuasitt eras
caenans.
         Tis scituated in a low plain,
and as the Poet saith

               Collibus hinc atque inde Lacu
simul aequore cinctum
               Citria cui florent hortis è
littore Myrti.
            
         
         The Territoire about is very

fruitfull of Orange trees, so
much that wee went into an
Orchard, and for twenty Citrons
& about thirty Oranges,
wee gave the Owner a Julio,
(that comes to an English six-pence)
which very well contented
him, and I believe if we
had stood to agree upon the
price, wee might have had as
many more for that money.
         Over a gate on the left hand
at Fundi, is this old Inscription.
         EnVmmis Fronius LF DECTIEN

         Neer to Fondi we saw the Mons
Caecubus noted amongst the
ancients for the good Wine it

bore, as Martiall saith.
         —Caecuba Fundanis generosa
coquuntur ahenis.
         The next morning insisting
yet on the Via Appia;
which though mountanous in
that part, yet hath on both
sides Myrtles, Bayes, Locusts,
Pomegrannets, and such like
Verts, that grow wild in
the Hedges, we came at length
to an ancient Torret, built
halfe of solid Marble; which
after little examination wee
found to bee Ciceros Tombe,
his Villa Formiana famous for
his Slaughter, being there;
Tullies Sepulcher is now in this
figure. As in the page following.
         
         
            
               Jullies tombe at his
Vida Formiana
            
         
         This Tombe stands in an Olive
garden, and at that instant when
we rode by, a labourer working
there, dug up two old Coines,

which some of our Company
bought. From hence we were
in view of Cajeta; Of which
Virgil saith,

               Tu qoque littoribus nostris
Aeneia Nutrix
               Aeternam moriens famam Cajeta
dedisti.
            
         
         The City lies in a Peninsula,
very strong, and hard to come
to by Land, but over a narrow
Isthmus.
         The mountaine cleft in sunder
by an Earthquake (which
commonly happen in the Kingdome
of Naples) is very hidious.
The Inhabitants beare a
great reverence to this place,
for that they believe it happened
at the same time when our
Saviour was in his Passion.
         In the Church hard by the
Trinitate, amongst other things

to be seen, there's the Corpes
of the Duke of Bourbon in a
wodden Chest, who was kild
in attempting to surprize Rome;
His Epitaph is thus in Spanish.
         
            Francia me dio la luze
            Espanna m' esfuerzo y ventura,
            Roma mi dio la muerte
            Gaëta la Sepoltura.
            France gave me breath,
            Spaine strength to Armes did call,
            Rome gave me Death;
            Gajeta Buriall.
         
         In the great Church at Gaieta
is a huge Crater or Bowle,
now put to the use of a Font,
which was dug up out of the
ruines of Formia. The worke
so good that the Sculptor
was not asham'd to put his
name to it; for thereon is
this.
         
         
            
               
               ,
.
         
         At Gajeta twill quit the
paines of climing up the Promontory,
to see the Mausoleum
of L. Munatius Plancus,
one of Ciceros Pupills, a most
entire Antiquity; over the dore
may plainly be read.

         From this a Chronologer

standing.
         The Countrey from Mola to

Gajeta, containes more Orange
trees then any I know, except
Naples it selfe.
         A little farther, about a mile
from Mola, Formiae anciently,
a Marble on the Via Appia
speaks thus
         Plautius Theodo Pil: Apella
Magister Augustalis Plautiae
A. L. Rufae ConLibert. Concubin.
Piae Plautiae Aug▪ L.
Faustae Libert.
         That day wee dind at Mola,
where there is to bee seen Ciceros
Grote, in which he wrote
many of his familiar Epistles.
         In the afternoone eight miles
from Mola, we came unto Garigliano,
where the famous City
Minturna stood, as a very entire
Aquiduct, an Amphitheatre,
with many other ruines testifie.
         
            
Having past here the river
Liris, that terminated old Latium
we came into the Medowes
of Minturna, where Marius hid
himselfe in his flight from Sylla;
at the end of those fields
runs along, Mons Massicus, so
renown'd for the wines it produc't,
tis now cald Garo, and
from thence the river Liris,
Garigliano, adjoyning are the
ruines of Senuessa, as Martiall
—Et Senuessanis venerunt
Massica Praelis.
         
         That night wee lay in Ager
Falernus, at a Village calld S.
Agatha, at the bottome of Sessa,
formerly Aurunca.
         The Ager Falernus is all that
space of ground, which lies betwixt
the Mons Massicus, and
the River Vulturnus, so that because
of their affinity, Vinum

Massicum and Falernum was
us'd promiscuously by the Ancients.
         The next morning, we past
by Torre di Francolesse, where
Hanniball being besieg'd by Fabius
Maximus, escapt through
that famous stratageme of making
his enemies drunke.
         Two mile farther, wee came
in view of that happie Plaine
of Campania, now Terru di Lavoro,
which most Authors, as
well Moderne, as old, extoll
for the most fruitfull plat of
earth, that is in the Universe.
In a word, twas the Subject of
Virgils Georgicks.
         In which having rode five
miles, wee came to dinner at
New Capua, which though so
cald in regard of the other, yet
hath some remnants of Antiquitie.
In the Cloister of a

Church, are some Ancient
Tombes.
         In the midst of the City, at
the entrance as I suppose of the
Jesuites Colledge, is this old
Inscription.
         Julio Auroxonti Leonidae. Ʋ.

         The old Capua, the delight
of Hanniball, and Paragon with
Rome, and Carthage is two mile
off out of the way, on the left
where the ruines of Columnes,
Theatres, Temples, Porches
shew its former Magnificence.
From Capua to Naples, the way

is even, spacious, and like a garden,
tis indeed Campania. The
fertility of which is such, that
if the owner have not as much
Wine out of one Vine, as will
load five Mules, he thinkes his
labour ill spent, an incredible,
though true argument of the
fruitfullnesse, of this Countrey.
In the mid-way stands Anversa,
and eight miles farther
Naples.
         This Metropolis of that
Kingdome,Naples. which takes its denomination
from thence, is a
Maritimate on the Mediterranean
shoare.
         Tis ancient, though Neapolis,
and was first cald Parthenope.
At this present tis reckond the
third City in Italy, and so great
are the delights which nature
hath allowed to this place, that
tis still frequented by men of

high condition, and great personages,
so that it hath taken
the Epethite, Naples the Gentle.
         The streets of Naples are generally
well pav'd of freestone,
especially that of Toledo,
very large and even. Which indeed
is necessarie, here in regard
of the multitude of
Coaches that passe to and
fro. The Houses are very uniforme,
built flat, at the top to
walke on, a notable convenience
in these hot parts.
         Another like accommodation
which this City hath, against
the heats is the Mole, which is
like an Artificiall street casting
it selfe into the Sea, hither all
the Gentry at the evening retire
to take the Fresco.
         At the end of the Mole is the
Fanal, and underneath a fountaine,

with the statues of the
old Dieties of Parthenope.
         From thence one hath in
view the mountanous Iland
Capreas, the delight of Tyberius.
         Amongst the Palaces of Naplee,
the Vice Kings then Duca
d' Arcos is the fairest. There
are three Castles, S. Elmo above,
Castel nuovo, Castello del Ovo
below. The Churches are generally
the best I ever came into,
fild with Marbles, chiefly
the Carthusians, the Jesuits,
the Bishops Chappell.
         The onely Antiquity within
the City, is at the Theatins
Church, which was a Temple
of Castor and Pollux, the Frontispiece,
or Porch of ancient
Pillars, with a Greek Inscription
over it (which Language
this City spake when it was

cald Parthenope) as likewise
the remnants of their two Statues
yet standing; The Inscription
is this.
         
            .
         It beiug May while we staide
at Naples, We saw the famous
Miracle of the bloud of Santo
Gennaro, carryed in procession.
         Naples is extremely populous,
and consequently vitious,
he that desires to live a retired,
or indeed chaste life must not
set up there; as the gardens are
fild with Oranges, so the houses
want not for Lemmon.
         
            
Jusque datum Sceleri, saith
the Poet.
         There were at my being there
thirty thousand Courtesans
Registred, that paid taxes for
their pleasure.
         The things within Naples,
are not to be omitted, yet those
about give farre more satisfaction;
and truly if a traveller
Hyperbolise in any part of his
voyage of Italy, the most fit
Theame he can take, are the
Wonders a little distant from
Naples; and first the Tractus
Puteolanus scatens hominum ac
naturae miraculis.
         Parting for Pozzuoloes, on
the left a Suburb by the Sea
side leads to the Margouline,
where in the Church cald Santa
Maria Del Parto, is the Sepulcher
of Sincerus Sannazarius,
with many figures of Marble

excellently cut, and this
Epitaph.

         Returning back a little, wee
came to the entrance of the
famous Grotte, over which on
the left hand, stands Virgils
Tombe upon a high rock, so
that it is scarce to be seen by
those that passe below, The
Guides commonly shewing a
false; wherefore some few dayes
after we walkt up into it.
         Over the Dore of the Garden
you passe through to it, is

this Inscription on a Marble.

         Having read this we went into
the Tombe, now of this Forme
and scituation. As in the page
following.

         This Tombe of the Prince of
Poets is built in a Rotunda, or
Cupola, about five paces long,
within, the walls are of Bricke,
in square after the Roman way,

the outside is of Massive stone,
all coverd now with Bushes, amongst
which three or foure
Bay trees, (an immortall Embleme
of the Prince of Poets
there interd) shoot forth about
the height of a man, round it
lye scatterd ruines, that testifie
its former beauty, In the rock
just opposite to the entrance,
where his knowne Epitaph of
Mantua me genuit was, that being
decayed, is plac't a Marble,
stone with these verses.

         The Crypta Neapolitana a
perfect signe of the Roman
Magnificence is the rockie
Mountaine Pausylippus, cut
through, very high, spacious▪
and well pav'd, so that for the
space of a mile, two Coaches
may goe on Front under earth▪
in the midst is a Madonna, with
a Lampe perpetually burning,
the words at the Incounter
are Alla Marina, Alla Montagne.
         At the going out of the Grotte,
wee strooke towards the
right, and arriv'd at the Grotta
del Cane, which hath some innate
property, to kill every
living thing that enters, if not

speedily cast into the lake Agnano,
15. paces distant. We saw the
experiment, (as for the most
part it is shewn) in a Dog,
which seem'd to loose his vitall
force by degrees, but afterwards
being throwne into the
Lake, reviv'd.
         Hard by are the Stowes of
San Gennaro reasonable hot,
with the odour of Sulphure.
         Hence turning to the left, we
came to Capuchins, and saw
the stone whereon San Gen
naro was beheaded, with Nasita
a Mountaine in the Sea, and a
little towards the right hand,
is the Sulphatara, or hill of
Brimstone, on which no grasse
or hearb growes, but tis all
white with ashes, it still casting
out of severall holes a continuall
smoke, with Flame, making
the very earth to boile.
         
            
The ground is hollow underneath,
and makes a hidious
noise if strooke upon with a
Hammer, or the like. These
hills were cald by the ancient
Leucogei; Campus Phlegraeus,
and Forum Vulcani, whose
Kingdome (if in any part of
the world) is here about, the
Fire breaking out even in the
high wayes. Here they compose
Medicinall Pots of Brimstone.
         Advancing forward, into
the Suburbs of Pozzuoles, wee
saw an Amphitheatre, and Ciceros
house, cald Academia.
         Afterwards being come to
the Port, wee tooke a barque,
to passe over the bay, which is
round about, fild with remnants
of those Romans magnificence,
that liv'd there.
         The first place wee saw after

wee were set to Land, was the
Mercato del Sabbato formerly a
a Cirque; and the buriall place of
the ancient Romans.
         From thence we past through
the Elisian Fields (as they call
them) a plaine spot of Earth,
between the Mount Misenus, &
the Augustins Convent of twenty
Acres, and came to the ancient
Misenus, so cal'd from
the Trumpeter of Aeneas there
interd, the old Poets cald it A
erius, because of the many
Sotteran Caves in it; of which
many are yet to be seen.
         The chiefe is the Piscina Mirabili;
before which is the
Mare Mortuum. This Piscina
cald mirabili, because of the
wonderfull art tis built with,
was a reserver of fresh water
for the Navie, which, (because
this stands so neare the Sea) was

brought sixtie mile. It hath
eleven Pillars in the length,
foure in breadth, about foure
and fourty in all. The materiall
tis plaisterd with, in the inside
is as durable as stone, yet
no man knowes of what it is
compos'd, some conceive it to
be of the whites of Egges, and
dust of Marble mingled together.
         From hence leaving Lucullus
his house at the left, wee went
downe into the Cento Camerelle,
or Nerôs hundred Chambers,
where hee kept his Prisoners,
a most hidious place.
         Below that towards the Seaside
is the Temple of Hercules,
the place where Agrippina, Neros
Mother was kild, the Pescheries
of Hortensius, Tacitus
his sons house, with many other
ancient fragments which we

saw though with much paines.
         From thence we tooke boat
for Baia, where the Castle built
by Charles the fifth of France is
strong, going thither we could
discerne the foundations of
Cimeria, and old Baia underneath
the Sea, with the Via
Consularis overwhelm'd by
the water, and on the shoare
nothing but ruines.
         Hereabouts Caron was feign'd
to passe with his Boate. Here
we set againe to Land, and saw
the Temple of Venus, the Sepulcher
of Agrippina, with diverse
figures, and her Pallace
of the same worke. The Temple
of Diana at the left, the
Bathes of Trullius; The houses
of Marius Pompey, Nero standing
aloft.
         Hereabout the Sea water is
naturally hot: Hard by we went

into Ciceros Bathes, as gallant
and entire an Antiquity as any
in the Tract of Pozzuolo; These
waters were so soveraigne, not
many years since over most diseases,
that over every Bath
was written for what cures it
was good, of which Inscriptions
some letters yet stand, but
the Physitians of Palermo (as
they tell the story) finding those
waters prejudiciall to their custome,
went with instruments
expresly, and demolisht those
writings (so that for the present
they are unusefull) the said
Physitians, being all cast away
in their returne.
         From these Bathes we went
up to the Stowes of Tritola extreamely
hot, even to Suffocacation,
yet contrary to the
Grottadel Cane, that choking
below, and harmelesse above,

these coole and refreshing below,
but almost stifeling above.
         From thence we took horse,
and past by the Lacus Lucrinus,
the greater part whereof is now
coverd with the Monte Nuovo,
which mountaine (as their tradition
is) was rais'd in one
night, a mile high, from the
ashes which came out of Sulfatara,
and so coverd the Lucrin
Lake. Tommaso Fonnare an
old man of Pozzuolo, that dyed
three yeares since remembred
of that mountaines being
made in one night a hundred
yeares agoe.
         After that wee rode to the
Lake Avernus, where abouts
was the Poets Acheron or descent
into hell, at one side of
the Lake is the Temple of Apollo;
at the other, the Sybilla

Cumanas Grotte. Tis very spacious,
at the end is a Magnificent
ascent where the Oracle stood,
with the way that lead to Cuma,
Her bath yet stands, and her
Chambers painted in Mosaick
worke, yet all under ground,
as indeed most of the aforesaid
Antiquities (excepting the
Temples) are.
         In returning to Pozzuolo,
we saw the Mount Gaurus, from
whence came the best Falernum,
now cald Barbaro, it being altogether
sterile. In Puteoli there
are some Antiquities, as the
Temple of Neptune, &c. In the
Port are the vast ruines of Caligulas
Bridge, which past three
mile crosse the Sea, from Pozzuoles
to Baia.
         After dinner wee went back
to Naples, In the way wee saw
the Lions, Austriches, and other

wild beasts and fowles, that
a certaine Prince keeps.
         Having repos'd a day after
this troublesome, yet satisfactory
voyage of Pozzuoles, the
next morning wee set out of
the quite contrary part of Naples,
to see that Miracle of Nature,
the Brother of Aetna, Vesuvius,
so famous for its last eruption.
         On the way, almost at the
foot of the mountaine, (a Marble
frame which are usuall on
the high wayes, in the Kingdome
of Naples) relates this.

Upon this Hill, or (changing
a Letter) Hell is a goodly
Countrey for the space of foure
mile on all sides, which formerly
produc't the excellent Graeco,
made barren, being coverd
with a matter like Seacole Sinders.
Going up higher tis hidious
to behold the deep cracks
in the Earth, through which
the streames of Sulphure past,
all about lyes scatterd the severall
materialls it cast forth;
Some like mettall, other like
Pitch, Brimstone and the like,
with such vast stones, as (I
speake the least) foure porters
would not able to carrie one of
them
         Being come so neere the top,
as we could with our horses, we
were forc't to alight, and to
crawle up the steeper part,
which is all coverd with a reddish

substance, that sounds like
earthen vessells, some conceive
it to be Pumie stone burnt, after
this wee got up though weary
to the top; where the Vorago is
so terrifying a spectacle, that if
I would paint Hell, this would
be the best Patterne; It is a hole
about three mile in compasse,
and about halfe as much in
depth, in the midst is a new hill
that still vomits thick smoke,
which the fire within hath rais'd
within few yeares, it daily increaseth,
and when tis growne
to a fuller Bulke caveat Neapolis.
         Pliny the Naturalist too Inquisitive
after the cause of this
intestine fire chang'd lives with
Death on this Mountaine.
         In returning, as we were tir'd
in getting up, so wee went easily
down, though almost up to

the knees in ashes.
         This Mountaine was the Ʋltima
Meta of our voyage to Naples,
wherefore having with
much content seen these wonderfull
things of Antiquity,
Nature, and Curiosity; after
some few dayes we parted from
Naples to Rome, treading the
same path we had before trac't,
At our going out of the Kingdome,
they made us pay five
times, for our Vallees, although
they could finde no prohibited
goods; At our entrance they
let us passe quietly, without
paying a farthing.
         All the way to Rome I saw
nothing observable, but what
I had before spoken of, onely
I would not omit the great
quantity of Bufferos (Beasts
which furnish the Souldiery
with their skins) that we met in
the Countrey.
         
            
The day after our returne to
Rome, wee walkt to San Sebastiano,
where a mercenary Fryar
let us downe into the Roma
Sotterranea, or Rome under
ground, those hallowed Cavernes
where the Church in her
Infancy shelterd her selfe from
persecution; there is a most immense
Folio out on this Subject.
Tis now indeed a City for the
Dead, where in every street are
pild gradually one above another,
the Corps of Martyrs, to
which some Monuments are
added with no other Epitaphs
then this, Pro Christo.
         This place is as stupendious
for the rarity as venerable for
the Antiquity: The natives of
Rome know not how farre these
Vaults continue under the
Earth; yet some miles they say
are already discoverd, with so

many Maeanders, that hee who
adventures to enter without an
experienc't Guide may (as some
French men did) goe into his
grave living, yet increase the
Bill of Mortality.
         From thence wee went into
the Transtevere, saw first Montorio,
formerly the Janiculum,
and the Chappell where (ut
aiunt) Saint Peter was crucifified.
In the Church lies buried
the Count Tiron Oneille of Ireland,
who comming to Rome
in devotion dyed, very poore,
yet for his good service in the
Catholique Cause, hath a
Tombestone with this Inscription.

         From thence wee went
down into many rich Churches,
where the Primitive Christians
were martyrd; In one to wit,
Santa Maria Transteverana is the
Fountaine of Oyle that arose,
at our Saviours birth; Some
stones that were tide at the Martyrs
feet when they were
drown'd, with other manner
of Torments that they were put
to; In the same Church are very
rare pillars of Porphyre, and
other stone taken from Aurelians
baths. Thus every day produc't
a new sight to us, but I
would not passe by our Voyage
to Tivoli, which was as followeth.
         Setting forth out of Rome, at
Porta di San Lorenzo five miles

from the City, we saw a Bridge
over the Teverone, built by Mamea,
the Mother of Severus; A
little forwarder the Sepulcher
of Valerius Volusi, and ancient
Tombes without number; On
farther theres a place cald Fide
nates, and a Sulphurious River,
A Bridge cald Ponte Lucano,
and an ancient Tower garnisht
with Inscriptions, that stands
for the Sepulcher of Plautius.
         When wee were come to Tivoli,
wee went to see those wonderfull
Eliziums, which the
Cardinall d' Este at most Royall
expence hath there in possession;
the sight whereof in my
Opinion, may at this present
draw as many to see Tivoli, as
Rome with all her Merveiles.
         This shall be my patterne for
a Countrey seat; All Regale,

and therefore I'le not omit any
Particular.
         First tis evident, the Hill was
made even, and upon that Piazza
this Pallace was erected;
which is built of square stone,
and all things answerable to a
Kingly Grandezza.
         At the right hand are those
Gardens which they call the secret,
in which there are sixteen
huge Lavers of Marble, that
cast forth Chrystalline water,
in the midst of these stands a Janus
Quadrifrons higher then
those, which makes foure more
fountaines that resemble Looking
Glasses.
         At the left there's a sumptuous
Place for all manner of
Exercises, or Turnaments. The
Facciata or Front hath between
the Windowes many ancient
Statues, and so the first Porch

with most ample steps in the ascent
to the Palace.
         Before this, theres a most
glorious Fountaine, with the
Statue of Leda; And foure
vast and most delicious gardens
in view.
         Passing down the steps which
have Piles of Water on both
sides, amongst the Groves theres
these Fountaines of Tethys, Esculapius,
Arethusa, Pandora, Pomona,
and Flora. Afterwards
theres the stately Pegasus in
Pamossa. The two Colosses of
the Sybilla Tyburtina, and Melicerta.
The Cupids powring
water out of their Flaskes are
most ingenious, next there
are some Urnes, upon which
stand ten Nymphes, and in the
midst the Caves of the Sybilla,
Tiburtina, and Diana, Goddesse
of the Woods. Both aadornd

with fountaines, statues,
Roots of Corall, Mother
of Pearle, and pav'd with
Mosaick worke.
         On the other side of the Garden
sets Rome triumphant, in
the midst of her most Memorable
Fabricks, as the Pantheon,
Capitoll, Cirques, Theatres,
Amphitheatres, Obelisques,
Mausoleos, Archs Triumphall,
Pyramids, Aquiducts, Porticos,
Thermas, and the like. Neither
is the River Tyber wanting;
for out of the Wolfe and
Twinnes gusheth a Rivolet,
proportionable to that Representative
City.
         In the next garden theres the
Ʋccellario, where amonst the
Branches of Trees, Artificiall
Birds move their Wings and
sing sweetly; on a sudden an
Owle appears, and they change

their Melody into a chattering
admiration.
         Not farre from thence is the
Fountaine of Dragons, which
vomit forth the water with a
most horrid Noyse.
         The Grotte of Nature where
the Organs play most harmoniously
by the motion of Water.
In the garden that followes are
diverse Lakelike conservatories
of Fish, with Swans, here the
Mete Sudanti, the Ocean with
Neptune in his Charriot on Sea
Horse are most stupenduous.
In the last the Triton and thousand
exotick Plants are to bee
seen.
         Tyr'd with these Master-Pieces
of Art, wee went to that
Naturall Cascata, or Cataract
at Tivoli, which is made by the
precipitious fall of the River
Anien from the Mountaines, it

rusheth downe with that Fury,
that there is still a thick mist over
it, and by the Reflexion of
the Sun ariseth a perfect Rainbow.
         Pliny mentioneth this River
to have that Innate Quality to
Petrifie the ground it passeth
through, or any thing that lies
long in it. The Sulphurious
streame I above mention'd
flowes from this.
         Neere to this is an old Temple,
some say of Hercules, others
adjudge it to the Sibylla Tyburtina,
or Albunea, and the more
propable, for Tivoli was anciently
Tybur. Horace and many
of the Roman Magnates had
their Villas here, of which they
shew their Ruines, as likewise
the Sybilles Cave.
         Returning for Rome, one
may discerne Preneste, and a

little out of the way, on the
left stands a huge moles of Antiquity,
the Villa Hadriana,
the heap rather of a City then a
House, tis reported hee had
there the most eminent buildings
of the World taken from
the Originalls, but
         
            —Jam seges est, ubi Troja fuit.
         
         I have been long in the Transaction
of these things, in and about
Rome, and now end somewhat
abruptly, the diversity of
things, makes my memory treacherous,
I can onely say
         
            Roma Capo e Compendio del
Mondo
            A cui non e cosa simile ne seconda.
            Rome of the world Compendium
and Head
            Admits no like, nor can be seconded.
         
         
            
The heats growing on at
Rome, wee left it to set up our
station for the Summer at Sienna,
and having already seen
Caprarola, wee went with the
Procacccio, so that passing to
Viterbo by the Strada Nuova,
wee saw some remnants of the
Via Cassia, with Soutry where
Orlando Furioso was borne, and
the ruines of Gharlemaines Pallace.
         At the great Inne at Radicofany,
wee met the Marquis de
Fontenay, the French Embassadour
in his voyage to
Rome.
         A week after our arrive at Sienna,
was an Opera represented
on the new Theatre of Prince
Matthias, with severall changes
of Sceanes, as a Garden, Sea,
Pallace, and other Machines, at
which the Italians are spoke to
be excellent.
         
            
All the time of our stay at
Sienna, I fild my bookes more
with observations of the Language,
then of the people, City,
or Country: Onely the diversity
of fruits which are every
day brought to Market; and
sold at a low rate, argues much
the fertility of Italy, as well as
the great quantity of silke it
produceth, and therefore deservedly
cald Bombycina; In
June was the silke Harvest, If I
may so call it, and there was
such abundance, that in England
I never saw so much Woole, as
I did here Silke.
         The ninth of July the Sanesians
solemnizd a feast, but sore
against their wills, for Cosmus
the Duke of Florence's taking
Sienna.
         In August on the feast of the
Assumption of the Virgin, was

a Race of Barbaries, which ran
without Riders from one gate
of the City to the Princes Pallace,
for a Pallium of Cloath
of Gold.
         The same Moneth wee went
to the Jewes Synagogue, and
saw the Circumcising of a
Child. Which the sacred Page
describes.
         September the seventh wee set
from Siena, to begin our returne
towards France, our first dayes
journey reacht to Florence,
where tarrying one day, the
next wee parted with the Procaccio
for Venice, paying seven
Crownes a man.
         Six miles up the Apennin we
past by Pratolin, a famous seat
of Pleasance belonging to the
great Duke; and about as many
miles farther wee dind at Il
Ponte, before which lies a most

delicious Valley, environd with
very high mountaines.
         After dinner, about two miles
farther, wee past through Scarperia,
from whence we mounted
more and more up the Apennins,
The way in some places
but streight, & on the right hand
is a very steep Precipes down to
the plaine below. All that afternoon
we rode up and down
hills, which are as much fruitfull,
as barren, and at night we
lodgd at Fiorenzuolo, a Fortresse
which stands in the midst
of the Mountaines, at the confiues
of the great Dukes Territoire.
         The next morning departing,
long before break of day,
(as the Procaccios in Italy usually
doe) we perfectly discernd
the flame of Pietra Mala, a
Mountaine at the highest part

of the Appinines, which perpetually
burnes.
         All that forenoone wee had
a tedious passage through the
Chesnut woods, till wee came
unto Pianora, where having
dind, by a suddain descent passing
a Torrent divers times, wee
snk into the fertile and pleasant
plaine of Bolonia, and so to
the City it selfe, where we prevaild
with our Conductor, to
stay the rest of that day, and
halfe the following, that wee
might take a more full view of
this famous City of Bolonia,
the second in the Stato della
Chiesa.
         It is situated at the foot of the
Appenins,Bolonia the neighbouring
Countrey producing so great abundance
of things necessarie
to humane life, that it hath got
the name Bolonia the Fat.
         
            
For strength it is not much
considerable, there being but a
single wall without Bulwarks,
Ramparts or the like, Tis a fiter
habitation for the Muses,
then for Mars, the fame of that
University which flourisheth
there, making this Motto common,
BOLONIA DOCET.
         Amongst the things I tooke
notice of at Bolonia, the first is
the generall uniformity in the
buildings, there running before
all the houses, a very stately
Cloyster, with Arches all of the
same structure, so that a large
street appeares one building,
which manner though it differ
from the ordinary Italian way,
yet is no lesse admirable
         Amongst other faire edefices
of this City, the Popes Pallace
very spacious, is chiefe, over
the Gate is the statue of a Pope
in mettall.
         
            
Before this Pallace is the Piazza,
as remakable as most in
Italy: In the midst stands a very
sumptuous Fountaine, where
the Brasen Neptune made by
John of Bolonia, a famous Sculpturer
is very considerable, at
one end of this Place is the Dome,
not yet finisht.
         The great Schooles are said
to be as stately as most in Europe.
And likewise the Hospitalls
are worth seeing The Convents
at Bolonia are generally
very glorious, especially S.
Dominick, and out of the Town
S. Michael in Bosco.
         In briefe, the Bolonians agree
with the other Italians, in having
their houses built decently,
and in their Courts, still
have some Verts set, as Orange
trees, Cypresses, or the like,
which much pleaseth the eye

of a stranger, as he passeth the
streets.
         In the heart of the City, stands
the Tower of the Asinelli:
(cald so from a Family that
rai'sd it) some making Bolonia
to represent the forme of a ship,
set this for the maine Mast. It
is growne somewhat to decay
through time, and the staires
are very rotten, however, wee
adventurd to goe up to the top,
and from thence wee had a full
view of the Towne below,
with the streets lying in a
straight line, as likewise a
faire Prospect on the plaines of
Lombardy.
         On one side of this Tower,
is another cald Garisenda, which
seemes to fall much after the
manner of the Campanile, at
Pisa, some impute it to the
Architecture, others say it was

of the same height with that of
the Asinelli; but the Citizens
fearing it would fall, pull'd
downe the upper part, and left
the rest standing crooked, as at
the present it doth.
         This is the summe of what I
saw in Bolonia, yet berore I
went from thence, I tooke a
taste of those famous Saltsages,
that are compos'd at Bolonia,
the which are transported
thence, not onely into other
places of Italy, but also into
diverse parts of Europe, as a
rare and costly dish, which
addes and maintaines her Epithite
Bolonia La Grassa.
         Leaving Bolonia for our
more free entrance into the
State of Venice, wee tooke a Bill
of Health.
         The first day we past the Canall,
that goes to Ferrara, having

our boate drawne by a
Horse, in which way we went
through about nine Sustegne,
Machines not much unlike our
Sluses, to keep up and let down
the water for the turning of all
sorts of Milles, and the passage
of Boates.
         Towards Evening wee past
by Bentivoglio, a Castle that
gave denomination to the learned
Cardinall of that name.
         Some two houres later, wee
came to Mal Albergo, an infamous
Inne, both in name and
in deed, where having poorely
supt, wee imbarqu't in another
lesse Boate, and having past
all night through the fennes,
The next morning we arriv'd at
Ferrara.Ferrara.
         
         Ferrara heretofore a Dutchy
by it selfe, yet now subject to
the Apostolique See, is more

considerable for strength, then
beauty, however it is in Italy,
and therefore (secundum nos)
no meane City.
         Its scituation is on a plat, so
that by it runnes two Channels,
the one towards Bolonia, the other
towards the Po, it is fortified
with very faire Ramparts,
upon most of which are planted
Allies of trees.
         Within the Towne are some
faire buildings, as the Palazzo
del Diamante, belonging to the
Duke of Modena, the Castle
where, in the Court are pictur'd
the Dukes of Ferrara, and tis
said that at the last, there was no
Roome left for another
         Before the Pallace are two
small Statues of a Marquis, and
Duke of Ferrara; many other
things are observable, as the
Epitaph of the famous Poet

Ariostus, and of many other
famous men buried there,
which my short stay would not
admit me to collect.
         Our Inne was the Angelo (a
too sumptuous edifice to have
been made a Taverne) where
having dind, wee went by boat
downe the Channell, and about
three mile beyond Ferrara came
into the Po, which is the greatest
and farthest navigable river
in Italy, for breadth and length
much above Tyber it selfe; the
ancients cald it Padus, the Poets
Erydanus, on the Bankes
whereof they feignd that, Io
transformd into a heifer was
want to feed.
         About evening wee came on
the confines of the Venetian territoire,
and supt at Corbua, a
place three miles distant from
that most ancient, yet now dejected

City Adria, which formerly
gave the name of Mare
Adriaticum, to the Sea now cald
the Golfe of Venice.
         Three miles farther, wee
changd our Barke for a bigger
Vessell, to carrie us to Venice,
and having now past thirty
miles on the Po, we came suddenly
by an artificiall cut into
the River Adice (Athesis in Latin)
that passeth by Verona;
and the next morning, about
the opening of the day, wee
enterd into the Golfe, passing
by Chioza, a City in an
Island on the left, Palestina on
the right, with other Islands
that lay rang'd in a row to Venice
it selfe, where, wee arriv'd
the twelfth of September; and
being come to the Port, wee
(as the custome and order is)
were not permitted to set foot

on shoare, on paine of death,
till wee had a ticket of licence.
         Venetia,Venice. is a word never heard
of in the Romans dayes, the
originall of this name being not
above thirteen Centuries of
yeares since, yet Historians generally
report, that at the decay
of the Roman Empire,
when the invasion of the Hunns
and other Barbarous Nations
overspread Italy; Some provident
Fishermen began to build
Cottages in those scatterd Islands,
and in processe of time,
others for their better security
retyr'd thither: From this
poore, and low beginning (imitating
her elder sister) is shee
growne to that height, that all
deservedly call her Venice the
rich.
         This very mirrour of State
and Policy, as shee was borne

about the death of old Rome, so
shee seemes ro bee hereditarily
Possessour of that which maintaind
Rome in her soveraigne
glory; The magnificent Genius
of the People, the Gravity of
the Senate, the solidity of her
lawes, very much consonant
with those of Rome.
         Hence Venice hath this propriety
above all other States;
that she is a Virgin, (a cōmodity
rarely found within her self)
and more, from her first Infancy,
Christian: having never yet
fell from her principles, either
in Government, or Religion;
but still valiantly defending her
Liberty against the insulting
Mahomet.
         Besides the wise and Judicious
Potentates, that strengthen
this Common-wealth, Nature
hath fortified her with a

strange and unusuall scituation
         
            —Mediâ insuperabilis undâ.
         
         Environd with her embracing
Neptune; to whom, (as the
Ceremonie of throwing a ring
into the Sea implies) she marries
her selfe with yearly nuptialls.
         Hereupon our English Martiall
admiring the scituation of
the Magnificent Venetians City,
sayes to them
         
            Quid mirum est vestram consistere
Legibus Ʋrbem
            Legibus exleges cum teneaatis
aquas.
            No wonder if by Lawes your
City stands,
            Since out-law waves are chain'd
to your Commands.
         
         If some casuall necessity did
not constraine men to build Venice,

I could never conceive
how so stately Pallaces, how so
compacted a City should stand
in the midst of the Sea.
         The particularities whereof
are these. I may begin with the
Piazza San Marco, the Center
whither an infinite number of
Persons, from divers parts of
the world in diverse habits;
still tend: The Platforme thereof
somewhat resembles a Carpenters


square, the
uniformity in the
buildings, and other
embellishments, speaking it the
fairest in Italy, I thinke I may
say in Christendome.
         At the end just before the
Chiesa San Marco, are three
Standards with Pedestalls of
Brasse, very exquisite worke.
         At the right side from these,
is the Clock-house, adorn'd

with the signes of Heaven, with
the Sunne and Moones monethly
entrance to them, and two
Statues of Brasse that strike.
         Saint Marks Church is not
so admirable for vastenesse, as
for the rarenesse of the designe,
and precious materialls it is
compos'd of.
         The whole facade, or Frontispiece,
is beset with Pillars, of
Serpentine and Porphyre, towards
the top stand foure horse
of Brasse, most worthy Trophees,
taken (as some say) by a
Stratageme, out of Constantinople.
And first stood in an Arch-Triumphall
at Rome. Amongst
the imagiry worke on this
Church, there stands a woman
stroking a Dog; The Venetian
Annals mention the story, of
a Senators Daughter, who
(her Father altogether, depriving

her of society with
men) had a prodigious Birth
by that over familiar Play-fellow.
         For the inward part of this
Temple, It is a little obscure
within, yet most richly wenescoted
with Marbles, and the
whole top coverd with lively
pieces in Mosaick worke: An
Art lost or unknowne in these
parts, and highly valued there.
         Neere that Church gate, that
lookes into the Sea, is a little
Chappell, and therein is an ill
hewd image of the Lady, made
(as their Tradition goes) out
of the same rocke, which Moses
strooke when the water miraculously
gushed forth; And to
make good this story, they
shew three little holes out of
which the Fountaine came
forth. Some probability there

may be of this, an old and now
scarce legible Greeke Inscription,
on the same stone beginneth
thus—
         
            .
         And underneath these Latine
words,
         Aqua quae prius ex petra miraculosè
fluxit oratione Prophetae
Moysis, producta est, nunc
autem haec Michaelis studio labitur,
quem servas Christe &
Conjugem Irenem.
         The construction is dubious
the lines verbatim, as there I
found them.
         In this same Church is kept
with great reverence, the body
of the Cities Protectour Saint
Marke, whose winged Lion with
the Motto, Pax tibi Marce Evangelista

meus, is the Banner
and Armes of this Commonwealth,
In honour of this Saint,
here is likewise conservd a most
inestimable treasure.
         To this Cathedrall Church
joynes the Dukes Pallace wholly
of Marble, with a Kingly
Arcade of three and thirty Pillars,
under which, tis a most
comely sight to see the Venetians
in their long Gownes, daily
consulting of State affaires.
         Just against the great Gate, at
the top of the steps, stand two
Colosses, the one of Mars, the
other of Neptune, works of famous
Sansovinus. Opposite to
these staires is a Facade of Statues,
both ancient and moderne.
         Above is a most royall Corridor;
wherein are divers Tribunalls,
or Courts of Justice,

and higher are most gallant ascents
into the Senate house, and
other sumptuous Halls.
         Below in the Court, in going
out, I observd the mouthes of
two Wells in Brasse, of very singular
art.
         On the other side of the place
is the Zecca, where they coine
money, and the Procuratorio;
on the top of this structure
stand five and twentie Statues.
         On the seventeenth of September,
whilst wee were at Venice,
there was a new made
Procurator, (the second man in
the Republick) enterd into his
office, at which solemnity wee
saw the Senatours in their robes
of Scarlet, Damaske, three hundred
most grave, proper persons,
every one speaking himselfe
no lesse then an Embassadour

in his deportment.
         The following morning, the
Secretarie of the State, of the
Family of the Tommasini, for
appearing a favourite to some
Banditas, was privately strangled,
and his body afterwards
hung up in the place of execution,
which place brings mee
againe into my description, it
being Between the two Pillars
that stand towards the Canale
della Giudeca. These two Colomnes
were brought out of
Greece, on the one stands the
Statue of Sanct. Theodorus, with
the Crocodile, on the other
Saint Markes Lion of Brasse.
         This is the summe of what is
to be noted within, and about
the Piazza San Marco, yet before
I leave it, tis worth the
paines to get up Saint Marks
steeple, which stands by it selfe,

eightie feet distant from the
Church.
         From thence one may discerne
how the City lies compacted
of many little Islands,
separated by Channells, joyned
by Bridges, the number
whereof, if well reckoned up,
comes to foure hundred and fifty,
and the greater part of stone.
The fairest and most remarkable
is the Bridge of Rialto,
which, though but of one Arch,
yet for the height, length, and
breadth, hath no where a parell.
         Upon it stand twelve shops,
at each side coverd all alike
with lead, and behind magnificent
Balustrades. This Bridge
passeth over the Canal Grande,
along which are the most stately
houses in all Venice.
         It is a most satisfactory

sight to behold the Corso in this
Channell, every Feast towards
the Evening, to see the Venetian
Ladies habited like
Nymphs, and the Gondola's
like so many Daulphines running
a race. These Gondolas
are Boats, which because of
the little use of walking a foot
there, are still carrying some
passenger one way or another.
Every noble Venetian keeps
one of these Seacoaches for his
family, and others there are to
be hir'd by any man for money
very genteel and commodious.
         Hence one may easily conjecture
how populate Venice is;
for the number of Gondolas is
40000. so that in case of necessity;
the Boatmen would make
a considerable army, for every
Gondola hath a Rower, and the

better sort too. And now I am
on the water, before I set foot to
land, I may visite some of the
neigbouring Islands, and first
Murano a mile distant from Venice.
         Here continually (excepting
in August and September) are
Fornaces to make Glasses,
which for the variety of the
worke, and the Chrystall substance,
exceed all others in the
world, and are transported to
all parts: out of which merchandise
Venice drawes infinite
summes of money.
         In returning wee stept into
the Arsenall, The Magazine and
store-house of Warre, Mars
his warehouse. In this place the
Republick hath all ammunition
for Sea and Land, all instruments
of offence and Defence,
all preparations for shipping so

ready, that tis said they can
raise a Gally in foure and twenty
houres, and though the late
approach of their common enemy
the Turke, hath much impoverisht
this Arsenal, yet the
daily labours of Artisans that
worke there, still restore it.
         The next day wee went to
the Greek Church, where at
their service in their owne
tongue, there was a great Congregation,
who us'd more Ceremonies,
but lesse superstition
then the Church of Rome,
which calls the Greeks Schismaticks
onely, because they
differ not much in exteriours
from them; but will not acknowledge
the Pope to bee
head of the Church.
         Neither have the Orientall
Christians alone this Liberty at
Venice, but Loyalas Sonnes being

exild thence, the Inquisition
reacheth not so far as strangers,
which made us Hereticks
(as they call us) thinke wee
were come out of the Land of
Bondage, to a more secure
Country.
         The day following wee made
a Gondola carry us over to San
Georgeo, an Island with a most
beautifull Monastery; The
Chappell is pav'd (as generally
they are in Venice) with a reddish
Marble, About the Coire
are very rare Statues, and in the
Cloister, sits Venice Triumphant.
         From thence wee went to
San Giovanni e Paulo, more in
devotion to the living Ladies,
then to the dead Image there
worshipt.
         This Place is much frequented
by the Venetian walking
May Poles, I meane the women,

which gives mee occasion to
speake of the common habits or
fashions of Venice.
         The Citizens rich and poore
follow all the same Mode, viz:
A long black gowne with wide
sleeves, and a kinde of skirt to
throw over one shoulder, the
collar alwayes open, and a
Black Cap edg'd with Fringe of
Wooll.
         The Ladies have found out a
devise very different from all other
Europaeian Dresses. They
weare their owne, or a counterfeit
Haire below the shoulders,
trim'd with gemmes, and Flowers
their Coats halfe too long for
their bodies, being mounted
on their Chippeens, (which are
as high as a mans leg) they
walke between two handmaids,
majestickly deliberating of every
step they take.
         
            
This fashion was invented,
and appropriated to the noble
Venetians wives, to bee constant
to distinguish them from
the Courtesans, who goe coverd
in a vaile of white Taffety.
These fashions, because they
are not so variable as ours, I
have here inserted.
         Before the Church I last mentioned,
San Giovannie Paulo is
a Cavalier, or horseman in
Brasse, with these words.

         This is the chiefe of what I
observ'd in three weeks residence
at Venice. As concerning
the trade, or traffique of this
City, shee is without Doubt,
Mistris of all others; it is shee

that makes rise or fall the Exchange
at her pleasure.
         And this I imagine proceeds
from the great and innumerable
company of Jewes, that are harbourd
here, and that enjoy the
Priviledge of a Synagogue for
every Nation; so that in their
Guetta they have nine diverse
ones, yet weare they a Badge of
distinction, viz: a Scarlet hat.
The shops at Venice are most
richly furnisht with Easterne
Merchandize, as Sattins, Damasks,
Cloaths of Gold, with
a world of costly Drugs, which
word intimates I must hasten to
the Medicinall Padua.
         From Venice to Padua, because
of the convenient passage
by water, is one easie dayes journey.
         About five miles from Venice
wee came to Liza Fusina, where

the continent or firme Land
beginnes, here one finds commodity
of going either by Land
or Boate, wee tooke the latter;
a most delightfull Spasso on the
river Brenta, which runnes in
so direct a line, that one may
see its course foure miles behind
or before one, on both
sides is a garden-like countrey,
and a multitude of Villa's, or
Countrey houses, with Gardens
of Orange trees, and other
greens after the Italian
way. At the close of the evening
wee arriv'd at Padua.
         Patavium was founded,Padua. long
before Romulus suckt the
Wolfe, Tis reported that Antenor
flying with some force into
these parts, after the destruction
of Troy began this name
and city; to confirme this, they
yet shew this Noble Heros

Tombe, with this Epitaph in
old Characters.
         Inclitus Antenor Pat: &c.
         The words are these.
         
            C Inclytus Antenor Patriam
Vox Nisa Quietem,
            Transtulit huc Henetum Dardanidumque
Fugas,
            Expulit Euganeos, Patavinam
condidit Ʋrbem;
            Quem tegit hic humili marcaesa
Domus.
         
         The Monument whereon
these verses are ingraven stands
by S. Lorenzos Church, in this
figure. As in the page following.
         
            
            
               Antenors Tombe

               
            
         
         Not farre from this Marble
Chest, are some remnants of the
walls that Antenor laid; For
the city is divided into the old,
and the new, the old hath round
about it the river, both are encompast

with strong Bullwarkes,
upon which are planted
rowes of trees, very pleasant
to walke amongst, though
they quite hinder the view of
the city a farre off.
         Neither indeed (I must confesse)
doth Padua abound with
stately houses, like the other
chiefe Cities of Italy, yet those
renowned disciples of Aesculapius
that are nourisht there,
make it to be said both at home
and abroad, Padua the Learned.
         It stands in a most delicious
and fertile Plaine, which produceth
so great abundance of
things necessary to humane life;
that the vulgar Proverb goes
Bolonia la grassa ma Padoua la
passa.
         By reason of this plenty of
provisions, and the daily practise

in Physick, and the other
liberall Arts this city is no lesse
frequented by strangers, then
Athens anciently was.
         And indeed those who have
been students at Padua, have
reason to commend the place,
for by the Senate of Venice's
constitution (under whom Padua
is) every Nation, English,
Dutch, &c. hath a Consul, enjoyes
many Priviledges, and by
their matriculation may lay in
provisions, without paying any
excise or taxation.
         This liberty is very prevalent
to draw Forreigners thither,
yet the ill Government
of the Schollars there much disswades
others from likeing the
place.
         It is strange to finde Minerva
so joynd with Mars, to see students
in so warlike a posture, for

the common mode of the
Schollars is to goe arm'd with a
paire of Pistolls, and a Stilletto
by his side, this they say proceeds
from some old and inbred
dissentions between the Vicentines
and Brescians, which two
parties so fill the towne with
slaughter, that no man can
walke the streets late at night
for fear of their Chi-va li? and
which is a more manifest signe
of their Barbarismes on the
Pillars of the Porch, or Arches
that runne before the houses of
this city, one may discerne
where Bullet have past; nay, so
triviall is homicide amongst
them that if at any time they
want a body for the Anatomy
Lecture, they make it a small busines
to kil a poore fachin, or porter
to put his body to that use.
         Notwithstanding these grosse

abuses, yet Padua is a very worthy
University. It was Vacation
time when wee were there,
however wee stept into the
Schooles.
         Over the Gate is the Lion
San Marco, and this Inscription.
         
            Sic ingredere ut teipso quotidie
doctior, sic egredere ut indies Patriae
Christianaeque Reipublicae
utilior evads. Ita Demum Gymnasium
a se feliciter Ornatum existimabit.
            MDC.
         
         Within is a square Court, the
building two stories of Pillars,
one over another, and round about
in every corner are the
Armes of all such as have been
Consulls in that University;
Some in colours onely, others
in colours and stone, with the

countrey, name, and yeare;
all which is made at the expence
of the Venetian, to make
famous this nursery of learning.
         Above is the Anotomick
Theatre a very neat, and singular
invention; commodious
both for the Professour, and his
Spectatours.
         Not farre from the Physick
Schooles is the Palagio della Ragione,
or Hall of Justice, which
considered as an upper Roome
is the fairest and most spacious
in Christendome. Some impose
more on the excellency of this
Fabrick, then can be discernd
by a common eye, alledging
tis plac't to the foure parts of
the heaven, so that in the Equinoctiall
the beames of the Sunne
rising, entring at the East windowes
strike those at the West,

and in the Solstice, the rayes
that come in at the South,
touch the opposite window, in
a word, there is no part without
some Astronomicall secret.
The pictures represent the influence
of higher bodies on
these below. It is coverd with
lead, round about goes a stately
Corridor of Marble.
         Over every dore, is some Remembrance
of those men who
for their Birth have celebrated
Padua. Amongst these is that
immortall Treasure of History
and Eloquence, Livie. In
whose never fading memory
there is, (at one end of this hall)
a monument erected, and this
old inscription added thereunto.

         There is likewise a Poeticall
Elegie, but I passe by this new
monument, with all the appertenances
of the same, to come
to Livies old Tombe, which is
there extant in this forme. As
in the page following.

         To this Westminster Hall at

Padua, joynes the Podestas Pallace.
         The Podesta is he who represents
the Senate; and executes
their power; In most of the cities
under the State of Venice there
is one. There is likewise a Capitan
Grande. He lookes after
the military affaires, the other
the Politicall.
         Many houses in Padua are
worth seeing, as the Captaines
lodging in the Piazza.
         At the Palazzo di Foscari all
Arena, are some Vestigia of a
Theater.
         In the Garden of Mantua are
divers singularities; Amongst
others a huge Colosse of Hercules,
with these words.
         
            Hercules Buphiloponus Bestiarius,
Qui tristitiam Orbis depuli
omnem Peramplo hoc signo Mantuae
cura reflorescat.
         
         
            
One day walking to some of
those places, I espi'd a good faire
Chappell put to no better use
then a Barne, asking the reason,
twas told me it had been a Jesuites
Church; an argument that
those Religious States-men are
not welcome where the Venetians
sway the sword; neither indeed
have the Loyalists one
Colledge in the Venetian Cities.
         As for the Churches of Padua,
that of Saint Anthony deserves
the first place. Before the dore
is a Man and Horse of Brasse,
within is a most precious Altar,
under which lies the body of S.
Anthony, about is his life and
miracles in figures of Marble,
cut by the most famous
Masters of those times, or (I
thinke) that ever were, or will
be.
         Hard by this Church is Il prato

della Valle a Medow, at the end
whereof stands that most wealthy
and Kingly Convent of S.
Justine, the best and stateliest I
can remember I sawin Italy. The
Chappell is an incomparable
piece.
         In the Cloysters an Antiquary
might spend a yeares study;
for amongst the Legend stories
design'd on the walls, they have
inserted hundreds of old Inscriptions,
with the Draughts of
old stones, and pieces of Urnes,
all which were dug up out of
the ground, when the Foundations
of this Convent were first
laid
         A little farther is the Physick
Garden, fild with simples, but
the Euganean Hills furnish Padua
more abundantly with medecinall
Herbes.
         These hills are in view from

Padua, and have been alwayes
famous for the Medecinall
Bathes, that proceed from them.
         Having spent a week in Padua,
the Gentlemen wee left at
Venice, came thither (viz: Sir
J. G. a Northerne Baronet, and
my Lord B. his eldest Son) with
whom wee joynd company to
goe thorough Lombardy, and so
over the Alpes into France.
         From Padua we hird a Coach
to Verona; In our first dayes
journey we had nothing to observe
but the Fertility and pleasantnesse
of the Country, neither
could I imagine my selfe any
where but in Lombardy.
         Had not the People, Language,
Manners, seemd Italian,
I might have thought my selfe
to have been out of Italy; so
great an alteration is there in
the Landskip betwixt this, and

the other side of the Appenines.
         The meliority of either I dispute
not, they being equally
good, yet contrary, that mountanous,
this flat. The latter is
cald Lombardy, and under that
name is comprehended the
whole plaine betwixt the Alpes,
and the Appenines.
         It was almost Vintage time
when wee past through this Paradise,
and it made my journey
much easier, to see the trees
rangd in order so farre as one
can see, to looke on the Vines
embracing the Elmes, with such
an incredible quantity of grapes,
that they are coverd more with
Purple, then green.
         Et Tellus Bacchi pondere pressa
gemens.
         Besides this wee lodgd every
night in some memorable City,
where wee sound good accommodation,

and something observable.
         The first day some houres before
it grew darke, we were in
Vicenza.
         Vicenza,Vicenza. in Latine Vicentia,
was according to Livie built by
the Galli Senones in the Reigne
of Tarquinius Priscus, since that
time it hath without doubt sufferd
many changes.
         It is now under the Venetians,
and stands in the Marquisate of
Treves. It is neither fortified, nor
capable of Fortification, it being
situated at the bottome of a hill
that commands the Towne,
however the fidelity of the Inhabitants
keep it in safety.
         The Vicentins delight to goe
abroad in the world, to see forreigne
customes (an humour seldome
found in other Italians)
so that at their returne home

they live splendidly, goe richly
appareld, keep many followers;
for which cause this city is reputed
very full of Gentry, & those
rich, the common title to a
Gentleman here being Signor
Conte, as much as my Lord.
         Neither are they lesse noble
in their Buildings then in their
Garbe; for by the art of Palladius,
the late Reviver of the Roman
Architecture a Vicentin,
this city is beautified with stately
Pallaces publick, and private.
         The Hall of Justice is admirable,
both for the Ancient and
moderne structure, the Tower
lofty, the Piazza most capacious
of Turnaments, and other
assemblyes of the Gentry, Who
are much given to shewes and
Pastimes; and to this purpose
they have erected a Theatre, the
figure whereof I conceive to bee

like those of the ancienr Romans,
though the materialls differ,
Palladius was the Inventor,
as this Inscription over the
stage, testifieth.
         
            Virtuti ac Genio.
            Olympior: Academia
            Theatrum hoc a Fundamentis
erexit.
            Paladio Archit:
            Anno 1584.
         
         It will hold five thousand
persons, the Scene is very well
contrived with Statues, and
Corinthian Order, the Prospective
represents a Kingly City.
         Diverse like places of recreation
there are, within and about
the City, amongst which is the
Campo Marzo made in imitation
of that, anciently at Rome,
for to exercise the youth in
Chevalry, thither the Ladies

and Gallentry of the City resort,
in the sommer Evenings to
take the Aire.
         The Arch or entrance into
this Field will stand as a perpetuall
monument of Palladius
that built it.
         Just opposite is the Garden
of Connt Valmarana, wherein
the close Walke of Citron and
Orange trees, together with
the Labyrinthe are things very
commendable.
         Going forth at the gate di
Monte, one sees another Arch
of Palladius, with a most high
paire of staires to the top of the
Madonna Del Monte.
         Halfe a mile farther by the
river side (which river was in
Latin cald Meduacus Minor) is
the Rotonda of Conte Mario
Capra so cald from the Cupola
at the top, or likenesse it hath

with the Pantheon at Rome,
though in my opinion it more
resembles the Temple of Janus
Quadrifrons, for it hath foure
faces and foure Gates.
         Palladius made this his Master-piece;
for tis so contriv'd,
that it containes Geometrically
a Round, a Crosse, and a
Square.
         The Master of this house
uses all strangers very civilly.
His Sellars are the best, and the
best furnished I met with, neither
is he sparing of his Wines
to Travellers; As wee were returning
from this house to our
Inne, wee met with him and his
followers attending him, one of
them who spake French sayd,
his Master desir'd to see us at his
house to morrow, but our short
stay would not permit us to accept
of that kind invitation, I infer

this passage to shew the generous
Minds of the Vicentines.
         The next morning wee left
Vicenza very early, dind at Osteria
Nuova the midway: And
about foure in the afternoone
wee came unto Verona.
         Tis the vulgar Criticisme on
this Name,Verona. that if it bee syllabizd,
it comprehends the first
letters of the three head Cities
of Italy Ve-Venetia. Ro-Roma.
Na—Napoli. Others leave
the verball dirivation, and more
strictly interpret it, that whatsoever
is containd in those three
Cities may bee found in Verona.
         Her wealth may be compar'd
to that of Venice; Her Monuments
of Antiquity equall even
those of Rome, neither is
the delightfull situation inferiour
to that of Naples.
         
            
Thus much I must needs say,
were I to see Italy againe, I
should make my Station at Verona,
for I know no place more
agreeable or commodious for a
stranger.
         The City stands one part on
the side, the other at the foot
of a hill, behind which is a
continuation of huge Mountaines.
         Before one side of the City
lies a rich Plat Countrey; Before
the other a stony Champion,
or Downes, wherein C.
Marius gave a totall overthrow
to the Cimbrians.
         The River Athesis divideth
the City in the midst. Thus
nature hath adornd Her, neither
hath art been wanting to
glorifie her, and this one may
collect from the mighty remnants
of Roman Magnificence,

that yet stand within her walls.
I may say with Martiall,
         —Ʋnum pro cunctis fama loquatur
Opus.
         Of the Amphitheatre at Verona,
the most perfect that is to be
seen this day in Christendome,
the figure whereof I have here
set downe. As in the page following.
         
            
            
               The Amphitheatre at Verona
Arena
            
         
         
            
This noble worke was spoild
of all its ornaments by the Barbarous
that sackt Italy, yet one
may easily judge, how betwixt
the Arches and the Columnes
there were statues.
         In the circuit of this Moles
are three Porches, one within
another, made for the Spectatours
to goe in, and out without
disturbance to any one In the
midst is the Arena, where the
Combatants fought in an ovale
forme, foure and thirty perches
long, large two and twenty, environed
with two and forty
seats, which lie gradatim, one
above another, still extending
to the top.
         In these Cirques the vastnesse
of Marble stones is incredible,
so bigge that one cannot
conceive how they were transported
thither.
         
            
This worke was perfected by
L. V. Flaminius Cousul Anno
Ʋrb: Cond. 53.
         Many other signes of Venerable
Antiquity are there in Verona,
as Arches-Triumphalls,
ruines of Temples, Aquiducts,
Urnes and the like. There's one
Arch Triumphall dedicated to
Marius for his victory over the
Cimbrians.
         And although this City bee
not now of so great a compasse
as Historians report, it was in
the height of the Roman Empire,
yet the Venetians have
with great expence joynd new
Bulwarkes and walls unto the
old, and it is fencd with three
Castles, which make it as well
impregnably strong, as delightfull.
         The buildings of this City are
answerable to the Italian.
         
            
The fairest is the Councell
house, upon the roofe whereof
stand expos'd to the open
ayre the Statues of Cornelius
Nepos, Emilius Marcus, old Poets.
Pliny the Naturall Historiographe,
Vetruvius the Architecture,
all which men graced
their native Verona by their singular
Vertues.
         Besides these, the Learned
Scaliger was of Verona, for
whose sake and his Family i
Signori della Scala, there is (in
the heart of the city, before the
Inne wee lay at Il Cavaletto) a
stately Tombe of Marble, encompast
with Iron worke, in the
fashion of a Ladder, which that
name implies.
         These things wee saw before
it grew darke at Verona, which
wee left the next morning, having
renewed our bargaine with

the same Coach that brought
us thither, to carry us to Milan.
         At our going out of the
Towne, I saw a Porphire
Tombe in a Church yarde, twas
told me that a King of the Goths
lay buried there. Looking into
the River Athesis, I espied a
Bridge of old Roman work, and
some Engines which convey
water out of the river in to the
city by Pipes.
         When wee parted from Verona,
and indeed through all the
Venetian State, our Matriculations
wee had from Padua did
us much service, for by that
meanes none of the Guard,
would dare to hinder us as
they usually doe strangers.
         Two miles beyond Verona
wee past over the Downes, memorable
for the Battells of Marius.
About noone wee came to

Cavalli Caschieri, an Inne two
miles short of Peschiera, which
is a most strong Fort of the Venetians,
standing at the Embushment
of the Lago di Garda into
that of Mantua.
         The greater part of the afternoone,
wee past by the side of
the Lake, which by the Ancients
ws cald Benaca. From Peschiera
it extends it selfe towards
the North five and thirty miles.
Tis very rough and tempestuous,
as Virgil saith,
         
            Fluctibus & fremitu assurgens
Benaca marino.
         
         Which I believe proceeds
from its enclosure, between
mountaines which stop up the
winde, yet being fenct so with
Alpes which keep of the Northerne
blasts, and warmd
by the reflection of the Sunne,

those hills produce great store
of Olive, Citron, and Orange
trees.
         The Lake abounds with fish,
especially with Troutes, equall
to them of the Lake of Geneva,
which wee tasted of that night
at supper at Lunato.
         In the midst of the Lago di
Garda, is an Island wherein
stands Sermonea.
         The next day wee had very
bad Coach way, yet at dinner
time wee were at Brescia, where
because of bad weather wee tarried
that day.
         Brescia,Brescia. (by the Romans
Brixia) may be cald the Venetians
Magazine, here is a perpetuall
appearance of Warre
though they live in peace, every
shop is stord with Armes; In a
word▪ the chiefe traffick of this
place are Swords, Muskets, and

other military Engines, from
whence tis vulgarly cald Brescia
the Armed.
         It hath a plaine on all sides,
excepting towards the Castle
which stands on Hill; behinde
which are very high Mountaines;
By reason of this vicinity
to the Hills the City is
beautified with many Fountaines,
a commodity which few
of the Cities in Lombardy have.
         In some of the streets there
runnes Porches, whereby one
may walke drye in rainy weather.
The Torre della Pallada is
of rare Tuscan structure, the
Piazza is but little, yet the
Towne house may be reckoned
amongst the fairest of Italy
         The Dome was a repairing
when I was there. In that is
kept a skie colour Crosse, which
they hold to be the same which

appeard to Constantin.
         There is little observable,
(onely some Churches) at
Brescia; which we left the next
morning, and dind at Ʋrsa Vecchio;
after dinner wee past by
Ʋrsi Novi, a strong Garrison in
the Venetian Frontiers that
way.
         A little farther, having past
the river Oglio, we went by Soncino,
the first place where wee
saw the Armes of Spaine over
the Gates, a signe wee were
come into the State of Milan,
but wee soone were out of it
again, for that night wee lay at
Crema, which is under the Signory
of Venice: It stands in a
plaine very well fortified with
Ramparts and a Mote. The
Dome, the Tower, the Place,
and the Podestas Pallace are
worth seeing.
         
            
The next morning foure
miles beyond Crema wee enterd
into the State of Milan, and
past by Lodi, a great City on
the side of the River Ada,
this City is famous, for the
cheeses made there which are
not much different from the
Parmisano, Lodi was cald by the
Romans Laus Pompeia.
         From Lodi wee went to dinner
at Marignano ten miles
from Milan; All which way
the Countrey is more Gardenlike
then in any part of Lombardy,
the high wayes are as streight
as one can imagine, on both
sides runne Channells of water,
on both sides trees planted, and
in the fields there is Corne,
Wine, Fruits, and Medowes
altogether, till wee came to the
very gates of Milan.Milan.
         
         Milan for the mighty circuit

of her walls, the great number
of Churches, is before any other
City in Italy said to be the
Great.
         The Metropolis of either
France, or England, either Paris
or London, goe much beyond
it for bignesse, yet they
must be lookt on as Heads of
Kingdomes, this as the Capitall
of a Dutchy or Province, besides
their chiefest greatnesse is in
their Suburbs, Milan hath none
at all, but lies within a stately
wall of ten miles compassc.
         Tis plac't in a wide plaine,
and hath about it green Hills,
delightfull Medowes, Navigable
Rivers, and enjoyeth a
wholsome Ayre, the territory
doth so well furnish it with all
necessary provisions, that tis
worth a dayes journey onely to
see the Market of Milan.
         
            
Neither doth it want Trade
to support it in a flourishing
condition, for tis so throngd
with Artisans of all sorts, that
the vulgar Proverb goes
         
            Chi volesse Rassettare Italia rouinarebbe
Milano.
         
         For the Antiquity of this place
Mediolanum its ancient appellation
speakes it old, and some
pieces of Roman edefices, yet
standing there confirme the
same.
         Before San Lorenzo's Church
stand sixteene Marble Pillars, a
a remnant of the Temple of
Hercules, at one end of them is
this Inscription put in.

         Since Milan shooke off Paganisme
to imbrace the faith
of Christ, that glorious Pillar
of the Church, Saint Ambrose
was her Bishop. To whom
there is a Church dedicated vulgo
Sanct' Ambrogio.
         Under the high Altar supported
by foure Porphyre Pillars,
is interred the body of
Saint Ambrose; tis beleev'd
that Saint Ambrose stood at the
gates of this Church, when
he excommunicated Theodosius
the Emperour, and would not
suffer him to enter therein.
         Hard by is a poore Chappell
in a blinde corner, with a Well,
where Saint Ambrose baptiz'd

Saint Augustine, and began the
Te Deum, as the Inscription on
the wall witnesseth.
         Hic Beatus Ambrosius baptisat
Augustinum, Deodatum
& Alippum, Hic Beatus Ambrosius
incipit Te Deum laudamus.
         
            Augustinus sequitur
Te Dominum Confitemur.
         
         This place is so meane, and so
little regarded, that tis very
probably true; for tis incredible
how the name of Carolus
Baromaeus a Councell of Trent
Saint, highly cryd up at Milan,
hath extinguisht the memory
of that learned Father.
         In S. Eustorgios Church is to
be seen the Sepulcher wherein
lay the bodies of the three Magi;
the bodies were transported to
Colen in Germany, but there

remaies the Tombe in this
forme.
         
            
               SEPVLCHRVM TRIVM MAGORVM
            
         
         Most of the Churches in
Milan deserve the eye of the
curions, yet all may bee included
in the Dome or Cathedrall,
for the Fabrick; the most like
ours of any I saw in Italy; yet
for the materialls more costly.
         Tis all of white Marble, and
about it, are five hundred Statues
of the same. The Addition

that is now in building is very
glorious, especially for the
huge Pillars of Granito, a sort
of Marble very common at Milan.
About the body of the
Church, are set up pictures of
the miracles wrought by Saint
Charles Barromee. And in a
Chappell under Ground is devoutly
worshipt the body of
that new founded Saint, with a
Treasure of rich presents.
         As these divine buildings are
glorious, so the private mens
houses of Milan are not inferiour
to those of other Cities in
Italy; The streets are of a more
then common breadth, and there
are very many gardens within
the walls.
         The fairest Pallace in Milan
(I may say in Italy) is the great
Hospitall, a square of Columnes
and Porches six hundred Rods

about; fitter to be the Court of
some Kings then to keep Almes
men in; yet no use can it be put
to better then to feed the Hungry
and cloath the naked.
         Next to this I reckon the Castle
accounted by all Engineers
the fairest, the strongest
Fortification or Citadell in Europe.
They are very cautelous
in letting strangers to see it, to
cast an eye on the outworkes is a
crime, wherefore I omit any
farther description.
         Foure dayes past while wee
were visiting these things, I
have set down at Milan. After
this repose, wee began to bethinke
our selves of the laborious
taske we had to undertake,
to get over the neighbouring
mountaines the Alpes.
         Milan is the rise for two passages,
either by mount Goodard,

or Sampion, the first is through
Switzerland, tedious and long;
the other is through Valesia
more delightsome, and short.
         Wee meeting opportunely
with a guide who had been conversant
in the way by Sampion,
made our agreement with
him, that hee should beare all
our charges, for horse, Diet,
and lodging, till wee came to
Geneva, wee paying him eight
pistolls a man.
         
            The passage over
the Alpes.
            Our first dayes journey to
Sesto at the foot of the Alpes
was by Coach, wee dind in the
midway Alla Castellanza; Three
miles short of Sesto, tis very
remarkable to see how on a suddaine
the Alpes break off the
flat Countrey, like a wall to

part Italy from her neighbours
France and Germany.
            Thereabouts wee had in full
view the Mount San Bernardo
Il grande, the highest Terrasse
in Europe. And wee could perfectly
discerne it about foure
English miles to out top the
Cloudes.
            That night wee lay at Sesto.
The next morning before break
of day, wee tooke boate to passe
over the Lago Maggiore (in Latine
Verbanus Lacus) so cald not
that tis the biggest amongst the
Alpes; but because the River
Ticinus passeth through it into
the Po, so that all Merchandise
is thereby transported out of
Helvetia, Six mile beyond Seflo,
wee past by Arona a strong
towne in the Dutchy of Milan,
three yeares since besieged by
the French; it stands on the

side of the Lake, and against
it is Angiera.
            All that morning wee had a
pleasant passage going Terr' a
Terra, till about three in the afternoone
wee came to Marguzzo
a poore village at the end of
the Lake.
            Here began the difficulty of
our voyage, wee could see nothing
but a Series of Rockes,
heapt to the skies upon one another,
yet to get over wee are
constraind.
            From Marguzzo wee had
horses to Duomo, that forenoone
was not so tedious as wee
expected it would have been,
for wee rode rather through
then over the Mountaines in a
very fruitfull though narrow
valley.
            Having dind at Duomo wee
changd horse, and so the way

required; being mounted we
presently got two miles higher
where wee met with extreame
hazardous way, and deep Precipices
to boot. (Believe mee
Hanniball had a most hard taske
to lead an army over the Alpes
—Difficilis est ad Astra Via.)
            Our horses though tract up in
those pathes, seemd to tell their
steps and pick out their footing;
however in this slow pace wee
got safe to Vedra sixe mile beyond
Duomo, the last village in
Dutchy of Milan.
            The next morning about
three mile farther, wee enterd
into the Paese de' Valesi; a most
barbarous disconsolate place, a
Habitation for Wolves and
Beares.
            Our terminus Visus was most
hideous Mountaines, coverd
with snow, on all sides terrible

Precipices, monstrous Rockes,
passages over narrow Bridges,
Cataracts of water, tumbling
downe with such noise that wee
could not heare one another
speake.
            This strange and unusuall
Landskip continued not above
five houres, but presently wee
met with a new People, a new
Phisiognomy, a new genius, a
new Dresse, a new Language.
Yet the first words wee heard,
wee even understood Com Heyn
Gots name, and Got tanke
heir.
            These Monticoli are in all
things consonant with the Switzers
stout, lusty fellowes, yet
very dull and ignorant.
            They weare long Breeches,
and rough Bands, their
tongue is a broken Dutch. That
which they are most commendable

for is their Honesty, a
man may travell over all their
Country with Gold in his hand.
Their women speake more of
the Male then their owne, the
female sex.
            Having with much paines,
yet delight, because of the
variety, crouded through
some of the Alpes, wee came
to dinner at Sampion, at the top
of the Mountaine, to which
that Village gives the denomination.
            This mount Sampion was by
the Latins cald Mons Sempronius
            After dinner we had the hardest
part of our journey to passe
over, and then wee were worst
of all provided; the poverty of
the place could not afford us
either Saddles or bridles to our
Jades, yet necessitie drives and
away wee must.
            
               
Wee were now at the very top
of the Alpes; nothing to bee
seen but snow, which hath laid
there beyond the memory of
man, and as some say ever since
the flood.
            There are Poles set up to direct
the way to passengers, yet
in the very path our horses went
so deep that few or none of us
scapt without a fall.
            In some parts of the yeare, as
December, January and February
this mountaine is impassable,
The best time is in September,
October or November.
            After wee had past over the
snow which was but for foure
mile or thereabouts, wee were
forc't to alight, to crawle down
the steeper part of the Mountaine;
When our Guide desird
us to horse againe, it hapned
one unruly Jade broke loose and

ran away. Twas my ill Fortune
to be set upon a Mule, an untamable
headstrong beast, which
seeing the other Horse, a great
way before, ranne headlong up
and downe, and carried the Rider
over such terrible places that
all the company gave mee for
lost: When the horse and
my Mule stayd of themselves
my fellow Travellers, overtooke
mee, so that evening wee
reacht to Briga, at the bottom of
the Sampion which was the end
of our Alpine voyage.
            Hereabouts the Rivers, the
Rhene and the Rhosne, have
their fountaines but neither are
Navigable.
            The rest of our way to the
Lake of Geneva, was amongst
Alpes but not over any. There
running along a rich valley between
two huge Mountaines.
            
               
From Briga wee lay the next
night at Sion (Sedunnm in Latine)
being from Briga six Switzer
mile, thirty Italian.
            Sion is the head City of Valesia,
the Bishop hath both the
Spirituall and Temporall Jurisdiction.
From Sion wee lay at
Martigni. The next morning
wee past by Saint Mauritz, a
little farther wee went through
a gate that divideth the Vallois
from the Dutchy of Savoy:
wee dind at Montei, and in the
afternoone wee came to Boveretta,
and there hir'd a Boate, to
passe by the Lake unto Geneua.
            The Lake of Geneva, heretofore
Lacus Lemanus is held to
be the biggest in Christendome,
on one side it hath the Switzers
and France, on the other
the Savoyarde, and at that end
where it looseth it selfe in the

Rhodanus stands the City that
christens it Geneva, where wee
arrivd the sixteenth of October:
the eighth day from the time
we sate out of Milan.
            GenevaGeneva. (ancienty head of the
Allobroges) would bee but an
obscure Towne were not Fame
her friend. Yet is she placed in
such a corner of the World,
that she seemes to lye Geografically
in the Center between
Germany, France, and Italy.
            For this reason tis suppos'd
Master Calvin began to preach
up his Reformation, in this
City before any other, not
through any splendour in the
place, but that some might come
from all parts to follow his Doctrine.
            And now by Gods protection
I am in no Roman, though
Catholicke state, no Inquisition

to lay hold of my words, or
writings; I may set downe that
which a Marble Table hath in
letters of Gold, on the Towne-houseat
Geneva Thus.

Before their eyes were opened
by Master Calvins Sermons,
The Motto of the Genevists
was Post Tenebras spero Lucem,
since it is alterd to Post Tenebras
Lux.
            God will confound great
things by small, else tis miraculous
how those seeds of the
Gospell, which were first sow'd
in this Towne, should spread
it selfe into many parts of the
world Maugre Rome and her
adherents.
            This advantage Geneva hath
by its situation, the better sort
speake or understand any of
these three Languages, French,
Dutch, Italian, so that every
weeke there are Sermons in
them all. Amongst the Divines
of Geneva, Deodatus is their
great Patron, a great Schollar,
and a pricking thorne in the Jesuites
sides.
            
               
For the Ecclesiasticall Government
of Geneva, it is Presbyterian
such as Calvin instituted.
For the Politicall, I conceive
it to depend on Aristocracy.
            Their State (excepting some
private men) hath hardly
wealth to subsist, yet every Citizen
will lay downe his life and
meanes for to maintaine their
Cause, and Liberty.
            They keep contiauall watch
and ward, and not without
reason for their owne territory
about the City, exceeds not the
Lands of many Countrey Gentlemen
about their houses.
            The Savoyards very often
make suddain Incursions, so
farre that they shewed us where
they once had scal'd the Walls,
but were repulst.
            Yet if the Duke of Savoye prohibit

his Subjects to carry Provisions
into Geneva. The Genevists
presently can sallie forth,
and take their Cattle or the
like by force. For there is no
Castle neere to counterpoise the
strength of Geneva. Besides
this, in cases of necessity they
have the three Protestant Cantones
to help them, with whom
they are confederates, as this
Inscription standing in the
Towne house witnesseth.

            There is little remarkable in
the City except in the Townehouse
there are kept fourteen
Urnes, which were dug up as
they were raising the workes of
the City. S. Peters Church is
their chiefe.
            The houses in Geneva are generally
well built, but through
most of the streets is a Timber
worke very offensive to the eye,
for it hinders the view of the
houses, neverthelesse tis convenient
to keep out raine. The
greatest Merchandise Geneva
sends to other parts is Bookes

of all sorts. This is the summe
of what I tooke notice of in
those few dayes I spent at Geneva.
            From thence I made the
quickest dispatch I could to Paris,
and so to my Native home.
But tis now high time to set my
last period to this Itinerary of
my Italian voyage.
            FINIS.
         
      
      
         
         
         AN
APPENDIX
ON THE
Same Subject.
         FOr the Readers fuller satisfaction;
and to leave
no part of this Empresse
of the World undescribed; I
have here annexed a captiulation
of those Places which I casually
omitted to see, partly
collected from my discourse
with Italians, partly from my
converse with forreigne Authors
of this nature.
         In my first Digression the City

Lucas is most obvious.
         This Republickes dominions
lie Promiscuously in those
of the Duke of Florence's, and
containe not above two dayes
journey in circuit, yet the vigilancy
of the State under his
Catholike Majesties Protection,
defends their Liberties against
all Opposers.
         To maintaine their freedome
more powerfully, the Luchesi
have reduc't this City to
that strength as few in Italy can
equall it.
         It stands on a flat some few
miles distant from a Branch of
the Appenines.
         The compasse is but small (as
Places of most hard accesse alwaies
are) the whole not exceeding
three mile; which is inclos'd
and fenc't with gallant
Walls and eleven Bulwarkes.
         
            
There is little observable
within the City except the Pallace,
Counsell-Hall, Arcenall,
and in the Dome the Volto Santo,
which (pardon the tradition)
was set miraculously on an
Image of our Saviour, carv'd
by Nicodemus his Disciple,
whilst the Artist was surmizing
after what forme to expresse
that sacred face.
         The Inhabitants are very affable
to strangers (as I have
been informd) so that some
chuse to stay there, and their
Language is much consonant
with the Sanesian.
         The Territory of Luca by the
Country mans industry, abounds
in fruits, Olives especially,
which are famous here
with us.
         Out of Luca towards Pistoia,
in the high way there runnes a

Rivolet of salt Water, and
from the same Source (as is
imagind) issue those Renowned
Bathes; to goe to which
from Luca one passeth, over
the River Serchio upon two
Bridges of admirable Structure.
         Advancing towards Rome, tis
worth stepping out of the way
to Perugia, and Orvietta Both
under the Patrimony of Saint
Peter.Perugia.
         
         The first Perugia gives Denomination
to the Lacus Thrasimenus,
though six miles distant.
Here precisely was fought that
memorable Battell Between
Hanniball and the Romans the
latter routed.
         Perusia stands on a high hill,
hath but poore Walls, the Citadell
well fortified, the Fountaine,
the Popes Pallace, and

the Schooles deserve seeing,
yet I heard of nothing more remarkable
there, then the delicious
muscatelle Wine.
         Orvietta is a great Towne on
a Mountaine too; There is in
this City one most singular Piece
to satisfie Curiosity, and that is
the Well, made so that they
goe down by one side and come
up the other; It hath a hundred
and fifty staires, and seventy
Windowes. The Dome is such
as all Italy hath few the like,
tis built of Pietra Teverina,
and on the Front are most exact
Ouerages of Marble.
         In or about Rome I know no
place I mist, excepting Bagnaia
on this side and Albano on the
other; the latter deserves seeing,
if not for the Antiquity, yet
for the good Wine; one of the
best sorts in Italy.
         
            
However Florus saith Alba
Latii Caput before Romulus had
laid his Cities foundation: Besides
the Tombes of Ascanius,
and of the three Horatii yet
stand there.
         There are many Ensignes of
the Romans greatnesse, and
places often cited amongst ancient
Writers; As Canna, Sulmo
Ovids Towne, Brundusium,
with many others towards Calabria,
but few or none steere
that course.
         Those that make the circuit
in Italy, far il Gyro as they say
goe to Venice by the way of Loreto.
         Between Rome and Loreto one
passeth by divers Remnants of
Antiquity, as first the ruines of
Otricoli, then Narnia, which
Martiall Describes thus.
         
         
            Narnia Sulphureo quam Gurgiti
Candidus Amnis
            Circuit Ancipiti vix adeunda
Jugo.
         
         Out of the Towne there are
most huge arches of a Bridge
standing over the River, made
by Augustus out of the Sicambrian
spoyles, the Reliquiae declare
it to have been the worke
of some flourishing Empire.
         'Tis of Marble, One Arch
though not entire is two hundred
foot broad, a hundred and
fifty high, nor can I thinke
Martiall spoke of any other
Bridge in the precedent Epigram,
which hee concludes
thus.
         
            Sed jam parce mihi, nec abutere
Narnia Quinto.
            Perpetuo liceat sic tibi Ponte
frui.
         
         
            
There comes an Aquiduct into
the City fifteen miles in
length, at the embushment are
three faire Fountaines of
Brasse.
         Beyond Spoleto runnes the
River Clitumnus, the water
whereof the old Poets feign'd,
made the Oxen that dranke of
it, white, as Virgill in his Georgicks
         
            Hinc albi Clitumne Greges &
maxima Tauri,
            Victima saepe tuo persusi Flumine
sacro.
            Romanos ad Templa Deûm
duxere triumphos.
         
         Keeping on the Via Flaminia
you come to Foligni, of old Forum
Flaminii; some step out
of the way to Assisa famous for
the birth of Saint Francis, institutor
of the Capuchian Order:

but the nearest is to goe to Recanati
and so to Loreto.
         Great was Diana of the Ephesians,Loreto.
great is the Lady of
Loreto. Loreto is of it selfe but
a little Bourg or Village, yet
by the noise it makes through
Christendome, especially in the
Catholike Regions, tis as much
frequented as Saint Peters
Chaire. Hee's no zealous Romanist
that hath not made one
pilgrimage thither, or sent some
Offering to the Virgin here ador'd.
         The Church is on an Eminence;
In the midst with great
reverence is kept the Cottage or
chamber (as they tell) where
the Virgin Mary liv'd and conceiv'd
her heavenly Offspring.
The house is environd with a
case of Marble most curiously
workt, their Legend runnes

that this lodging was brought
out of Palestina by the Angels,
and plac't here at the Adriatick
shoare: Why not at Rome I
wonder? To confirme this
story they shew the Window
where the Angell enterd at the
Salutation.
         Here is without dispute the
greatest Treasurie in Christendome,
and is daily increast
by new Oblations from Catholike
Princes. Which the Turks
and other Pyrates well know,
and would make incursions
were the place as weake, as it is
little.
         Though little it deserves a
longer survey then my speed
will admit. I passe now towards
Ravenna, and first Ancona presents
it selfe to my view.
         Ancona the greatest maritimate
under his Holinesses Jurisdiction

is mountainously scituated,
yet before hath a most capacious
and commodious Port;
ancient without any farther enquiry;
that arch-Triumphall
erected by the Senate to Trajan
is so firme and solid an Antiqual,
as Rome her selfe can scarce
shew the like, tis of Parian
Marble, each stone of a prodigious
bignesse, cimented with
no Morter, but with Lead. In
the Front these words are legible.

         Ancona gives the name to the
Country Marca d' Ancona, anciently
Ager Pisenus, all under
the Pope, though the next Cities
Senogallia and Fossombrone
belong to the Dukedome of
Ʋrbin.
         This Dukedome is at the present
vacant, both the Pope
and the Duke of Toscany lay
claime thereto, tis thought
there will be a publick Contest
shortly.
         After Fossombrone you finde
the River Metaurus and the
Via Flaminia cut through a

Rock. Ʋrbin is a City amongst
the mountaines of very
hard Accesse, Raphael d'
Ʋrbino purchast it a great fame
by his deserving Pensill, of
which many excellent Pieces
are here extant, one especially,
his owne Picture drawne by
his owne hand. The Pallace,
the Bibliotheck, and Castello
durante ten miles off may bee
seen if you have leasue. Before
the Place are the statues of the
Dukes.
         Pesaro succeeds Ʋrbin a neat
City in a plaine under the same
Duke, the Princes Pallace and
his other seats of Pleasance (but
above all Mille Fiore) deserve any
ones sight.
         The next City of Note is
Ariminum, famous for Caesars
ingression when he past the Rubicon
of which take this.
         
            
In the Piazza at Rimini, heretofore
Forum Ariminense upon
the stone whereon Caesar stood
when he made a speech to his
Souldiers.

         At the East Gate comming
from Pesaro, theres an old decayed
Arch of Marble built by
Augustus where the Via Flaminia
ended. Over the Marecchio is a
bridge began by Augustus, and

finished by Tyberius, as the title
thereon intimates.
         Arimini stands, on the seaside
but the Port is very bad, the
place is faire, grac't with the
Pope Paulus Quintus his statue
in Brasse.
         Betwixt Ariminum and Cesena
neere to Cesena on the
high way, upon a white Marble
is yet visible the Decree of the
Senate when Caesar past the
Rubicon, and sayd—Eatur
quo Deorum ostenta & inimicorum
Iniquitas vocat, jacta sit
Alea. The edict runs thus.

         This stone was restor'd Tem:
Pauli Tertii. Upon one of the
sides is writ (as may be suppos'd
by the Restorer)
         
            Quae fluit Ʋnda brevis Gallorum
terminus olim
            Ausoniaeque fuit; Parvulus hic
Rubicon.
         
         Advancing towards Ravenna
you passe by Cervia, where
before the Cathedrall an ancient
Sepulcher, made like a Pyramid
with two Infants ingrav'd
thereon is to be noted: nearer

Revenna is La Pignada that notable
Forrest of Pines which
furnisheth all Italy with that
sort of fruit.
         Revenna a City very venerable
for its Antiquity stands in a
Plat very low,Ravenna. three miles
from the Sea side; It hath one
great inconvenience, a scarcity
of good water; which Martiall
knew when hee wrote this
Epigramme
         
            Sit Cisterna mihi, quam Vinea
malo Ravennae
            Cum possum multo vendere
pluris Aquam.
         
         In the Porta Speciosa for the

At Ravenna tis worth the
paines to step into the Church
of Saint Apollinary built by Theodorick
King of the Gothes.
There are two rowes of most
noble Columnes brought by
the same King from Constantinople.
         Before the Church of Saint
Vidal there are some old Idols of
the Pagans, and in the Convent
is the Sepulcher of Galla Placidia.
         Hard by are the Ruines of
Theodoricks Pallace. In the Vessell
of a Fountaine stands a Statue
of Hercules Horarius the like
not in Italy.
         The Dome of Ravenna is very
sumptuous. The Tradition
is that, Saint Apollinary praying
God would shew some miraculous
signe to whom hee would
commit the Bishoprick of Ravenna,

at a solemne Convention,
the Spirit came downe in
the likenesse of a Dove upon
one; the Window whereat the
Dove enterd, they conserve
with great Devotion.
         In Saint Francis his Convent,
is buried the great Italian Poet
Dante, with this Epitaph made
by himselfe.
         
            Jura Monarchiae, superos Phlegetonta
lacusque
            Lustrando cecini, volverunt
fata quousque
            Sed quia Pars cessit melioribus
Hospita castris.
            Actoremque suum petiit felicior
astris.
            Hic claudor Danthes patriis
exornis ab Oris
            Quem genuit parvi Florentia
mater Amoris.
         
         These are the most considerable

rarities at Ravenna.
         I will now make a speedy cut
through those parts in Lombardy
I left out.
         Neere to Padua is Arquato,
where Petrarch liv'd and past to
the other life, they shew his
house. On a faire tombe is this
his Epitaph.
         
            Frigida Francisci Lāpis hic teossa
Petrarchae
            Suscipe Virgo Parens, animam
sate Virgine parce
            Fessaque jam terris coeli requiescat
in arce.
         
         These Cities in Lombardy, as
Mantua, Modena, Parma, Turino,
the Capitalls of foure
Dukedomes are seldome visited
by strangers; and indeed the
splendour those Princes live at
drownes the rarities of the Cities,
but I have been so superfluous

in curiosities, that I feare
Delight should turne too tedious
thererefore in brief.
         Mantua stands in the midst
of a Lake, which renders the
place inaccessable.
         There are to come to the City
two great Bridges, the one
named San Georgio, the other
Molini.
         Gradaro is a very faire Church,
as likewise the Dome, where
there's two excellent Pieces of
the Councells held at Mantuo.
         The Duke hath divers seats
and Pallaces about the City.
         As the Fontana where in a
hall there are rangd about wild
Boares Heads, that Vincenzo
Father of this present Duke
Ferdinand killed with his owne
hand.
         The Favorita and the Thea,
and above all the Hall of Gyants,

where by strange and unusuall
art, how low soever one
speaks, at the corners tis intelligibly
to be heard, and those in
the midst heare nothing.
         The Dukes Pallace is of a
most vast extent, Virgils house
is shew'd neere the City, no memoriall
but his Statue
         
            —Man tua me genuit.
         
         In the rest of the Cities of
Lombardy, there is little should
draw a Traveller out of his way
to bee seen, but the Courts of
their Princes, till he comes to
Turin the Duke of Savoys amongst
the Alpes where he may
shut this Booke.
