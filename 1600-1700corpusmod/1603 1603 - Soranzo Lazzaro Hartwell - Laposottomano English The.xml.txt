LAZARO SORANZO.
         VVherein is deliuered aswell a full
and perfect report of the might and
power of Mahamet the third, Great Emperour of
the Turkes now raigning: together with the Interestes
and dealinges which he hath with sondrie other Princes,
what hee is plotting against the State of
Christendome, and on the other side
what we may practise and put in executition
against him to his great damage
and annoyaunce.
         As also a true Description of diuers peoples,
Countries, Citties and Voyages, which
are most necessarie to bee knowen, especially
at this time of the present Warre
in Hungarie.

         TO THE MOST
Reuerend Father in God, the Lo.
Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace,
of all England Primate and Metropolitane, one
of the Lords of her Maiesties most honourable
priuy Councell, my singular good
Lord and Maister.
         MOst Reuerend father
in God, and my singular
good Lord: It
pleased your Grace
in the beginning of
Michaelmas terme last, to demand
of me a question touching the Bassaes
and Visiers belonging to the
Turkish Court, and whether the
chiefe Visier were promoted and
aduanced to that high & supereminent
authority aboue the rest, according





to his priority of time and antiquity
of his being Bassa, or according
to the good pleasure and election
of the Graund Turke himselfe:
wherein although I did for the present
satisfie your Grace to your contentment
by the smal skill & knowledge
which I haue in those Turkish
affaires: yet bethinking my selfe of
this Discourse which hauing been
by me translated out of the Italian
tongue, had passed the Print, & had
lyen by me these two years not published
to the viewe of this English
world, vpon some speciall considerations,
that moued me for the time
to conceale the same. I thought it
would bee a very acceptable and
pleasing matter now to thrust it
forth, for the better satisfaction of
your Grace and others, that are desirous





to vnderstand the ful truth &
estate of that tirannical and Mahameticall
Empire. The Booke was
written and penned by one Lazaro
Soranzo a Venetian Gentleman, in
the yeare 1598. at what time Mahamet
the thirde of that name, now
raigning, was expected to haue entended
warre vpon the State of
Christendome, eyther in his owne
persō, or by sending forth some one
of his Bassaes or Visiers to bee his
Generall in that action, whereupon
the Gentleman author of this Discourse,
beganne to enter into a very
deepe and subtle consideration of al
the designments & purposes which
the Turke and his Councell had
plotted at home, against the poore
distressed seuerall States & commō
wealths of the christian Empire: &





hauing performed the same did publish
it in print for the general plesure
& benefite both of his own country
and also of al others, that may haue
any interest in so waighty & important
a busines: In which treatise if he
haue somewhat trespassed by terms
and wordes against the Caluinists,
the error will soone be pardoned, if
we shall remember that he is but a
relator of others opinions & speeches,
though himself indeed be greatly
addicted to the popish religion,
and the maintenance thereof. It
containeth first a perfect and true
discouery of the present estate,
wherin that Easterne Empire now
standeth, together with a speciall
report of the reuenewes and forces
thereof: secondly, the particular
discourses, that were made, where,





and vpon what parte of Christendom
this war should be first attēpted:
and thirdly a most christian &
resolute aduise giuen by the author
to all Christian Princes, how they
may cōbyne & confederate themselues
togither in this sacred war, &
be able euery way to meete withall
or any of these Turkish deuises &
plots, wheresoeuer & whensoeuer
they shall be put in practise, which
aduise I wold to God might deeply
and foundly sinke into the heartes
and mindes of all our western princes,
to the end they might ioyne
altogether with prayer and force to
eclipse that cressant Moone, being
now (I hope) at the full, and according
to the Turkes owne fearefull
presages, as it is mentioned in the 83.
page of this little worke, like vtterly





to bee extinguished, whensoeuer
it shall please the Moderator of all
kingdomes to call away this present
fatall Mahamet, who dooth as yet
domineere in that vaste and huge
tyrannie. I was once minded (my
most gracious good Lord) to haue
added hereunto a more ample discourse
of the estate, forces and reuenues
of that Empire, comprehended
in a Treatise (entituled, Il Turco
vincibile in Hongheria, viz. That
the Turke is vanquishible and to bee
ouerthrowne in Hungary) written by
an other Italian Gentleman, called
Achillis Tarducci of the Marquisate
of Ancona. But the time preuēted
me, so that I could not couple
them together, according to my desire.
And therfore I most hūbly beseech
your Grace to accept of this





my poore trauell, being performed
by starts and at idle houres, which I
should & ought to haue employed
in your more serious seruices: not
doubting but that (if it shall please
God to adde any moe yeares to this
my Quinquagenarian yere of Iubile,
for which I most hartily thanke his
diuine Maiesty) I shal be hereafter,
if not more able, yet assuredly more
willing to discharge my dutie to
your Grace and my country, by doing
some further seruice, that may
be pleasing & acceptable to any indifferēt
reader. In the meane time, I
do hereby (as I am bound) wholy
deuote my selfe to your seruice, beseeching
the Almightie still to preserue
& maintaine your Grace in al
health, honor, and happines, to the
continuation of the peace of this





English Church, and the comfort
of all your friendes and followers:
Among whome I must acknowledge
myselfe, though the least
and the worst, yet in
all dutie and
affection.
         
            Your Graces most loyall, faithfull, and
obedient seruant. A. H.
            At your Graces house in Lambhith,
the first of Ianuarie. 1603.
            
         
      
      
         
         The Preface.
         EVen as for Princes that would learne
wel to gouerne and maintaine them
selues, aswell in time of peace, as of
warre, there is no one thing more
necessarie, then the knowledge, first
of their owne affaires, and next of
the state of other principalities, (as
those do write, who haue the greatest vnderstanding in ciuil
causes, & as Experience it selfe doth manifestly declare:) so
is it most fit and cōuenient for them, to vse their vttermost
care & diligence, that they may haue perfect skill & discretion
to iudge betweene truth and falshood. For if the second
part of their knowledge, I meane touching other mens states
& Principalities: (for of the first it is not my purpose to discourse)
bee not founded and established vpon truth, it will
neuer be possible that their counsailes shall sort to any profite
or aduauntage, because it is well knowne, that a false
information, either of a speech, or of an Astion, or of a
place, may oftentymes breed no lesse damage, and daunger,
then a Counseller that is either of small capacitie, or
else a lyer, or a Captaine that hath neither wisdome nor experience.
And therefore verie greatly are those Princes to
be commended, who not onely endeuour to enforme themselues
of the wittes and loyaltie of their owne seruants, but
also for the more certaintie how matters do passe in truth,
maintaine either at home in Court, or abroad in forreine





places, Men of learning, and of practise: the one for matter
of Historie, and properly appertaining to good ciuill gouernment,
and the other for the knowledge of the estates,
inclinations, designements, interests, treasures, armour,
weapons, confederacies, preparations, and all the forces of
other Princes: whereunto may be added also as a matter of
great impertance to know those Countries, which haue not
onely beene knowne many a yeare ago, but also those that
haue beene lately dicouered, or may hereafter bee made
knowne to the world. In respect whereof, assuredly aboue
all other Don Iohn king of Portugall, and Isabell of Aragon,
are most worthie of eternall memorie, for the discouerie
of the East Indies, and of the new world, which was
performed by their fauour and assistance. And the reason
of that which hath beene said, is this, touching the first,
because such matters hauing beene reported or written, for
the most part either to please, or for some aduātage, or falsly
penned by persons that neuer were present at the Action, or
for feare haue concealed the truth, their reports and writings
haue need of great caution & censure, before they be
beleeued: and touching the second, because one eye-witnes, as
the Poet sayth, is more certaine & worthy of beleefe, then a
thousand eare-witnesses, as they do most manifestly approue,
who by the view of their own eies, which they haue made in
diuerse Prouinces, do find & acknowledge, that in bookes of
Cosmographie, Geography & Chorographie, there be many
faults and errors to be noted in the gouernement of sundry
principalities, in the maners and customs of diuerse peoples,
and in the true situation of seuerall places and Countreyes:
besides many other tales and fables, which are here and
there dispersed, as well in writers of old, as in writers of late
times, and onely because the Authours of them haue written





and recorded either all these matters, or at least verie
many of them, without euer seeing any part of them, but referring
themselues wholy to the ancient descriptions, which
in deed do not fully answere to the knowledge and experience
of these dayes, and without iustifying the same by such
persons as haue not onely seene them, which euery common
Curseters and prating cousener, can also do: but also such as
haue had the skill to obserue euery action, and an intent
truly to report it againe. Homer called Vlysses a wise
man, (which is the goodliest title that can bee giuen to a
Prince, or to a Captaine) not because he had heard, but because
hee noted and obserued the manners and customes
of sundrie peoples, and sawe many Cities. And peraduenture
it was the reason which moued Plato to make a law, that
none of his Citizens should trauaile abroad before hee was
xl. yeares olde, to the end that being growen wise by age, he
might with more iudgemēt obserue the affairs of the world,
and then report them to his Countrey for the common benefite
thereof. True it is that those Princes, which doe not
willingly admit any trafficke with straungers, contrary to
the law and course of all Nations, as for example the Moscouite,
and Presbyter Iohn, but especially and aboue al other
the Princes of China, who being strengthned by fortifications,
and keeping continuall watch and ward for that purpose,
will not suffer their subiects to passe or trauell into forraine
Countries, because they hold Platoes opinion to bee
true, which he setteth downe in his common wealth, that
strange fashions and customes may corrupt home-borne natures:
such princes (I say) haue no neede in deed, to be any
diligent inquisitors or searchers of other mens actions. But
for other states, that with all humane intertainment and
entercourse do admit all forreiners, and cōuerse kindly with





them, and embrace their enterests and confederacies, and
therfore are more strongly & entirely enforced of necessitie
to guard themselues from their neighbors that are of great
power & might, to the end they may the better maintaine
their owne seigniuries and dominions: for such states (I
say) it is great reason & verie conuenient, that they should
throughly informe themselues, & endeuour to their vttermost,
not only ingeneralitie, but also in euery particularitie
to vnderstand all matters whatsoeuer which may be referred
not vnto priuate Interestes and commodities, such as,
matters of trafficke, and marchandizes be, but to the state
of the whole common wealth, which are properly belonging
to Princes themselues. For as we do read written Hystories
to the end we may learne how to gouerne and manage matters,
aswell present as to come, by vnderstanding and reading
how things haue fallen out, that haue beene heretofore
recorded in particularitie: so ought we also to knowe
how the affaires of the world do presently stand, to the ende
we may prouide remedies in time, and meete with all inconueniences
according to the generall knowledge which
we haue learned by our reading: for such is the course and
order of our knowledge, that by singularities we proceede to
the notice of vniuersalities. And therefore the Venetian
Magnificoes, who are not meanely exercised and experienced
in matters of state, do not onely send vnto other princes
such Embassadors as are of quicke wit and conceit, according
to the custome of other principalities, but also haue
established for a lawe, that at their returne they shall in the
Senate make a true and particular report of the Prince and
state, with whom they haue beene Ledgers during the time
of their Embassage: and so by that meanes they shall instruct
the yonger sort, which are trained vp in the studie of





politike affaires, to be the better enabled for the seruice of
their Countrey. And to the same purpose, that their Common-wealth
may be also better gouerned, as well by the example
of such matters as haue alreadie passed, as also by the
fresh information of things presently in action, they preserue
and keepe the said writings with great faithfulnesse
and secrecie in a Register especially appoynted therevnto.
And this was the cause, that I perceyuing how the actions of
the Turkes, were publikely either too much extenuated and
diminished, or else beyond all truth magnified, and enlarged
rather vpon want of true instruction and information, then
vpon any sting of passionate affections, which oftentimes
make report of many matters to diuerse priuate persons verie
indiscreetly, and inconsiderately, began to bethinke my
selfe, that it could not choose but proue verie profitable to
the state of Christendome, if I would take vpon me the care
to examine the present estate of the Turkish Empire, and
endeuour to discouer the disignements which that Prince
hath plotted against the Christians, in the best manner I
could. And forasmuch as it is not alwayes good, to giue too
much credite to auncient Records, though they be neuer so
true, because Principalities and states are easily altered and
chaunged, either vpon the nature or disposition of the new
succeeding Prince, or vpon condition and circumstance of
time, or vpon some other accident: (yea and so much the rather,
for that the Venetian records which were woont to be
most faithfull and sincere, are not now imparted or communicated
to any man by a speciall prohibition which they
haue made amongst themselues, the auncient reportes also
beeing now to no purpose, and the briefe that is ordinarily
deliuered abroad, being rather imagined and full of errors
then containing matter of truth) I haue resolued with my





selfe, to be more diligently enformed, as farre as possibly I
could, of all those particulars which I thought meet and necessarie
to bee knowne in these times, because I am verily
perswaded, that the present warre now in hand, is a matter
of the greatest consequence that is at this time currant in
the world. All which I haue done vpon speciall and priuate
conference that I haue had with persons of great experience
and iudgement, who are lately come out of those parts,
not trusting mine owne selfe in such matters, which I haue
heretofore seene, and oftentimes verie deeply considered of.
And so at last I haue reduced the whole into a briefe or compendious
Method, for the benefit and seruice of Christian
princes, & specially of those, who in regard of their interests
with the Turke, haue greatest neede of such information.
For seeing I was not able, by reason of mine infirmitie, to
follow the warres, as I ought to haue done, after the example
of Benedict Soranzo my father, who died at the conquest
of Gorzolari in fighting against the Turkes, yet had
I a desire at the least to doe some seruice to the common-wealth,
which alloweth it to be a matter lawfull for euerie
man to labour and write, as Polyaenus of Macedonie
writte to the Emperours Antoninus and Verus, rather
then by choosing to liue idle and free to my selfe, I shoulde
seeme altogither vnprofitable and vnfruitfull to all others.
So did Diogenes, when the rest of the valiant and couragious
Citizens were verie busie in defending the walles
of their Countrey, he went vp and downe in the Market
place, rolling his Tunne to and fro, because he alone would
not be idle (as he said) whiles other were valiantly labouring
with their weapons.
         And therefore in this discourse or report, I will entreate
of the Ottoman Empire and specially vnder Mahamet the





third, vntill the yeare 1597. The time I do of purpose set
downe, because I know verie well, that the euent and successe
of warre may alter many things, according to the mutabilitie
of the Prince, or necessitie of sundrie occasions,
which euen to this houre haue altered and changed sundry
matters. And this will I doe principally and chiefly regarding
that which apperteyneth to the knowledge of this present
warre, which the Turke now wageth agaynst the Emperour,
and the Transiluanian, or any other matter, which
by occasion of the same warre may fall out to be considerable.
For if I would haue vndertaken a longer course, I
should haue too much enlarged this volume, peraduenture
to the griefe and tedious conceits of other men. Besides
that a great part of the remnant of this hystorie, I haue at
large extended in other my writings, and part thereof I
may perhappes performe in other occasions. Howbeit I will
not forbeare to tell you of many matters, especially of such
as may be at all times profitable and beneficiall to all Christendome:
to the ende, that aswell those which liue at this
day, as also those which shall succeede vs in posteritie may
in some sort reape some benefite and pleasure of this labours,
wherein that I may proceed methodically, and orderly,
I will distinguish and diuide this present relation into
three parts.
         In the first it shall be entreated of the Head, of the
Members, and of the forces of the Ottoman Empyre.
         In the second, of the Cogitations and Designements of
the Turkish Prince: of the causes of this present warre, together
with the beginning and proceedings thereof: wherein
for the better vnderstanding of euery thing, the original
of the said warre shall be fetched and repeated, euen from
Amurath, father to this liuing Mahamet.
         



            
In the third and last, it shall be discoursed, that suppose
the Grand Turke will be reconciled, whether it be good for
the Emperour, and the Transiluanian, to entertaine peace
wiih him. Wherein also many matters shall be discouered,
which (if the warre shall continue) may be plotted agaynst
him by the said Princes, and which at all times may bee
practised by other Christian Princes, to meete with such
perils and dangers as are now imminent, or any other
which may hereafter light vpon Christendome
by the Ottoman
forces.
      
      
         
         An aduertisement to
the reader.
         COurteous Reader, if in all this discourse
you do not reade, that Mahamet Satarzgi,
(of whom mention is made pag. 9.)
is now become the General of the Turkish
campe. That Sinan Cicala (pa. 6. b.)
beginneth to recouer the fauor of the Emperor Mahamet.
That Hassan Bassa, who had the gouernment
of Constantinople in the absence of the great Turk
(pag. 6.) was first created chiefe Visier, and afterwardes
put to death: And lastly, that the
Prince of Transiluania hath surprised Feulac, and
Canaal, and such other like matters. And especially,
that the Christian Emperour hath recouered the
strong Fort of Giauarino, chiefly through the grace
and fauour of God, and next by the notable valour
and labor of Adolph Baron of Schwartzenberg, most
worthy of eternall memorie: I pray you remember
how the Authour in his former Preface doth protest,
that touching certaine accidents he writeth no
further then till the yeare 1597. wherein hee also
dealeth like a Politician rather then like an Historiographer:
& therefore referreth those matters to some
other workes which he had then in hand. Farewell.

         THE FIRST
PART,
         Wherein is treated of the head, of
the Members, and of the Forces
of the Ottoman
EMPIRE.
         IN the Ottoman Empire,Mahamet, a name dreadful to Christians, and fatall to the Turkes. there
new raigneth, Mahamet the
third of that name: a name verily
no lesse dreadfull and terrible
vnto Christendome, if ye obserue
and marke the actions of the other
two former Mahamets, then
fatall to the Turkes themselues, euen in their owne
opinion: for they doe greatly feare, that as the Citie
of Constantinople, had her second beginning and increase
from one Constantine, and afterwards was lost
and destroied vnder another Constantine, both being
the sonnes of two Helenes: and likewise the Empire
of Rome, began in one Augustus, and ended in another
Augustus; so this Citie shall be lost againe vnder





a Mahamet, euen as it was with armes conquered by
Mahamet the second.
         
            §. I.
            THe now liuing Mahamet, Emperour of the
Turkes,The nature & conditions of Mahamet. is by nature wittie, and by disposition
fierce and cruell: but by accident myld, timorous,
and greatly effeminated, as hereafter shall bee
shewed plainely, by certaine examples of diuers
matters that haue beene done by him, both before
he came to the Empire, and also after.
            Mahamet,Why he hated Nasuf-Aga, the Dwarfe. while he was but young, being shut vp
into the Serraglio, and bearing great hatred against
the Dwarfe Nasuf-Agà, for the many fauours which
he continually receiued at the hands of the Emperour
Amurath, endeauoured so diligently to pry into
his actions, as hauing obserued, that euerie day
he sent out of the Serraglio, a basket of flowers, hee
imagined with himselfe, that vnder those flowers,
hee conueied forth some things of greater moment.
And thereupon, one morning hauing staied the Carier
by force, and powred the flowers out vpon the
ground, he found the basket full of Gold, and with
exceeding indignation, accused him to his Father,
telling him, that he was lesse fauored then his slaues:
For (quoth he) they abound in that which is denied vnto
me. And this he spake, because hee found his Father
to be verie couetous.
            Moreouer,Who were his grand-mother, and Mother. hee was so haughtie and disdaine full,
as he could not endure that his grand-mother, who
was (if all be true) a Gentlewoman of Venice, and of





the house of Baffo, should domineere in the Court,
and ouer his Mother, who was born at Rezi,The suspition that Amurath had of him. a towne
in the mountaines of the Ducagini in Albania. In so
much, as quarrelling with his Father for the same
verie oftentimes, and ministring dayly vnto him
new oecasions of dislike and feare: (for the Ottoman
Emperours are so iealous of their owne life and safetie,
as both in regard of the common ambition of aspiring
minds, as also, and much the rather of their
owne particular and peculiar crueltie, they will not
pardon nor spare their owne bloud.) After hee was
circumcised according to the Lawe of Mahamet,
(wherat were present the Embassadours of the Emperour,
of the Moscouite, of the Persian Sophi, and for
the State of Venice, Giacomo Soranzo my vnkle, who
in that businesse, had the chiefe place aboue the
Christian Princes.) presently he was sent by his Father
into Magnesia, there to abide and keepe his residence.
But when he did there euerie day more and
more discouer his fiercenesse and crueltie;Examples of Mahamets crueltie. by causing
(sometimes in deed of an indignation and rage,
but sometimes of a fantasticall humour) the teates
of women to bee pinched off with hote burning
tongues: by putting to a most cruel death, two thousand
Softì, (that is to say, Schollers) onely because
they had made a signe vnto him of some vnchast cogitation:
and by killing many other persons, vpon
verie light and slender occasions: and finally when
he shewed himselfe to be vtterly alienated from venereall
and wanton pleasures, and wholly occupied
in Martiall actions: His Father grew into such a
conceite against him, as adding thereunto sundrie





other weightie suspicions of secrete intelligences,
which vnder the colour of friendship hee entertayned
in the Court with Sinan Bassa, (he that surprised
Giauarino, and died the last yeare:) entred into a cogitation
with himselfe not onely to haue him better
guarded, but also to depriue him of his life, if he did
not change his course. Whereof being oftentimes
aduertised by the Ladie Sultane, his mother, and also
aduised by her to plucke this suspition out of his
fathers head by addicting himselfe to pleasure, hee
was obedient vnto her therein. And afterwardes he
was so farre giuen ouer thereunto, as either altering
or dissembling his proper nature, hee is by this accident,
and of his owne accord growne to bee a most
sensual Prince: and whether it be by habite and custome,
or by enchaunting besotment, as some think,
(wherein the Greeke, Hebrew, and Turkish Ladies
are most cunning and skilfull,) hee cannot now liue,
no not when he is in armes amongst his Souldiers,
without those pleasures, not without communicating
the most important secrets of his state with his
Fauourites and Miniones: Then which there is nothing
more dangerous and pernitious to Princes. Notwithstanding,
I cannot agree in opinion with those
who doe attribute the cause of this late going
forth into the warres in his owne person, to this his
sensualitie: for there are diuerse other truer reasons,
that may be alleadged of that his lingering.
         
         
            § II.
            FOr Mahamet being now become a new Prince,VVhy Mahamet lingred his going to the warre.
determined to informe himselfe first before all





other things, what were the forces of his state. Hee
did well know the dislikes and braules which were
amongst the Bassaes, and especially betweene Sinan
and Ferat: in whose handes remained at that time
the whole management of his Empire, as in due
place we shall shew hereafter. There was in Constantinople,
a verie great dearth of all things necessary for
vittaile, and specially of bread. He perceiued that the
subiects were much discontented for many debts,
which his father had not payed, but afterwards
he satisfied them himselfe. He was not fullie perswaded,
what stirres the Persian might make, for the
death of the young hostage Haidar, sonne to Emir
Hamze, who was eldest sonne to Mahamet Codabanda:
which was thought to haue happened not
without some suspicion of poysoning. Besides that
his principall Captaines promised, that they would
follow the warres without his presence: (for they
thought, that so they might the more easily enrich
themselues.) He gaue exceeding credite to the important
counsel and aduise of Sinan, who had vowed
the vtter ruine and destruction, not onely of the
Prince of Transiluania, but also of the Emperor without
any great difficultie: (and all this, because by
continuing still in that supreme degree of gouernment
which he then enioyed, hee might make his
persō the greater.) Moreouer, most true it is, that Mahamet
loueth peace: for that fiercenesse and crueltie
which is naturall in him, and yet mollified by pleasure
and ease, as Iron is by fire,Why he killed one of his dearlings. is rather the disposition
of a tyrant, then the hardinesse of a true warriour.
And that was manifestly declared on a time,





when one of his dearest women, with teares & most
affectionate praiers besought him in his gardens,
that he would not go forth to the warres, by reason
of a certaine strange and wonderfull dreame which
she had the night before: but hee, growing into a
great rage, for that shee went about in such sort to
hinder the glorie, or rather, (as he said himselfe) the
safetie of his state,He threatned his mother. with his owne hand slue her: and
did not sticke likewise to threaten his mother, that
he would also kill her, though otherwise shee was
greatly esteemed and dearly beloued of him.
            True also it is, that it was most conuenient for
him to applie himselfe to the necessitie of the time,How the authoritie of the visiers was diminished.
because he was but little esteemed, and not so willingly
obeyed by his subiects, as the most part of the
former Ottoman princes were: by reason that the
authoritie, which in times past was wont to be in the
chief Visier, he suffered to be communicated and diuided
among the other Visiers: so that whensoeuer
any fauour or benefite was graunted to any by one
of them, it was verie often repealed and reuoked by
the rest: A course that of all other doth soonest abate loue,
and ingender contempt. And so much the rather, for
that his father Amurath had taken order that the
Visiers might bee remooued vpon euerie light occasion,
and had also brought vp a new custome to
create many for money, and increased the number
of them from foure to nine. Lastly, hee was enforced
thereunto by the often chaunge and alteration,
which he vsed to make of his Heades and Captaines,
either vpon some wrong information, that
he had of the state, and of their natures, or else because





it is a naturall propertie belonging to the Turks
to chaunge their honours, and also their purposes,
according to the euents of fabulous Fortune. For
hauing receiued diuerse and sundrie discomfitures,
he was of opinion (and indeed he doth alwayes put
it in practise) that with the alteration of the head,
hee shoulde make the members more couragious
and hardie.
            But against all these reasons aboue rehearsed,How he gayned the good will of the Souldiers.
there were other respectes that preuayled indeede
with him, and caused him to goe forth to the warre:
and in particular, because the Souldiours being
poore, newe, and discontented with the auarice of
the former Generals, desired greatly the presence
of their Lord and Emperour: and that principally
for the largesse and giftes, which hee vseth to bestowe
vpon them, when hee is in the campe himselfe.
Where hauing now at the last appeared in
person, hee hath obteyned great reputation, hee
hath cancelled the dishonourable opinion that was
conceyued of him, and he hath yeelded a singular
satisfaction to his subiects: and so much the more,
for that he endeuoured himselfe to gaine the beneuolence
of his Souldiours, by shewing himselfe not
onely verie liberall in bestowing largely vpon them,
but also prouident and circumspect in walking on
foote and visiting their lodgings. For which action
being reprooued by some of his Counsellers,
for that hee exposed and offered himselfe too much
to manifest daunger, contrarie to the custome of
his predecessours, hee aunswered them with the
wordes of Cyrus, That all those which followed him in





seruice being his brethren, it was fit he should make as good
account of them as of himselfe. Another action of
his there was, which did greatly reconcile their
loues vnto him, viz. that being in his iourney, one
Euening hee mounted vp to the top of his Pauilion,
and espied two Tentes of Spahoglni, disunited
from the rest of the Campe, to murther and rob
such as scatteringly went abroade from their lodginges:
whereof being certainly assured, hee gaue
them for a pray to the Gianizzaries, and afterwards
caused their bodies to be fixed vpon stakes in the
Campe.
            Nowe to referre other matters to a more fitte
place:How the Turkes call their Emperor. hitherto it hath beene discoursed of the
nature and conditions of the now liuing Emperour
of the Turks, whom they call Sultan Alem that
is to say, The Lorde of the worlde, or (as others interprete
it) The Emperour of all, and King of Kinges:
and therefore they call him also, Vlu Padi-Schach,
that is to say- The supreme or Soueraigne Emperour:
and to be short you haue here heard of the Chiefe
head of the present Ottoman Empire: For as touching
his Children, although they doe also somewhat
appertaine to the Head of this Empire, yet I
doe not intend at this time to enlarge this discourse
about them.
         
         
            § III.
            ONely thus much I will say,The sonnes of Mahamet. that hee hath two
Sonnes: For his first and eldest dyed not
long agoe. The eldest of those that are aliue at





this day, is of the age of 14. yeares or there abouts,
and hath not as yet beene seene:When they may be seen openly. for the sonnes of
the great Turke may not be visited nor seene abroad
publikely, vntill they be circumcised. And it
is verie likely, that keeping companie (as hee doth)
with many women, (among whome his greatest
Fauorite and chiefe Dearling,Who is Mahamets chiefest Minion. is one La Flatra a
Gentlewoman of Ciprus) he is to leaue behind him
vnto his successor, many other children, for matter
of the vsuall and wonted Tragidies of the Ottomans.
But now I come to the mēbers, and first to the Principals.
         
         
            §. IIII.
            MAny men hold an opinion,Whether the Ottoman Empire want good Captains or no. that this Empire
wanteth verie good Captaines. Whereunto
they are peraduenture induced, because they haue
vnderstood, that there are now dead, Piali, he that
attempted the Isle of Malta: Mustafa, he that supprised
Cyprus, Pertaf, Ali, and Vlucchiali, who were ouerthrowne
in the Sea by the League of the Christian
Princes, in the yeare 1571: afterwards Osman,
Ferat, and Sinan, who performed memorable exploites
in Persia, and else where: and hereupon they
do thinke that together with these, there are wanting
some valourous persons among the Turkes.
A suspition verily, not altogether varying from the
truth. For most certaine it is, that the long and troublesome
warre in Persia hath depriued this Empire
of many warriours, that were of credit and valour:
howbeit the power and mightinesse of this state being
at the first instituted, and sithence encreased by





Armes,How the Turks arise to militarie honours. and hauing maintayned it selfe hitherto
rather by force then by loue, all such as haue any
spirite of glorie among the Turkes, applie themselues
to warrefare, hoping thereby onely to grow
rich, and honourable aboue the rest. For they are
not the most noble among them, but ordinarily
the most valourous (excepting those that serue
in the Serraglio, and in the Chamber of the great
Turke) that are aduaunced to honours, which
necessarily must haue infinite riches waying vpon
them. And thereof it followeth that this Prince
can neuer want Captaines of approued experience
and valour: and so much the more, because euen
euerie priuate Souldiour may mount from one
degree to another, yea, and sometimes also per Saltum,
by Skipp, to the verie chiefe Generalship. But
for as much as it is an ordinarie custome, that in all
Armies the glorie is not giuen to any other, but
to the chiefe Captaines, hereof it commeth, that
because the most famous and best knowen Captaines
were wanting, all (as it were) at one time,
it is commonly reported, that this Empire wanteth
other men, that are worthie of Militarie gouernment.
            But I will put downe the names of the principals,
which gouerne at this present: to the ende, that if
perhappes they should die, or be depriued of their
charges and places, yet in regarde of that, where of
they shall giue mee occasion to speake, the memorie
and mention of them will serue mee to good purpose
in this present discourse.
         
         
            
            § V
            BEfore that Mahamet the Emperour departed
from Constantinople,
                  
                in the most important gouernment
of that Citie, which is full of sundrie Nations,
and humours, and is the seate of that most
huge Empyre, hee set Hassan Bassa, the Eunuch, by
Countrey an Albanian, of a towne of the Cicalessi,
in the territorie of Elbasana. This man was
Bassa of Cairo, in Egypt in the yeare 1582. at what
time beeing recalled to the Court,
                  
                because he was
accused of diuerse misdemeanours, hee was in a
great doubt with himselfe, and almost indeede
resolute, eyther by fight to saue himselfe, or else
to retyre towardes Ormuz, and so to passe into
the Indies, but yet at last to Court hee went: where
beeing imprisoned, and afterwardes raunsomed,
by his Stewarde for fiue hundred Crownes, and
nowe againe by his witte remounted to so high
an honour, he will (in mine opinion) passe a great
way further, if he liue. He is a man verie wise and
gracious: a great enemie to the Iewes, and a friend
to the Christians.
         
         
            § VI.
            THe chiefe Generall in the Campe before the
battaile at Agria,Hibraim and his tois. was Hibraim, borne in the prouince
of Herzecouina, and cosin to the grand-Turke.
Hee is a man of small braine, and most





vnfit for any commaund: but liberall, and pleasant,
or rather fantasticall and ridiculous. He calleth the
Sate of Venice, and the State of Ragugia, his Cousins.
He sayth he will take Milan with an Armada or fleet
of shippes: and surprise the Isle of Malta, by making
a mine vnder the Island: with diuers other such like
fooleries. He sheweth himselfe greatly inclined to
peace, not onely because he is verie timorous, but
because he would please the Ladie Sultane, Mother
to the great Turke, and also his owne wife.
         
         
            §. VII.
            TO Hibraim, there succeeded Sinan Cicala, for
that in the last fight with the Christians, as the
one shewed himselfe verie vnfit for so principall a
gouernment,Sinan Cicala. why he succeeded: Hibraim in the generalship; and chief Visiershippe. so was this man iudged to be very valourous
euen by the Turkish Emperour himselfe,
because he had brought backe the Armie, saued him
his life, and left the issue of the battaile, doubtfull.
Whereupon he thought him worthie not onely of
such a charge, but also of the chiefe Visiership. Yet
at the last he was depriued both from the one office
and from the other, because he went about (somewhat
too boldly) to aduise and counsell the Emperour,Cicala degraded and confined into Bursia.
that he would not giue so much credite to the
Sultane Ladies, and especially to his mother, who,
because they would not loose his companie, sought
by all possible meanes to make him an effeminate
and cowardly person; and in the end hee was banished
into Bursia a Cittie in Asia, sometime the seate
of the Ottoman Princes, where hee remained not





without danger of his life. For the mother (as women
are wont to do, which either loue or hate extreamly)
ceased not daily to entreate her sonne, that he would
cause him to be put to death, because shee could not
endure that a slaue should be so bould, as to goe about
to bring her into disgrace. This did Cicala
feare, and great reason he had so to do, not onely in
regard of the vnstayednesse and inconstancie of the
Prince, and the great affection which he bare to women,
but also because he knewe, that Hibraim being
now returned to Constantinople at the instant suite of
the Sultane Ladies, and especially of his wife, (for
the chiefe Visier, being once displaced, cannot returne
againe vnlesse he recouer his former degree,)
he would continually persecute him, and foster the
quarrels that were lately picked against him, by the
adherents and followers of Ferat, who was an arrant
enemie to Sinan, with whome Cicala had combined
himselfe, euen to his death. Notwithstanding
Cicala being verie rich, of a good wit and great
valour, and especially verie skilfull in Land warfare,
as one that was trayned and brought vp in the wars
of Persia: it is to bee thought that if hee can escape
these first violences of his Lorde, he will with such
dexteritie manage the matter as he will recouer that
which is lost. For so did hee, after his depriuation
from the Generalshippe of the Sea which was taken
from him, not so much in regard of the suspition
conceiued for his brothers going to Constantinople,
as to giue satisfaction to the State of Venice,
whome the Turke himselfe was verie willing to
content. The malice, that Cicala bare to that common





wealth, beganne and was grounded vpon a
discourtesie,Why Cicala is no great frend to the Venetion state. that he tooke against them, whiles hee
was but yong and a Christian, onely forsooth, beecause
the Venetian Galeyes had detained a Galeon
of his fathers. He is by his fathers side a Genowaye,
but his mother was a Turke of Castelnuouo: and himselfe
was borne in Messina. He is verie respectiue of
courtesies, and reuengefull of iniuries offered vnto
him. He hath to his wife a Neece of the daughter
of the late Rustem Bassa, and of a daughter of Sultan
Soliman, shee that not long agoe, with incredible
expences made a verie long conuayance of water in
the desertes of Arabia, for the benefite and ease of
the Pilgrimes,Mecca in Arabia. that go to the Mecca or Macca, as the
Arabians tearme that Cittie, which ioyntly they
call Medina Alnabi, that is to say, the Cittie of the
Prophet, meaning thereby that Impious Seducer Mahomet.
Which Gentlewoman being now mother-in-lawe
to Cicala, is verie famous in these times,One occasion of the present war in Hungarie. for
that she was the chiefest perswader of the last Emperour
Amurath to moue warre against the Christian
Emperour, for the death of her onely deare Son,
who was slaine with Hassan Bassa in the battail at
Cupa.
         
         
            §. VIII.
            THere was Generall or rather Lieutenant for all
Hungarie,Giaffer, why degraded. from Belgrado hetherwardes, in the
yeare last past one Giaffer the Eunuch, by Nation an
Hungarian. He was depriued of that charge for
the same reasons, for which Hibraim was depriued.





He hath warred in Persia vnder Osman, Sinan, and
Ferat, vntill he was made Bassa of Tebrisio,Tauris. now cal-Tauris:
where being besieged by the Persians, hee
shewed great valour, wisedome and liberalitie.
         
         
            § IX.
            HAssan Bassa, borne at Herzecouina, sometime the
Dukedome of Santa Saua,Hassan (Sonne to Mahamet Socoleuich,) Beglerbey of Grecia. is now the Beglerbey
of Grecia, as we call it, but of Rumelia as the
Turkes tearme it: for the Greekes call that ,
which we call Europe, by which name [Romania] not
onely Asia was called (as we reade in histories) after
the translation of the Romane Empire to Constantinople,
but also Europe, and particularly Grecia. This
Herzecouina is a part of the Prouince of Bossina,
which stretcheth it selfe towardes Ragugia, in the
high way that leadeth to Constantinople.How the Turks cal him that is chiefe next after the great Turke himselfe. The foresaide
Hassan, was sonne to Mahomet Soculeuich, so
called of Socol, a place in the same Prouince of Herzecouina,
and was sometime Visier Azem, that is to
say, the head of the counsell, and chiefe gouernour
of the Ottoman. Empire vnder three Emperours:
which office or charge the Mamalukes in the gouernment
of the Souldan of Cairo do call Diadar or
Deuidar, and the Grecians call it Protosymbolo. Hee is
verie well beloued of his Souldiours for his great
pleasantnes & iollitie.The state of Hassan. Hee leadeth with him continually
many women, and through his great expenses
is halfe banckroupt. Hee hath beene in Persia,
and was also in these warres of Hungarie: and being
the greatest person among the rest of the gouernors





of Prouinces (for dignitie and authoritie, and beecause
his iurisdiction stretcheth into Bulgaria, Seruia,
and Albania) he keepeth a verie great trayne.
First he was employed by the greate Turke at Rasgrad
in Bulgaria, aswell to hinder the Walachians and
Transyluanians from passing ouer the riuer Danowe,
as also if occasion should so require, that hee might
be there readie to passe it ouer himselfe. But now
he hath hand-ouer-head and verie rashly without any
consideration sent him to Vidino,Vidino. sometimes called
Bidene, a Sangiackshippe, not subiect to the Beglerbey
of Temesuar, as some haue written, but to him of
Graecia. If hee liue, he will proue without doubt the
greatest Captaine of that Empire.
         
         
            § X.
            HAfis Hacmat,Hafis Hacmet why degraded. sometimes Bassa of Cairo, and Eunuch
and an Albanian of the towne of Vonari,
not farre from the Cicalessi, was Generall in Croatia
and Bossina: but being accused of default for not
hauing recouered Petrina, hee was degraded: yet
now he is returned into fauour againe, and is in Scopia.
He is a iust man and a wise, and one that for religion,
or rather superstition accepted this charge.
He was at the first a Mahometane Preacher, (for so
signifieth the word Hafis.) He was the first man, that
waged Turkish souldiours on horse-backe, with pay
and prest-money: in which point, no doubt if the
Ottoman Princes would resolue themselues to imitate
our Princes, they might haue (as it were) an innumerable
company of horsemen and footmen.
         
         
            
            §. XI.
            THere were also in the Campe of Persia, Sinan,Sinan.
Bassa of Buda, an Albanian of the Mountains of
the Ducagini, a man esteemed among the Turkes to
be wise and valourous: And Mahomet Satarzgi,Mahamet Satarzgi. an
Albanian also: for the most valiant Captaines of
the Turks are for the most part of that Nation. This
Mahomet was a long time Bassa of Caramania, where
he made himselfe knowne to be a man of great wisdome:
but now soothing (forsooth) the humors of
the Ladie Sultane-Mother his countrey woman,Why fauoured by the Sultane mother. by
shewing himselfe to be desirous of peace, hee hath
not onely obtained the office of Tzader Mechei Bassi,
that is to say, Chiefe Master of the Pauilions, but it is
also thought that through the same fauour hee will
be aduanced to greater dignities. They say,Why called Satarzgi. that
while he was Peich to the great Turke, that is to say,
his Footeman, hee beehaued himselfe so well in a
fray that happened not farre from the olde Serraglio,
where the Regall Palace is, as hauing hardly
hādled his aduersaries with a Butchers knife, he was
thereupon called Satarzgi, or rather because indeed
he was a slaughterer.
         
         
            §. XII.
            THere was also one Haidar Bassa,Haidar Bassa. hee that beeing
Beglerbey was sent by Amurath into Moldauia,
who by his maner of proceeding there was in a certaine
sorte the occasion, why the Polonians resolued





with themselues to pay a yearely Donatiue or
Beneuolence to the Turke, and so to bee agreed
with him. He is now in Persia.
         
         
            .§ XIII.
            THere were likewise in Belgrado,Odauerdi & Velli. Odauerdi and Velli,
Bassaes both, the one of them well tried in the
warres of Croatia and Bosna, the other in the recouerie
of Madauia out of the hands of Srenipetro, who
with a band of Cosacthi had gotten possession thereof,
rather by rash temerity, then by any great wisdō.
            There are also in the Campe many other Sangiacchi
and ordinarie Bassaes, whose names, because
they are men of no great fame, are not yet come to
our knowledge.
         
         
            §. XIIII.
            MOreouer, it is reported,Hassan: why he stirred vp the reliques of Mudahar to an insurrectiō. that there is recalled
from Gemen or Gimin in Arabia Felice, one Hassan
an Arabian, a Foster-childe and kinsman to olde
Sinan. This Hassan hauing cunningly procured the
reliques of the kindred of Mudahar, to rise vp in a
commotion, who had also before rebelled against
Osman, he obtayned ouer them a very honourable
victorie. And because he is verie rich, he will haue
also some good meanes to maintaine himselfe, euen
with the satisfaction of the souldiours.
         
         
            
            §. XV.
            HAlil Bassa, Generall of the Sea,Halil Bassa general of the sea & his simplicitie. second Cousin
to the now liuing Grand-Turke, is of Bosna or
else of Hungaria, a Fresh-man, and such a one, as hauing
hetherto had no more skill but to collect and
take vp the donatiues and beneuolences of the Maritine
Capes of the Arcipelago and of Morea, and this
last yeare to set on fire the Monasterie of the Calogieri
in Striuali, called in times past Strophade, because
they had entertained the Spanish Armada: is held in
no great estimation. And therefore it is supposed,
that he shall be discharged of that office,Giaffer. & perhaps
there shall be substituted in his place one Giaffer a
Calabrian, brought vp by Vlucchiali: who although
he fled at the ouerthrow in the yeare 1571. yet is he
esteemed to be a man, that will proue well in Maritimall
warfare.
         
         
            §. XVI.
            OVt of all questiō,Captains at sea that Empire wanteth men that
are excellent in the profession of Sea-matters,
for so much as the Turke hath not since the yeare
1572. hetherto made any Armada or Fleet of any acaccount:
and when occasion of imployment faileth,
no meruell though men of worth and valour be not
known, nay though they do wholy want indeede.
And yet when soeuer he shall be peraduenture enforced
to set forth a good bodie of an Armada, hee
may take that course which his Predecessors haue
done, that is to say, he may vse the seruice of the valiantest
Pyrats, that he entertaineth in Tunise, in Bona,Famous Pirats
in Busca, and elsewhere. Among whome the most famous
that liue at this day are Cara Deli, Amurath Bei,





Mahamet Bei, the three Memi, (whereof two are Albanians
and the third is of Corsica.) Sala Bei & others.
There is a certaine French politike author which
writeth, that Ariadino Barbarossa, the famous Pirate,
was allured by Soliman into his seruice, with verie
honourable rewards,Why Soliman vsed the seruice of Ariadino. euen with the chiefe Generalship
of the Sea, aswel to adde strength to his Empire
with the great riches of Ariadino, as also to the end
that Ariadino should thereby bee weakened in such
sort, as he should not be any more able to annoy the
Ottoman State.
            And now after this discourse of the Captaines, I will
speake of the common souldiours, and such members as are
not so principall.
         
         
            § XVII.
            THe great Turke hath two sorts of souldiours:
that is to say,Two sortes of souldiours of his owne and Auxiliarie. souldiours of his owne, & souldiours
Auxiliarie. 1. such as come to aide and assist
him. The souldiours, that are his owne, be either
horsemen or footmen.Souldiours of his owne. I will therefore first treate of
the former, because the verie sinews of that Empire
consist wholly in the horsemen: and afterwardes I
will speake of the rest.
            The best horsemen,The Spahi. that the Ottoman Empire hath,
are the Spahi, who liue vpon their Timari. For the
great Turke giueth two kinds of wages to his souldiours:
one is called Timaro, and the other Vlefe.VVhat wages the Timari are The
Timaro is properly a certaine pension or an assignement
of rents, which for the most part are leuied
out of the lands that are gotten in war, and are proportionately
distributed amōg the souldiors that are
of good desert, & do answer in some sort to the ancient
Colonies and to Fees, or rather to Commendams.





The reward, which the Romanes bestowed vppon
their valiantest souldiours to enioy during life, was
called Beneficium, and those Beneficiarii, that were so
prouided for: the Greekes call it Timarion, and those
that enioy the same Timarati, and Timarioti, deriuing
the tearme from the Greeke worde , which
signifieth Honour. Wherevpon we do read of Theodorus,
(not the Tiro, but the Stratelates, that is to say,
the Pretor or conductor of the souldiours,) that Licinius
Augustus the Emperour, gaue vnto him a Castle
in Heraclea for a Timaro, long before he was wickedly
martyred by his owne band of souldiours, as
it is written in Phile the Greeke Poet, Damascene, and
Nicephorus Calixtus, and as it is read in the Menaco,
that is to say, in the Monthly Register of the Greeks.
The said word Timaro may also be deriued,Niceph. Call. Eccles. Histor. Lib. 7. Cap. 44 and peraduenture
more truly from the Turkish it selfe,
whereby is signified a certaine kinde of procuration
or prouision for some charge or gouernment, which
the Timarioti are bound to haue ouer the lands that
are graunted vnto them.
            The Vlefe is a payment,What wages the Vlefe are. which is daily disbursed by
the Treasurers to the Souldiours that serue for pay,
and to those of the Turkes Court, who are therefore
called Vlofezgi, or rather Olophagi, that is to say, prouided
as it were only for their diet, deriuing that term
from the Greeke worde ,
            The Timari, which the Turke hath in Europe, may
bee some sixteene thousande? Euerie Spahi, that
hath from three to fiue thousand Aspres, of yearely
rent, is bound to go to the war with one horse: from
fiue to ten thousand, with two horses, and so by





proportion to a certaine determinate quantitie:
and some there bee that will carrie moe or fewer,
according to their abilitie, and the desire which
the haue of honour. The greatest part of these
Spahi are subiect to the Beglerbey, and may contayne
some nine thousande Timari: the rest are
vnder the Bassaes of Bassina, of Buda, and of Temesuar.
         
         
            § XVIII.
            BEsides these Spahi,The Spahoglani. there are also the Spahoglani,
who beeing such as commonly come out of the
Serraglio, are some what more daintie and delicate,
and are neatly apparraled like Courtiers after the
Persian manner. They ride (like the Asians) vpon
little Saddles, so that they may easily bee vnhorsed.
In times past they were not bounde to go to the
warres without their Emperour: but at last many
of them were (as it were) enforced to goe forth by
Sinan and Giaffer, for verie want of good Souldiours:
who afterwarde wintered in Seruia, and Belgaria,
did so destroy and consume the Countryes
and the Peasants thereof, as they did more harme to
the Turkes themselues, then if they had beene the
verie Tartarians, whose apparell also they counterfeyted,
to the ende they might easily and handsomly
couer theit misdemeanours.
            Among the Spahoglani, are accounted those also
which are of the great Turkes Court: who are distinguished
into foure orders, viz. the Selectari, Vlefezgi,
Guraba, and Spahoglani. But because the number





of the Spahoglani is the greatest of al the rest, they
are all generally and indifferently called Spahoglani.
            The Selectari and the Spahoglani,The selectari. are diuided into
troupes▪ vz. the Selectari of the right side, and the
Selectari of the left side: and so the Spahoglani of the
right, and Spahoglani of the left: and different badges
they haue one from the other. These foure troupes
of Spahoglani and Selectari, with the two troupes of
the Guraba and Vlefezgi, make vp sixe in all.The Guruba. The Vlefezgi. Guruba
is in the Turkish speech the Plurall number of Carib
and signifieth Poore and naked soules. And Vlefezgi
is as much to say, as Hyred, or waged, as we haue
tolde you before.
            Euerie one of these orders hath his Aga, which
commaundeth two or three thousand horse.
         
         
            § XIX.
            THe Acanzii,The Acanzii, The Heducchi. are for the most part Countrey
Clownes, and are not like the Hayducches of
the Hungarians, as some haue written: for the Acanzii
serue on Horsebacke, and the Hayducches on
foote. And peraduenture Giouius, and other writers
of our time do not well to call them Venturieri, or
Voluntaries: for in cōsideration of some exemptions,
and priuiledges which are graunted vnto them, they
are bound to goe to warre. True it is, that somtimes
they will stray abroad, and robbe the Countrey, as
the Zingari and Tartars vse to doe. They are men
of small woorth. They dwell for the most part in
Dobruccia, a Prouince of Bulgaria, towards the Riuer
Danow.
            



               
The Gionli are Venturiers,The Gionli. or Voluntaries, in deed,
who togither with sundrie others,The Baratli. whom the Turks
call Baratli, that is to say, such as liue in expectancie,
doe goe to warre euen of their owne meere good
will.The Muteferaga. Among these, as also among the Muteferagà,
(which are of the principall Courtiers of the Court,
not bound to go to the warre, but only with the Sultan
himselfe,) there are many Christians that serue
voluntarie. They haue speciall exemptions and priuiledges.
They go wandring abroad euerie where
with great libertie, alwayes preuenting the armie,
like Out-runners: but they giue the fift part of their
bootie to their Lord. The other Baratli are comprehended
in the families of the Bassaes, and Sangiacches,
and in the number of the seruants to the Spahi.
         
         
            §▪ XX.
            THe Timari of Asia,The Timari of Asia. may bee about some fiftie
thousand: and so by consequent about a hundred
and fiftie thousand horse and foote, and seruants:
that is to say▪ two thirds more then the Timari
of Europe. But they are vnarmed, of small valour,
and not apt for warre, excepting onely some
few of them that keepe vpon the Sea coastes, and
serue in the Galleis.
         
         
            § XXI.
            THe Beglerbeyes of Asia,The Beglerbeyes of Asia. of Africa, of Europe. before the last warres of
Persia, were thirtie: but since there are some
moe added vnto them. In Affrica there are three: the





kingdomes of Fesse and Marocco are rather tributaries
to the Turke: And in Europe there are sixe.
            But because I haue made often mention of this
worde Beglerbey, I thinke it will not be amisse to tell
you what it signifieth.
            The Turkish word Beglerbey, signifieth a Captaine
of Captaines,What Beglerbey signifieth. or Prince of Princes: for the Beglerbeyes
are the Supreme Lordes ouer all that haue
any militarie commaund in the Prouinces which
are subiect vnto them: and are the verie same, that
the Melicul Vmerca be with the Arabians, and ,
with the Greekes. Three Beglerbeyes there
be, that are in authoritie aboue the rest, and sit in equall
place with the Bassaes, whome the Turkcs call
Visiers, when they sit together in the open Diuano,The Diuan▪
that is to say, in the Counsell or Court of audience
in the presence of the Great Turke: some doe verie
ill and corruptly call it Douana and Tiphano.
            The first of them is the Rumeli Beglerbeg,The Rumeli Beglerbey. that is
to say, the Beglerbey of Romania, or of graecia, or (as I
tould you before) of Europe. He resideth in Sophia,
which peraduenture may bee the auncient Tibisca:
but it is not (as some write) the Metropoliticall Cittie
of Bolgaria or Volgaria, so called of the people that
came thither from the riuer Volga: nor yet is it Nicopolis,
which is so famous for the victorie which Traiane
the Emperour had ouer Decebalus King of the
Dacians. Neither is it true that Sophia is the same
that Scopia is, which is a Citie either of Dardania or
of Macedonia, as other some haue written: nor was
it Sardica, which is famous for the Synode there kept
vnder the the Empire of the Sonnes of Constantine:





For at this day that is not called Sophia, but Triaditza.
            The Anatoli Beglerbeg is the second,The Anatoli. Beglerbey. that is to say,
the Beglerbey of Notalia, otherwise called Asia the
lesse. He resideth in Cutheia, in former times called
Cotyaio, a Citie of Phrygia. Some call it by another
name,The Denizi Beglerbey. and seate it (peraduenture amisse) in Galatia.
            The Denizi Beglerbeg is he that is the Beglerbey of
the Sea, otherwise called, the Captaine Bassa. Hee
resideth for the most part in Constantinople, which the
Turkes by a corrupt word call Stamboli: and hath
the chiefe charge of the Arsenall, or Store-house for
shipping. Before that Soliman made him a Beglerbey,
he was called the Sangiacch of Gallipoli. He hath
for his maintenance, the Reuenues of the office of
the Subassi of Galata, that is to say, the Treasourer of
Pera, which office is let to ferme, for the yearly rent
of about some sixteene thousand crownes: he hath
also the reuenues of the nine Islands that lie in the
Arcipelago, the chiefe whereof is Nixia.
            And now, seeing we haue tould you of the horsemen, let
vs tell you likewise of the souldiours that serue on foote.
         
         
            §. XXII.
            THese are for the most parte Giannizzaries,
which are drawne out of the Masse or company
of the Agiamoglani,The Agiamoglani. that is to say, vnexpert
youthes culled out of the tenthes of the Christians.
The rest of the Agiamoglani do serue in Serraglioes to
row in the Caicchies, which is a kind of Boate, and
to dresse their gardens, and to do such other seruices.





The greatest part of them haue not aboue one
Aspro a day.
            The Grecians call Aspro (and not Aspero,The Turkish coynes. as some would
haue it) the verie same money which the Arabians call
Osmannes, and the Turks Asce, so termed for the whitenesse
of it,Aspri. because it is made of siluer. Of Aspres there bee
two sorts, the lesser, and the bigger. The lesser are but of
small goodnesse, and beautie, though they be most in vse, and
common among the people. The bigger are of better siluer:
and with them are payed the wages of the Souldiours, and
the fees of the Courtiers. They are by some writers called
Siderocapsia▪ of Siderocapsa, a Castle in the Prouince of
Thasso, which is neere to the famous mountaine Athos
in Europe, called by the Greekee , Mons Aegaeus,
the Goat-hill, either because it reacheth into the
Aegaean, sea, or because it is full of Goates and Kids: or rather,
, the Holy hill, commonly called by the
Turkes, Seitbag, because there are on it three and twentie
Monasteries of Calogieri, or Monkes, that loue to liue in
the Wildernesse.
            One Aspro is worth 24.Manguri. Manguri: (the Manguro is a
Brasse-Money, and is worth as much as the auncient Numulus.)
Fiue good Aspres in weight make a Dramma,Dramma.
or Drachma, (seuen pence sterling:) twelue Drammaes
make a Taller,Tellero. (or a Doller:) and one Taller and a halfe
make a Venician Cecchino,Cecchino. which is as much as a Turkish
Sultanine being a coine of gold, and the greatest price
that the Turkes haue,Sultanino. and is worth some sixteene Paules of
Rome, or much there about. The Soltanine or Soldano,
(as others tearme it) is truly so called of the Sultanes, that
is to say, of the Ottoman Emperours, euen as the Cecchino
is called a Dukate,Brizantini. of the Dukes of the Venetian estate:





and as the Bizantii, or Bizantini, in the times of the Grecian
Emperours, were so called of Bizantium, now Constantinople:
and were euen as much worth as the Sultanini.
            Some writers there be,The diuerse values of these coynes at seuerall times. that haue set downe diuerse opinions
of this foresaid account, because they haue had a consideration
of their seuerall prises at seuerall times For some
times the Aspro hath beene worth no more but onely eight
Manguri, the Dramma but foure Aspres: Nine Aspres
made a Taller: and so the Cecchino, as also the Sultanino,
were no more but 54. Aspres the peece. But now all
these Moneyes are altered: For the Taller is worth seuentie,
or 80. Aspres: the Cecchino 110. 120. and 125▪ And
this came to passe especially by reason of the heauie impositions
that were imposed in Constantinople, by occasion of
the Persianwar. The auncient mony also that went currant
in the Ottoman Empyre was prohibited, because it was
stamped with sundry Images vpon it, which was forbidden
by the law of Mahamet: but rather in deed, and in verie
truth, because it was good siluer, and so by coyning it againe
somewhat baser, the Treasurie and the Officers did gaine
greatly thereby. But now (forsooth) they are not so superstitious
as they haue beene: for they do holde that money onely
to be good and lawfull, which is of the best allay. This little
I haue thought good to set downe touching their money, to
the end ye might haue a perfite knowledge of the true wages,
which the Ottoman Princes doe giue to their Souldiours.
The rest of this matter, togither with the Aegyptian,
Arabian, Sorian and Persian coines, that run currant thorough
all this Empire, ye may haue (with the licence of the
Venitian superiors) out of a late moderne writer: who if hee
had not shewed himselfe somewhat irreligious, no doubt hee





would haue deserued great commendation for the knowledge
that he hath disclosed in many Turkish matters.
            The Giannizzaries then (as it hath beene sayd) are
the best souldiors on foot,The Giannezzaries. that the Turkish Empire
hath. They serue as the Praetorian souldiours did,
and the Mamulukes, for the sauegard of their Lord,
and as did those valiant youths that alwayes accompanied
the kings of Persia, who were called also Ianitores,
or Porters, as saith the Authour of that booke,
whose title is De mundo, amōg the works of Aristotle.
And thereupon it pleased some peraduenture to
think, that the Giannezzaries were so called of Ianua:
i. a Doore,Not so called of the worde Ianua. alluding to the word Porta▪ that is to say
the Court of the great Turke, because his Court of
Audience is ordinarily kept in the gate of his Palace.
But in truth, they are greatly deceyued therein: for
a Gate in the Turkish language is called Capi, and so
is not Ianua. i. a Dore: and therefore the chiefe Porter
is called by the Turkes Capisi Bassi. The word Giannizzaro
is compounded of two Turkish wordes,The true Etymologie of the Giannizzaries.
Iegni-Zeri, which signifie Noua Militia, a new Souldierie:
New, not because it was newly brought in,
(for it was instituted euen by Osmanne Gasi, otherwise
called Ottoman, and renued, or rather bettered
and enlarged by Amurath the first, vpon the aduice
and counsell of Cara Rustem, who was then helde by
the Turks to be a verie holy man:) But new or fresh
they are called, because the Giannizzaries are the
sonnes of Christians, taken from their fathers whiles
they are but children, by the Officers of the great
Turke, as it were for a tribute, euerie fift or seuen
yeare, and sometimes oftener: beeing of the age





some peraduenture of eight, some of ten, some of
twentie yeares, and some aboue. And afterwardes
they are for the most part destributed among the
Turkes in Natolia, to the end they may be instructed
betimes in the lawes of Mahamet, learne the fashions
and language of that Nation, and accustome themselues
to labour and hardnesse, and then are they
called Agiamoglani, as it hath beene told you before.
When they are growne fit for the warres, then they
are sent to the Court, to be admitted into the order
of the Giannizzaries. Those that are not found fit for
the warres, are sent to the Shippes, and to the Gallies,
that they may be employed in the Arte of Sea-faring.
But they that are of a pregnant wit and good
Spirit, are at the verie first shut vp in one of the
Serraglioes of Andrinople, or of Constantinople, or
of Pera, and so by means they come to be employed
in the seruice of the great Turke about his Chamber,
vnder the rule and subiection of certaine particular
gouernours.
            The Giannizzaries haue for their stipend betwene
fiue and sixe Aspres a day,The Giannizzaries wages. &c. and so haue the Agiamoglani
likewise: but they are distinguished by liueries.
For the Giannizzaries haue two liueries euery yeare,
and the Agimoglani haue but one. The Giannizzaries
doe handle the Arquebuse very well, and are properly
called the Arquebusiers of the great Turkes
guard. They will fight resolutely for honour. Some
of the Giannazzaries remaine in the frontiers, and in
Garisons: some of them also keepe on the sea, and
serue in the Gallies, but the greatest part of them are
resident, where the great Turke is: and hereupon





it commeth that there are so many in Constantinople,
where principally they may sooner become Giannizzaries.
But those that are made Giannizzaries at
Damasco at Cairo & elswhere: perhaps, when they
come to Constantinople; vnlesse they be there confirmed,
may not wear the Coyffe, which is called Zarcula:
the last time that they wēt out to wars with their
Aga (a thing not verie vsual) they rather caused great
disorder, thē did any seruice: partly because they do
not willingly obay their Generall Captaine,Their Captain Generall. (whō
by the Persian word they call Ser-Dar, and by the Arabike
Ser-Asker:) and partly because in our times
their order is indeed imbasterdized, and nothing so
valourous and faithfull, as it hath beene heretofore.
            Aga, is the name of the Giannizzaries Captaine,What Aga is▪ and what Agalari are. and
is the chiefe of all the Agalari, who are principall Horsemen,
that alwaies accompanie the person of the great
Turke, and are so called of the word Aga, which signifieth
a staffe, and is a token of the authoritie which they haue ouer
the Chiliarches, the Tribunes, and the Droncarii
or Troncarii, so tearmed a Tronco, of a Bastone or Tronchion
which they carie in their hand.
            Moreouer the Giannizzaries are verie insolent,The insolence of the Giannizzaries.
not onely towards priuate persons, who greatly respect
them per-force, but also towardes the great
Turke himselfe. For hauing in their hands all the
principall forces of the Ottoman Empire, and being
verie seldome, or verie sclenderly chastised for any
fault and thereupon knowing themselues to be very
mightie and greatly feared, they haue not forborne
many times to threaten, that they would depose
their great Lord and Maister, and set his Son in his





throne: yea and verie oftentimes they haue violently
with most barbarous furie enforced their Emperour
to yeelde vnto them in most vnrighteous causes:
As for example, (to leaue those that are auncient,)
they so dealt with the last Amurath, as they
compelled him to giue them into their handes either
quicke or dead, the chiefe Dephterdaro, and Mahamet
Bassa the Armenian, (a man whome hee loued
beyond all measure,) accusing them, that through
their fault, they were not payed their wages by
them with good monies.
            These Dephterdari or treasourers are three,The Dephterdari. one is the
chiefe, and as it were the President of the chamber, the other
two are as Collegues or Assistants in the Exchecker.
            It hath fallen out also, that they are thus become
the more sedicious and insolent, because the number
of them is greatly encreased and multiplied, and
that through the default of the officers that are sent
to make the choice of the youthes: for they doe not
choose the best and the most able for warfare (as it
was wont to be vsed in times past,) but such as they
may haue for want of better men, shuffeling in oftentimes,
by fauour and bribes, many natural borne
Turkes, and sonnes of the Giannizzaries themselues:
as indeede it came to passe in these last yeares, wherin
they haue had no consideration of any other
thing but onely of the disposition of bodie, and
ripenesse of yeares, to the end they might the sooner
shew themselues in the warres, and so passe for
old and experienced souldiours, though in truth
vtterly voide of any militarie discipline.
         
         
            
            §. XXII.
            SOme Spahi there be also, that serue on foote,Footmen of the Spahi. as
those which are at Negroponte, Misitra, and other
maritimall places, and are emploied for ouerseers,
of the Gallie-Slaues: they are subiect to the
Captaine of the Sea.
            There is likewise an Infanterie or company of
footemen in the Garrisons,Asappi & Besly footmen. which is comprehended
vnder the name of Asappi and of Besli. The Asappi
or Asepi, are not the same, which the Hungarians
call Hussaroni, as one Greek author hath written: for
the Asappi go to warre for wages on foote, but the
Hussaroni on horsebacke.
         
         
            §. XXIII.
            FInally the last Amurath,The Culcardasi. perceiuing that he had
not such a number of souldiours of action and
seruice as that Empire was wont to haue in times
past (for the reasons which I will touch hereafter)
hath brought in a new kind of souldierie, both of
foote and horse, consisting of townesmen and peasaunts
being naturall Turkes: and hath granted vnto
them many priuileges of profite and honour, calling
them Culcardasi, a word that signifieth, brethren
to Slaues, proper onely to the Slaues Rinegate and is
a most honourable tearme among the Turkes.
         
         
            
            §. XXIIII.
            IN Africa the Turkes haue either no horsemen at
all,Souldiours in Africa▪ or else verie few: but some footmen they haue,
which remaine in the Garrisons of Algieri, of Tunisi,
of Tripoli, of Goletta, and of other places on that
coast: where for feare of the Spanyardes, who are
verie well fortified with Garrisons, and strongly
fensed in those parts, because they are afraid of loosing
that which they haue there in possessiō, it is verie
necessarie & behouefull, that they should continually
reside and stay.
            And these are the Souldiours aswell horsemen as footmē,
whom the Great Turke may vse in his warres as souldiours
of his owne. Touching whom I am to aduertise you, somewhat
of mine opinion.
         
         
            §. XXV.
            FIrst,The Authors Aduertisemēts touching the Turkes soulours. that the said souldiours are rather in opinion
and fame, so great a multitude as verie many haue
reported them to be, then in truth they are: for as
much as good souldiours there are but few: meane
souldiours not many, and of such as make a multitude,
namely seruitors, victualers and others that follow
the armie, a mā shold make but small reconing.
            Secondly that the horsemen, in whome principally
consisteth the power of that Empire, are not at this
day so lustie, resolute, and painfull, and to be shorte
nothing at all such as they were wont to be, for that
they haue been greatly wasted and consumed in the





warres of Persia, and particularly in this war of Hungarie,
where barley was so scant, and all other kinde
of victualles, for men, horses, cammels and other
cattell verie deere.
            Thirdly, that the Spahi, who are the best horsemen
that the great Turke hath, haue not had any meanes
to buy good horses, not only by reason of the dearth
of all things, (which I tell you was verie great) but
also because all their good horses are spent and consumed,
neither haue the Spahi any commoditie or
benefit to maintaine them withall, or to buy them
any new, but only that which they defaulke out of
their Timari. Moreouer, they beeing become men
now a dayes greatly giuen to ease and to gaines, do
not sticke to take money to interest, rather to the end
they may buy some Timari withall then buy any
horse-flesh with it, yea and to lend it out at vsurie
to others that afterwardes become banckrouts. And
although peraduenture it may seeme to some, that
in these last yeares, the horses were many: the cause
thereof was this, that the Turkes are now become so
tender and effeminate, (especially since the Delicacies
of the Persians haue wrought euen the very selfe
same effect in thē, which riot and excesse wrought
among the Grecians and the Romanes) that euery man
(for sooth) will carie with him to the wars, so many
easments of bedding, kitchen & victual, that they are
enforced to vse many horses for those purposes: neither
is there any horsemen; (be he neuer so arrant a
clown or peasant) but he carieth more thē one with
him: & yet all of them (God wot) stark nought, very
leane, & altogether vnseruiceable, as we haue tould
you, & as the experience of the battail of Agria hath





manifestly proued.
            But forasmuch, as touching the diminution of the Ottomā
armies, diuers men do diuersly reason, it will not be perhaps
far frō the purpose, or at least not incōuenient, if I tel you also
what I thinke of it.
         
         
            §. XXVI.
            VVIthout all question the Ottoman Empire
doth want of that number of souldiours
which it was wont to haue in their armies.The Authors opinion touching the decreasing of the Ottoman Armies. And the
reasō of it is this: 1. that the Turkish estate being now
greatly enlarged, those Turks, who in times past for
the straitnes of rowme & narrownes of the countrie,
ran all to the wars like the Tartarians, haue now gotten
more ease, greater pleasure, & better countrie thē
they had before, so that they do not verie willingly
resolue with thēselues to leaue their own houses, &
to go to the Campe. 2. Moreouer the countrey by
reason of the largenes thereof is so far distant & as it
were diuided frō the places where they must fight,
that it breedeth great tediousnes in thē to go to the
wars: & to people or to replenish it al with inhabitāts
it is a very hard matter, especially cōsidering that the
Ottomā Princes haue alwaies vsed to extirpate & (as
a man may say) vtterly to root out the ancient inhabitants,
of any new Prouinces, which they haue cōquered
& gotten into their possession: or at least to
transport thē into some other countries. 3. Ye may
also adde hereunto, that the Cōmoditie & encrease
of the countrey hath opened a way to the Turks for
diuers other, and greater traffiques then they had in
times past: wherin the greatest part of thē being employed,
they cannot so easely bee resolued now to
leaue thē & to go to fight, vnlesse they bee enforced





to it against their willes: because by that course
they must seeke to enrich themselues with more incertaintie
and greater hazard of their liues, then by
this of traffike. 4. Besides all this the Turkish
armies consist (for the most part) onely of Rinegate
slaues, and those, Christians: for the Turkes doe not
make any slaues of the Persians or Tartarians, because
they will not part or diuide with them their
Militarie honours and aduauncements, wherein all
the riches, credit and authoritie of their estate doth
wholy consist, and wherewith that Empire doth
counterpoise the perill and daunger, whereunto it
might bee subiect, if they should admit so great a
number of armed Rinegadoes. 5. Those of Asia, who in
times past were wont to execute all Militarie functions,
are now held in small reputation, or none at
all, euen as the naturall Turkes are, and esteemed to
be verie base minded and cowards, no lesse tender
and effeminate, then the auncient Asiatici were
thought to be: and therefore they graunt vnto them
onely the honours of Cadileskieri and Cadi: excepting
some few, that are admitted to be souldiours, and do
serue the Sangiacchi, and the Bassaes, who ordinarily
and for the most part are themselues slaues of Europe,
and sent to be gouernours in diuerse places of Asia.
            The Cadiliskieri (or as the Arabians call them)
Casiaskeri,The Cadileskieri, and the Cadi. that is to say, chiefe Iudges in the Ottoman
Empire, and the ordinary Iudges of causes both Ciuill
and Militarie, are two, the one in Natolia, and the
other in Romania. He of Cairo is not properly called
Cadiliskiero (as some haue written) but the Graund-Cadi,
and was instituted by Selem, after that he had
subdued a great part of the Armenians, the Aegyptians,





the Sorians, and the Arabians.
            And although there be some,Why Greece is not now so well peopled as it hath bin. that do attribute
the want of Turkish Souldiers, to the diminishment
of men, by example of the Arcipelago, and of Greece,
which is for the most part disinhabited, and of all
Macedonia, which is the best part of the Turkes possessions:
it may be answered, that Greece euer since
those times wherein the flower of her greatnes and
Maiestie was extinguished, hath also remained so
barren & void of men, that it was neuer so reinhabited
as it was before. Paulus Aemilius in one onely day
destroyed threescore and ten Cities in Epirus: and
many Ilandes there be, which are vtterly waste, and
not habitable for barrennesse. Besides that, the Ciuill
warres of the Romans, the simplicitie of the Greeke
Emperours, the Armadaes, and fleetes of the Saracens,
and also of the Latines, and last of all of the
Turkes, togither with the notorious iniuries of rouers
and Pirates, haue neuer suffered those Ilandes,
and the rest of that most populous Countrey, so
much as to take breath.
            True also it is,How it commeth to passe that the Turks countrey is so much disinhabited. that a man may walke many a mile
through the Turks Countrey, and find neither men
nor houses. But the reason of this is, for that the Inhabitants
hauing left the townes and walled places,
which are situate either vpon the beaten and common
high wayes, or very neere vnto them are eloyned
afarre of, and haue scattered themselues further
within the countrey, and retired into places among
the Mountaines that are more strong, where they
haue setled themselues in verie populous numbers,
because they would be safe & secure from the murthers,





and robberies of the Souldiers: who are wont
euen among the Turks (I would to God it were not
so also among vs Christians) to liue at their owne discretion,
without all discretion, spoyling and wasting
whatsoeuer they can attaine: for such is their vse
and wickednesse, not the profession of true Souldiers,
as more at large I haue shewed in my booke called
Militia Christiana, Christian Souldierie.
            And these are in mine opinion,Why the Turks armies are so full of poore rascals. the most certaine
and true reasons of the Diminution of the Ottoman
armies: but why they are now so full of people that
are poore, and as it were vtterly spoyled, this reason
may be yeelded, viz. for that onely men of euill disposition,
and such as are the basest persons, and of no
woorth, runne headlong to their warres. And so
much the rather, for that the Spahi themselues doe
send thither in their owne rowmes their seruants &
knaues, who togither with the rest of the Souldiers,
haue no sooner taken a bootie (or peraduenture no
sooner want an occasion to catch a bootie) but they
will flie out of the campe, and returne home againe.
As for example, the souldiers of Sinan did in Walachia
the last year, who hauing nothing left, but their
shirt-sleeues, and being almost vtterly spoyled: because
they would not die for cold and hunger, and
because they found nothing to steale for their relief
in the fieldes, began almost euen at the first to forsake
him: yea and at the returne of the great. Turke
himselfe from Belgrado to Constantinople, all the souldiers
almost would needes follow him, and none of
their Captaines were able to hold them.
            Now that I haue tolde you of the Souldiours, which





the Great Turke hath of his owne, I wil tell you of his
Souldiers Auxiliarie.
         
         
            § XXVII.
            AMong all the Auxiliarie Souldiers,Souldiers Auxiliarie. whose seruice
and helpe hee vseth in his affaires, without
all doubt, the chiefest, the most in number, nay the
onely men are the Tartarians: the knowledge of
whom, because it is not peraduenture so manifest to
euerie man, I will truly and faithfully display, as I
haue done in all thinges before, and will doe also
in those matters which are to bee set downe hereafter:
following that which I haue learned and
vnderstoode from many persons that are verie worthie
of credite, and haue had long practise and traffike
with the Tartarians themselues, and auoyding
especially those fables, which diuerse men haue
written of them. I will adde also thereunto somewhat
of the Circassians, as partly depending vppon
them, and likewise of the Curdians, of the Drusians,
and of the Arabians.
            But because there be diuerse sortes of the Tartarians
or Tartars, so called peraduenture, because they
are the Reliques (as the worde in deede signifieth in the
Syrian tongue) of those Isdraelites, that were transported
beyond Media being then not inhabited: I will treate
but onely of those that serue for our purpose. And
those bee they, which are subiect to a King that
keepeth in Taurica. Whereof some doe dwell
in Europe, and some in Asia, betweene the Poole
Meotis, called at this day Mar Delle Zabacche: the





Riuer Tanais, called by the Tartarians Don: the
riuer Volga, which they call Rha, and Edil, and
the Mengrellians, and Circassians: and all these
are called Nogai. For the other Tartarians, on
this side and beyonde the Volga, betweene Moscouia,
and the Sea of Baccu, that is to say the Caspian
Sea, and the Georgians are partly subiect to
the Moscouite, partly free and of themselues, and
partly vnder the iurisdiction of the Turke, there
where Demir Capi standeth, sometimes called the
Caspian or Iron Gates.
            This foresaide King is called the Tartar of
Crimo.Crimo. Iegnibasca. Nowe Crimo or Kriim (call it as you list) is
the chiefe and principall Cittie of all the Kingdome,
although hee bee resident for the most
part in Iegni Bascca, a place in Chersonesus Taurica,
called at this day by the Polackes and Russians, Perocopska.
The Crimo is beyonde that, neere to
the Ditch,Why the Tartarians are called Precopisi. whereof the Tartarians, especially by
the sayde Polackes, and Russians are called Precopisi,
which is as a man may say Zappahsi innansi, Digged
or delued foorth, so tearmed of the worde
Procop, which signifieth a hollowing or a digging,
and not of a certaine King of theirs, whom some
will needes haue to bee one Procopio. Neither is
it true (as others affirme) that such a Ditch was
made but of late, as it appeareth by Herodotus,
there where hee maketh mention of the Market of
Cremne.
            The tytle of the Tartarian King, is Han, (which
signifieth a Lorde) and not Chan, vnlesse wee will





pronounce C. for H. as the Italian vseth sometimes
to doe in certaine Latine wordes:The title of the Tartar king. Han. Kiocai. Zar. or with
a more harde pronounciation as the Dutch doe
Kiocai, in Beluacens is signifieth Kioc-Han, that is
to say, Gog-Han, a worde familiar and welknowen
in the holie Scriptures. Ezekiel. 38. and 39. Reuel-20.
The Polacckes call him Zar, that is to say,
Caesar.
            The Familie or house of the Tartar King,The surname of the Tartar King. which
giueth him his Surname, is Kirei: whereuppon
they haue beene called Mahomet Kirei Han, Islam
Kirei Han, Hassan Kirei Han. The King nowe
liuing is called Alip: So that by his stile, you may
call him, Alip Kirei Han. i. Alip Kirei the Chan, as
in Fraunce Hugh Capet the king, Henrie Valois the
king, Henrie Burbon the king, &c.
            The coast of Taurica,Which part of Taurica belongeth to the Turke, and which to the Tartar. that is watered with
the Blacke Sea, till yee come to the streyte of Osphorus,
(which is the Cimmerian Bosphorus) at the
entrance of the Poole Maeotis, belongeth to the
Turke: But betweene the Continent, and that
part which is watered with the sayde Poole, belongeth
all to the Tartar, although many Christians
that vse the Greeke rites and ceremonies, doe
dwell there also.
            Of these Tartarians,VVhy the Moscouite feareth the Tartarians. the Moscouite standeth
in greate feare, because with sundrie In-roades
they enter into his Countrey, and carrie away manie
of his Subiectes, to sell them afterwardes to
the Turkes, and others: and in the yeare one thousand
fiue hundred and seuentie: they burnt the very





Cittie of Mosco it selfe: howe much more then
woulde hee feare them, if hee shoulde goe out of
his owne Countrey? In deed the Moscouite may
annoy the Tartarians that dwell in Asia, and keepe
them from dooing any hurt to the Christians vpon
the banke of Volga, where they are to bee
founde as soone as they haue passed ouer the
Riuer. And herevppon it commeth to passe,
that they goe out but in a small number. and that
in this present warre, the report of their multitude
is farre greater then in truth it is.
            These Tartarians that are vnder the Moscouite,Tartarians vnder the Moscouite.
are those of Cassan, Asdrahan, and Citrahan:
of whome, because they serue not
to our purpose, I will not say anie thing at this
time.
            The Tartarians of Europe,Tartarians of Europe. that dwell in Taurica,
and out of Taurica, from the Poole Maeotis,
to the greate Sea, can not bee hindered by the
Moscouites, without the good leaue and pleasure
of the Polaccke. For they must needes passe
through his Countrey, eyther by the way of Smolensko,
or else somewhat lower, by the way of
Tanais, neerer to the Poole. But those wayes are
verie difficult, both in regarde of the Riuers, and
also of the Fennes and Marishes: and besides
that, they are verie long.The Tartarians are Sarmatians. And these are the verie
selfe same Sarmatians, which are of Sarmatia
in Europe and Asia: For the Auncient Writers
doe make Scythia, and Sarmatia, to bee all
one.
            

               
The Weapons of the Tartarians are Scimitarres
and Bowes.The Tartarians weapons. And because they want that quantitie
of Steeles both of wood and Iron, whereof
they haue great neede to make their arrowes
withall, they make them of Reedes, whereof
they haue great aboundaunce. They are verie
keene and sharpe, which they can handle
verie well and nimbly, as well in shooting
them foorth outright, as also backewardes, when
they make as though they woulde retyre and
flie away: which kinde of fight they vse more
like to theeues then souldiers.
            They all ride on Horsebacke: their horses
are small, and vnshodde: when they passe ouer
the Ices, which in those partes are verie great, they
driue a crooked nayle into their horses feete, to
auoyde the daunger to slipping: couragious
they bee, and verie apt to labour, and take
paynes.
         
         
            § XXIX.
            THe Turkes vse the Tartarians in their warres,Why the Turkes vse the seruice of the Tartarians.
both because they are all of one offspring,
(for Mahometanes they bee all:) as also, and
especiallye because they shoulde not vnite themselues
with their enemies agaynst them: for
they are the onelie men whome the Turkes doe
greatliest doubt: and the rather, for that (as



Sultan Soliman saide once in a Counsell which
hee helde in his owne presence,The opinion of Sultan Soliman. touching those
Princes whome the Ottoman Empire ought chiefly
to feare:) the Tartarians may of a soden runne with
infinite numbers euen to Constantinople it selfe, and
arriue there, before that euer the Turkes can be prepared
for defence against them.Why the Turke and Other Princes seeke to keepe friendshippe with the Tartars. And hereupon it
commeth to passe that the Turkes do endeuour by
all kinde of good offices to hold them in friendship,
and to be allied with them in mariage: (for in that
respect Solimans mother was maried to his father,
she being a Tartarian, and the daughter of Mehemet
Kirei:) the Turkes also for the same reason doe
bestowe diuers contributions and beneuolence vpon
the Tartarians, yea, such and so great, as in the
time of warres a Leauie of the Tartarians is verie
costly to the great Turke, because hee must of necessitie
giue them so much, as may bee sufficient
not onely to maintayne themselues, but their wiues
also and children which they leaue at home: so that
to tie them the faster and safer vnto them, besids the
bonds of alliance and kindnesse they are enforced to
vse this necessarie exigent, whereas on the contrary
side, in the time of Soliman the Tartarians were enforced
vnder Sedac Kirsi to gratifie the Turke.
            The Moscouite and the Polack likewise do bestow
great gratuities vpon the said Tartarians, for feare of
their soden in-roades which they may make vpon
them in the time of haruest.
            The Moldauian also, although hee pay tribute to
the Turke, yet is he bound in many respects to grafie
the Tartarians, who are in those parts none otherwise



held to be friends to any, then the Switzers are
to the Princes in our countries
            But because the passages of the Tartarians into
Hungarie in this time of warre,The voyage that the Tartarians may make into Hungarie. are diuers and vncertaine,
and so may also be in times to come, it shall
not bee vnfruitfull and inconuenient, if I touch
the courses and voyages, which they may take, to
the end that we on our side may the more easily endeuour
and prouide either altogether to hinder
them, or at least to make their arriuall there to bee
more difficult vnto them.
         
         
            .§ XXX.
            THe Tartarians,Through the Polack countrey inhabited: when they will ioyne thēselues
with the Turkish armies, must needes of necessitie
passe through the Polack countrey, either inhabited,
or wast and desert.By Russia and Podolia. The countrey inhabited,
is Russia, & Podolia, two Prouinces which are on
their right hand. They may passe also on a soden vnder
Premisla,By Premisla. by the vallies that lead into vpper Hungary.
But both these former waies may be easily stopped
by the Polackes, and the last also by the Imperialistes,
and the Transyluanians. They may likewise
passe at Sumber,By Sambur. or somwhat neerer to Transyluania:
but this is a more difficult way then the rest.
            Through the wast or desert countrey,Through the wast Polack Countrey. they may
passe two wayes, the one farre from the Sea, the other
nigh to the Sea. If they will go that way which
is farre from the Sea, they arriue at the Riuer Niestro
and so enter into Moldauia, and from thence
trauersing Walachia,By Seuerino. they come to Zuerin or Seuerino



(so called by the christians in memorie of Seuerus the
Emperour:) but this may be stopped by the Polacches,
the Moldauians and the Walacchians. At Seuerino,
if they had the countrey friendly and fauourable
vnto them, yet they may peraduenture haue
somwhat to do, before they can passe ouer the Riuer
Danow: but now forasmuch as that place is at the
deuotiō of the Transyluaniā, they shal be enforced to
passe it, & to make way to thēselues by force & arms:
which will proue no lesse difficult vntō them, then
if they should haue attempted the voyage by land.
            The Tartarians also may come to the Niestro,By Achermano. by
the way that is nigh to the Sea: for they may passe to
Achermano, (which the Polacckes call Bialogrod, the
Moldauians Cittat-Alba, and the Hungarians Nestor
Alba,) a territorie and Sangiacche-ship belonging to
the Turkes, at the mouth of the said Riuer Niester,
and not at the mouth of Ister or Danubius, as some
haue written: and it is neere to the Sangiacche-ship
of Bendero,By Bendero. called by the Polackes and Moldauians
Tegina, and is a place in the Prouince of Maldauia,
but subiect to the Turke, through the default of
that Aaron the Vaiuode, who in this present warre,
thinking to reconcile himselfe, for the reuolt which
he made from the Turkes, would not surprise it,
when he might.
            In the said Sangiacke-shippes, the Tartarians
may take two wayes, the one by passing the Riuers
of Pruto and Sereto, and so annoying Walachia: the
other without passing the saide Riuers, and by going
ouer the Danowe in Bulgaria, which is a countrey
belonging to the Turke. This last way, though at



this time it would be the safer, yet for all that it
would not be without great difficultie, yea, and somuch
the rather, for that the Turkes themselues
will not willingly yeeld their consents that the Tartarians
shall take that way, for feare least they should
wast their countrey.Which way the Tartarians went & came to and from this presēt war The first time, that they passed
to this present warre, they tooke the way of Premisla,
and in their returne they went home by Seuerino:
but after that they were discomfited and ouerthrowne
by the Walachians and Transyluanians, to
the end they might more easily saue themselues in
their returne homewardes, they tooke the way last
before named.
         
         
            §. XXXI.
            BEsids the Tartarians aboue mentioned,The Giebeli Tartarians, their weapons & habitation. there are
also certain other Tartarians called Giebeli, which
may be to the number of about two thousand, they
handle the Scimitarre and the Bow: they weare a
Salate and a Iacke, whereupon they haue gotten
the name of Giebeli, that is to say, men of armes. They
dwel commonly in Dobruccia, between the Danowe,
and the Ruines of the wall, that was caused to bee
made by the Greek Emperours, from Gorasui, neere
to Silistria, as far as Constane, vpon the banke of the
Greeke Sea.Why the Turkes vse them. These Tartarians do the Turkes verie
often vse, because they would make the worlde
beleeue that the Tartarians of Crimo, are come to assist
and succour them: and so causing these few Tartarians
to passe ouer on this side of the Danowe: (for
they dwell in the vttermost parte of Moldauia, beetweene



the Niestro and the Danowe,) euen vntil they
come to the great sea in the Sangack-ships of Bendero
and Achermano (whereof I tould you somewhat
but a little before,) they doe mightily encrease the
rumor of them, and breede a great feare in our people.
Lastly,The voyage of the Tartarians of Europe into Persia in old time. I will conclude this discourse touching
the Tartarians, with a conceite worthie of consideration
and memorie, and it this, that as the Tartars
of Europe in the time of the Romanes went euen as
farre as Persia, by the way of Demir-Capi, that is to
say, the iron gates, a place verie famous and renowmed
in regard of Alexander the great, passing
through the countrey of the Georgianes: euen so the
verie selfe same way was taken in our daies, particularly
by Osman Bassa, who therein did greatly labour
to imitate,And of Osman Bassa of late time. or rather to ouergo Domitius Corbulo, and
Pompeius Magnus, as yee may reade in Tacitus and
Dion.
         
         
            §. XXXII.
            THe Circassians, sometimes called the Zighi,The Circassian
are by the Polackes named Pientzcorschii, that
is to say the Inhabitants of fiue mountaynes,
and therefore they are also tearmed Quinque-Montani▪
i. Fiue-Mountayne-men. They doe not reach
to the Caspian Sea, as some haue written, but only to
the Cimmerian Bosphorus, to the Poole Maeotis, and to
the great-Sea.Their maner of life. Some of them are Freemen: but
some of them are tributaries to the afore named
Tartar of Crimo. They liue all after the Superstions
and rites of the Graecians. They goe with the



Turkes to warre, but they serue them euen for
poore pouertie. They vse to sell one another of
themselues: and many of them are become Sclaues,
as well by the way of Mengrellia, and by the Tartarians,
with whome they haue to doe sometimes, as
also by the meanes and conueniencie of Asaf,
which is a Forte belonging to the Turke at the
mouth of the riuer Tanais. They are well accounted
of, for their good disposition and liuely courage.
In the time of the Souldanes all the Mamalukes
almost were Circassians, and thereupon came
the Mamalukes to be called by the Turkes,Osman ouerthrown by the Cassacchi in Circassia. Zercas.
In Circassia was Osman heretofore ouerthrowne by
the Cassacchi: (what they are, it shall be told yee in
due place:) in his returne from Persia to Constantinople,
after he had passed the Riuer Phas or Phasis,
(which is so famous for the Golden Fleece) in Mengrellia,The Godlen Fleece.
which is vpon the great-Sea in the confines
of Trabisonda, a Riuer which Pompey durst not passe
ouer, when he pursued Mithridates, for feare of the
Tartarians, the Circassians, and other people neere
thereaboutes.
            And let thus much suffice to be spoken of the Tartarians
and Circassians.
            The Turke is also wont sometimes to inuite the
Curdians or Gurdians to his warres:The Curdians who are Mahometanes,
and liue like Freemen, and are verie couragious.
They dwell in the region of Bagadat, and
in that part thereof, which now is called Curdistan,
that is to say, Chaldaea, named by the Arabians Keldan.
Some are of opinion, that they may one day
do great hurt to the Turkish Empire. Some thinke



the same also of the Drusians,The Drusians who are souldiours by
profession, and dwell in the Mountayne Libanus: as
also of the Arabian Bandoliers,The Bādoliers of Arabia. who are Lordes and
Maisters of the Champeine, as sometimes our Fuorusciti
or outlawes are wont to be among vs. But
in trueth I do doubt, that the Maiestie and State of
that Empire shall haue small cause to feare either the
first, who do inhabite but a small countrey, or the
second, who are but some few Mountaine people, or
to be briefe the last, who are indeede a confused
number of theeues.
            Now lastly, it will bee verie conuenient, that I
shewe vnto you,Victuall, Armour, & Munition of the Turke. the strength and forces of that
Empire, that is to say, how the great Turke is able
to prouide himselfe and his Armies with victualles,
with Armour, and with Munition, aswell by land
as by Sea. For in vaine were it to haue an Armie,
and not to be able to arme and feede both men and
cattell, or to make an Armada without timber and
people. I will also by the way touch vnto you,
how these prouisions of the Turkes, may bee either
stopped, or verie hardly be brought vnto him: and
by the knowledge thereof it will the more easily appeare,
what the enimie can by all likelihoode doe against
vs.
         
         
            § XXXIIII.
            ANd to beginne with victualles,Corne in Asia. as a thing more
necessarie then any other prouision whatsoeuer,
for the maintainance of an Armie, most certaine
it is, that the Turke wanteth not corne: For



he may haue great store of it out of Asia, and to conuay
it into Hungarie,The wayes to conuay it into Hungarie. he hath many diuers and sundry
wayes. But that which is by the great Sea at
the mouth of the Danow, hath no good free passage,
in regard of the Walacchians, who do now depende
vpon the Transyluanian. That by Constantinople is
to long a iourney, and yet there can none be caried
that way neither. The most free and easiest way of
all the rest for this purpose, is that by Sea to Salonicchi,
and from thence by the way of Scopia to Belgrado,
where the countrey being verie plaine and euen,
the Turkes may verie commodiously make their
conuoyes, and much better they might do, if they
had any cartes.
            In Europe,Corne in Europe. the Turke hath not now any great cōmoditie
of victualles. For Maldauia and Walachia,
although they be Prouinces, that are by nature verie
fruitfull of Barley and Wheate, yet by the occasion
of this present warre, they are beecome almost
altogether vnfruitfull, not onely because they
are not now sowed as heretofore ordinarily they
haue beene, but also beecause that little which
the grounde yeeldeth, is purloyned by men,
and trampled with horses. Beesides that, the
Walachian and the Moldauian, who beeing as
tributaries to the Turke, ought to minister vnto
him all the helpe that possibly they can,
yet at this present they will faile to doe it: the
Walachian, beecause hee is vtterly alienated from
him, and the Moldauian, because hee hath enough
to do to furnish himselfe.
            

               
The Turkes may also conuay some vittailes out
of Macedonia,Corne in Macedonia and Seruia: and how to conueigh it into Hungarie. and Seruia, (two Prouinces that are
woont to bee verie plentifull of corne:) which they
may easily do, because the Country is partly plaine,
and partly hilly, but without any stones. They may
also take the same way of Salonicchi, by passing
through the Champaines of Moraua in Seruia, not
farre from the most fertile plaines of Cossouo, which
our writers do call the Champaines of Black birds,
by reason of the great multitude of them that were
seene there before the battaile, wherein Amurath the
first was slaine. Whereupon I do note by the way,
that the ancient writers were in an errour,An errour of the auncients touching Macedonia and Seruia. whiles
they thought, that a man coulde not possibly
passe through all the Mountaines of Macedonia and
Seruia,: considering that they are verie easie to bee
passed, excepting onely that part of them, which out
of Epirus entreth into Macedonia, for that is in deede
vnpassible with carriages.
            Now touching the point,How the Turk may be hindered from his vittailes by sea. how to hinder the
Turkes vittailes, that they may not be conueighed
and brought into those Countryes, where the wars
now are. I doe thinke that it will proue a verie difficult
and hard matter for vs Christians to bring it to
passe, either by sea or by land. The vittailes of Asia,
which come out of Aegypt, and are embarked at
Alexandria, Damiata, and other places, cannot be impeached
or stayed, without an Armada, or a fleete
of shippes, nor without fighting also with the fleete
of the enemie. Besides that the Arcipelago, where
this must specially and principally bee attempted,
hath many channels.
            

               
And by land,By land. they can be stopped but in one only
case (vnlesse the Turke might bee debarred and
kept out of his owne Countrey, which is the hardest
thing of all.) And this onely way is for the Transiluanian,
togither with the Walachians, to passe ouer to
the hither side of the Danowe, and interpose themselues
betweene Bulgaria, and Seruia, which in times
past were called the two Misiaes. And yet when all
comes to all, there is no remedie but we must looke
to fight, and therefore it will behoue vs to haue a verie
mightie armie in a readinesse.
            Moreouer,What vittaile the Spahi; the Sangiacchi, all villages, and Belgrado do furnish. euerie Spahi, is bound to bring to the
campe, one load of corne for his owne vittaile. All
the Sangiacchi doe send thither, Meale, Barley, and
Graine, when and as much as they can. And all the
villages also are bound to send a certaine quantitie of
Barley, whensoeuer they are commaunded. And in
Belgrado, there is ordinarily made great store and
prouision of Bisket, Meale and Barley.
         
         
            § XXXV.
            IT is verie true,Why the Turks cannot set forth to warre in the beginning of the yeare: nor keepe long in one place. that the Turke cannot set forth his
armie towardes the warres before the grasse bee
growen, or rather not before haruest-time as well in
regarde of the prouisions (as I haue told you) which
the Spahi & others are bound to bring to the camp,
as also because it is necessarie, that both men and
cattell should haue good meanes to maintain them
selues in the field, yea and so much the rather for
that the armie is verie populous, as indeede all the
Turkish Armies are for the most part, of people, of



horses, and of Camels: whereupon it falleth out
also, that that they cannot long bee maintained nor
stay togither by great heapes and multitudes in one
place by reason of their great expences.
            Out of Scopia, they haue some little store of Rice,Rice from Scopia, Alexandria, &c.
whereof the Turkes doe make themselues a peculiar
kinde of pottage: they haue also some quantitie
of it out of Alexandria, and other places, whither our
Marchants do vse to transport it.
         
         
            § XXXVI.
            THey haue great aboundance of flesh-meates, al
their Countrey ouer (specially where their souldiers
meete togither,Great store of flesh meate, mutton and beefe. and goe to warre:) namely of
Muttons, and of Beeffes, which are (as a man may
say) innumerable in those huge and wide Champaines
where they feede and pasture: yea and so
much the more store of them they haue: because
the Moldauian is content that the Turkes shal passe
through their Countrey, with their cattell, their honie,
and their Butter, in regard of the great custome
and toll which they gaine of them for the passages
therof. Although (to speak the truth) there doth not
now passe that way, so great a multitude of Muttōs,
as in time past there hath done, because there was
not heretofore so good a riddance of them into Polonia,
as now there is. Which in deede is no small
griefe and displeasure to the Turkes, who doe vse to
eate the flesh of Muttons with great delight and verie
sauourly, whereas on the other side they do not
so greatly care for the flesh of Beefes.
            

               
The Turkes also vse to carrie with them a certaine
kinde of salt poudred flesh, which being beaten into
powder, serueth them for a verie great nourishment,
especially if they mingle it with their pottage, or
broath: and this meate they call Tzorba.
         
         
            § XXXVII.
            ANd now to their drinke.Their drinke. It is most certaine, that
there want no good waters ouer al the country
where the warres are.Water. And for water, it ought not to
seeme a straunge drinke: for the Turkes considering
that by their law they are bound to drinke it, as the
Carthaginians also do: and as for Religion sake likewise
it is vsed to bee drunke by the inhabitants of
the Kingdome of Tarsus, which on the East confineth
and bordereth vppon Cataio, and is famous
in the holy Scriptures for the three wise kinges,The Country of the 3. kings that came to worship Christ
that came from thence to worship Christ. But what
a great aduauntage it is to the Turkes to haue this
commoditie of water, let them consider that haue
conuersed and practised with the Dutche, (although
at other times also, as Tacitus writeth, they
vsed to drinke at the Well-head.) certaine it is,What meanes Mahomet vsed to make his followers to be souldiers. if we
mark the matter well, that Mahamet their Law-giuer,
did for none other cause so straitely commaund his
followers, that they should so precisely abstaine from
wine, but onely because that hauing throughly resolued
with himselfe to haue his law defended with
force & armes, he thought it conuenient by meanes
of sobrietie to make them as fit and apt for the wars
as possibly he could. And besides that also, he did inthrall



them to the imaginary opinion of the gouernment
of Destinie, to the end hee might make them
the more obedient to their Captaines, and the more
resolute in fight. He also ordained, that they should
often wash themselues, to the ende, that his Armies
might the more easily bee kept cleane and free from
those euils and diseases, which do ordinarilie breede
of filthinesse, and likewise make them the more able
to endure the hardnesse and distemperature of the
weather, with other such like policies.
            The Turkes also haue a certaine kinde of Breuuage
or drinke (which they call Tzerbet,A drinke called Tzerbet. and wee
Srbetto, a Soupe or Broath:) and it is made of
Raisins and water, sometimes mingled with the
iuice of Lemmons, and with Muske: most daintie
and delicate it is, to the taste, and will often strike
vp into the heade like Wine. Whereof also if
any of the Turkes are desirous to drinke,The Turkes especially the Giannizzaries will drinke wine. especially
the Giannizzaries, who will swill of it beyonde all
measure, they may haue some in Hungarie, and
chiefly in vpper-Hungarie, where the wine of Toccai
is verie famous.
         
         
            § XXXVIII.
            LAstly, the Turkes cannot want prouision of
wood and timber,Prouision of tymber. which (as Cyrus sayth) is as necessarie
for an armie, as any other thing whatsoeuer.
True it is, that in some places of Seruia there is no
great store of it: but there is as much as may be desired,
in the rest of the voyage from Constantinople to
Belgrado: and in the way of lower Hungarie, on this



side of the Danow, euen vnto Vesperino: but specially
in Bazca,Basca & Srema plentifull of wood. & also in Srema, which is a Prouince so called
of the Cittie Sirmio, so noble and renowmed,
principally for the Councill that was kept there.
            These two Prouinces doe lie on this side of
the Danow, betweene the Danow it selfe, and the
riuers of Draua and Saua, and haue great abundance
of wood and timber, by reason that they haue not
felt the miseries of the warre, because the Turkish armies
haue not taken that way, but onely in the beginning
vnder the conduct of Sinan.
            And now that we haue discouered whatsoeuer is necessarie
for the vittaile and foode of their men and cattell:Armour of the Turkes. it
followeth also to be considered, how the Turkes are at this
present armed, and how they may haue munition sufficient
for the warre, whether it be Defensiue, or Offensiue.
         
         
            § XXXIX.
            THe Spahi of Europe, to strike a farre off,Armour of the Spahi, Launce. Pusdogan. Scimetarre. doe vse
to weare a light Launce with a pommell, and
to strike at hand, an Iron Club or Mace, which they
call Pusdogan: or else a Scimitarre, or Cimitare: for
so by a barbarous worde they call that weapon,
which by little and little groweth crooked towards
the poynt, and is like for all the worlde to the
Knife, that Xenophon attributeth as proper to the
Persians, called by the Turkes Cedare, by the Arabians
Seife, and by the Dutche Sabell, a corrupt
worde taken from the Hungarians, and Sclauonians,
who call it Sabla. Some of them doe also
weare an Axe, and a short sword. Some few Iacks,



and Targates they haue:Axe. Short sword. Iacke. Targate. Dart. but the rest of all their bodie
is vnarmed. None of them doth handle the Pistoll:
and many of them doe onelie vse the Dart.
The greatest part of those Spahi, that kept in the
frontiers of Croatia, and of Hungarie, had Cuirasses,
and Corslets, but they are almost all extinguished,
& those that are of late gone thither in their roomes
are not accustomed to such armour.
            All the Giannizzaries, and some of the Asappi,Armour of the Giannizzaries and some Asappi, Arcubuse.
handle the Arcubuse, but for the most part not so wel
as it is handled by vs Christians. Which what aduauntage
it may be vnto vs, let those iudge that saw
the handling of the Arcubuse, Da posta: that was so
profitably vsed in the actions of that most glorious
Gentleman Alexander duke of Parma.
            The Acanzii, the Spahoglani,Armour of the Acanzii, Spahoglani, Chiaussi, &c. Armour of the footemen. the Chiaussi, (which
vse ordinarily to go as Messengers or Embassadors)
and other Caualieroes of the great Turkes Court,
do handle the Dart, and some of them the Launce,
after the Asian maner. To be short, all the footemen
almost go with a Scimitarre, and without any Murrion,
but the most part of them with Daggers after
the Greeke fashion.Horsemen of Asia. The horsemen of Asia doe carrie,
as it were, half Pikes. Many of them are Archiers:
they ride vpon low Saddles, so that they may easily
be ouerthrowen to the ground.
         
         
            §▪ XL.
            THere are also in the Turkish armies diuers Officers
or seruants,Armourere▪ Gunners. as the Giebegi, that is say,
Armourers, that surueigh their Armour. The Topigi



or Bombardieri,Armenians. that looke to their Guns: whereof
some haue pay, and some haue none, but diuers fees
and recompences they haue. The Armenians for the
most part do serue for Pioners, and do such workes
among the Turks, as our Spazzacamini or Chimney-sweepers
doe among vs Italians, and thereupon are
in scorne called Bochgi.Voincchi. There go also with the camp
many Voinicchi, who are villaines or slaues. They
liue after the Greeke maner: they serue for any vse,
and dwell in Seruia and Bulgaria. Vonicchi is a Sclauoine
worde, signifying Bellicos, warlike men, because in
times past they were much imployed in the warres.Sarchor. Many
other there be likewise, that voluntarily follow the
Armie to be Pioners, and to doe such other base seruices,
and are called Sarchor.
            And here in this place I will omit at large to entreate of
the Militarie discipline of the Turkes,Militarie discipline of the Turkes. because that point
hath beene better examined by others then I can do. Onely
I will tell you some speciall matters, because I will
not leaue the Reader fasting and vnsatisfyed in this behalfe,
as peraduenture in other poyntes I haue alreadie
glutted him.
         
         
            § XLI.
            VVIthout all doubt,Qualities required in Christian Souldiers. the Turkish souldiers are
farre inferiour to our souldiers that are exercised.
By our Souldiers, I doe vnderstande not
onely the Italians, but also those of Spaine, of France,
of Hungary, of Germany, & of other natiōs that vse to
go to warfare in our armies. And by exercised soldiers,
I mean such as haue not only bin wel instructed



in the arte of warrefare, but also such as haue beene
accustomed with the exercises of a Christian souldier,
to the end that accompanying valour and vertue
both together▪ they may the more surely in the seruice
of our Princes become victorious, although
they be peraduenture farre inferiour in number to
our enimies. Most euident and plaine are the examples
of the victories obtayned by a few Christians
vnder Marcus Aurelius, Constantinus,Victories of the Christians against the Infidels. Theodosius
the elder, Theodosius the yonger, Honorius, Aetius and
many others: but more particularly ouer the Saracenes,
vnder Pelagius the first, King of Castile, who
with one thousand slew twentie thousand of them:
and vnder Charles Martell, who at one onely time
ouerthrewe and vanquished three hundred, threescore
and fifteene thousand of them: I leaue to tell
you what the Christians also did, vnder Alfonsus the
Chast, Ranimiro, Ferdinando, and Waltero the great
Master of the Duch order, who slew a hundred
thousand Tartarians with the death of one onely of
his owne souldiers: and Coruius, who after hee had
obtayned seauen victories against the Turkes, with
fifteene thousand onely,Victories of the Christians against the Turkes. most valourously fought
the eight battail against eightie thousand of them, as
(among others) Thomas Bozius writing against Macchiauel
hath at large described.
            Moreouer, euerie man that hath warred with the
Turkes doth know well enough, that they lodge at
large: and that in their marching they go verie confusedly,
so that they may verie easily be endamaged
in the tayle of their Armie. George Castriota, was
one of the most famous Captaines, that euer fought



with the Turkes,Scander-Beg. and was otherwise called Iskander-Beg,
i. the Lord Alexander, a name that was giuen
him by Sultan Amurath, when being his Hostage or
Pledge he caused him to bee circumcised at seauen
years of age: (for the Turkes at circumcision change
the name, as we vse to doe at baptisme.) This man
fighting thus with the Turks being in this disarray,
had such victories of them as were most worthie of
triumph.
            Besides all this the Turkes, when they do fight,
put more confidence in their Multitude, in the opinion
that they haue of Destinie, in the noyse of
their warrelike instruments, and in the horrible cry
of their barbarous shoutings,Good gouernment among the Turkes. then they haue in any
good order, or in true discipline. And yet many
good things they haue, as namely, a Supreme authoritie
in their Captaine Generall, an obedience in
the souldiers, though now it be somewhat diminished:
forces alwayes readie,A fault in Christian Princes. so that they shall not
neede to go about, begging of souldiers, as our
Princes doe, who verie oftentimes make more account
and better reconing of other mens forces, thē
they do of their own, and to make a leauie of souldiers,
are enforced to euacuate and emptie their treasuries
and to consume the greatest part of their time
vnprofitably. The Turkes spend their treasure
either in matters of greatest importaunce,Good qualities in the Turkes. or in bestowing
liberally vpon their souldiers: which is a
most sharpe spurre to animate and encourage them
to battail. They neuer attempt any enterprise at a
iumpe or vpon a soden. They do not employ their
forces in matters of small moment. They vndertake



no action, but with order and great militarie
preparation: and for the most part they fight not
out of season.
            And although some be of an opinion,Engyners. that the
Turkes want Engyners, yet it is daily seene, that with
great facilitie and ease they ouerthrowe the greatest
fortes and fortresses of the worlde, whereof they
make no account at all: for sometimes they will corrupt
the enimies officers, with honours, with gifts,
and with prouinces, and sometimes they will make
breaches into the walles with continuall batteries,
working with the mattocke, filling vp the trenches,
and other whiles also ouerwhelming Citties, either
with huge artificiall mountaynes of earth, or with
vndermining: and lastly, disquieting the inhabitants
with perpetuall and importunate assaults and neuer
giuing ouer the enterprise till it be performed.
            Moreouer, they do not want any munition,Bullet Artillarie. of
Bullet, Artillarie, Powder. For Bullet, they alwaies
make it when they haue neede of it. For Artillarie,
they haue great quantitie of it, at Constantinople, at
Pera, at Belgrado, and at Buda: the most part of it taken
from the Christians. They haue also learned
to cast Artillarie: the more shame for vs, who haue
not beene contented to transport our arrant cruell
enimies out of Asia into Europe in Amurathes time,
but haue also become Maisters vnto them in this
Arte: and I would to God, that we did not likewise
carrie them great store of Armour and weapons besides:
nothing regarding or fearing the wrath of
God, the excommunication of the Popes, nor the
vtter ruine of our selues. And as for Powder,Powder▪ it is



made at Cairo, and at Acque Bianche. i. the whitewaters,
(which is a place not farre distant from Constantinople:)
and elsewhere in great aboundance.
            The Turkes do also greatly practise militarie stratagemes,Stratagems.
or wilie pollicies in warre, whereby they
do vse to mingle deceite with force, according to
the commandement of Mahomet their law-giuer:
neither do they want meanes and ministers, that
are cunning and skilfull to practise the same, both
because all such, as among them do attend the Arte
of warrefare, do endeuour themselues to learne and
knowe whatsoeuer is necessarre for the good managing
of an exployte, and also because fraud and
deceite is a thing most proper to the Turke. Much
other matter might be set downe touching this
poynt: but if any bee desirous to vnderstand more
hereof, let him read, (among others that haue written
of the Turkish affaires,) the discourses of Renato
Di Lusinge, Lord Alimes, in his booke intituled, Of
the beginning, conseruation, & decaying of States.
            And now that I haue shewed you the Land-Forces of
the Ottoman Empire, it is also verie fit and conuenient,
that I should, likewise shewe you, the forces thereof by
Sea.
         
         
            §. XLII.
            THe great Turke hath many Tersani,Storehouses for shipping in Asia. that is to
say Arsenales or Storehouses for shipping.
The Arsenal or Storehouse of Sinopoli neere to
Trabisonda is one of the best. At Constantinople there
are a hundred & thirtie seauen roomes in one vaulte;



and at Midia and Achilo they haue space enough to
make some if they will. Besides that, the Turkes do
vse also to make Galeyes in such places, where they
may most commodiously haue timber for them: the
charge and care whereof they lay most commonly
vpon the Raislari or Raisi, that is to say, the Captains
of the said Galeyes. Moreouer they haue great aboundance
of timber in many places, & specially in
the golfe of Nicomedia in Asia, ouer against Constantinople:
and in the mountaines of the Ducagini,Europe. from
whence they may conuay it by the Riuer Drino vnto
Alessio a territorie of Albania: in which prouince
also they haue some quantitie at Velona, and at Polona,
which is verie famous by Augustus, who was
there studying, when Caesar was killed.
            The great Turke hath also an Arsenal or storehouse
in Africa at Suez,Africa. in the mouth of the Red Sea, with
certaine Galeyes, which were made heretofore against
the Portingales, for the enterprise of Diu & Ormuz:
but it is of small reconing because in that countrey
there is no store of timber, and to bring it from
the portes of Bithynia and Caramania to Cairo by the
riuer Nilus, and so to Suez vpon Camels is a matter of
great difficultie and expense.
         
         
            §. XLIII.
            IT is most certaine and true that the Turkes do put
their timber to worke,Timber and Gallies. Their Gallies not very good. so ill seasoned, so greene, &
so fallen without any obseruatiō of the course of the
Moone, that their Galleyes cannot proue very good
& durable: and the rather, because they vse to make



them for the most part in great hast: besides that the
houels or vaults, that are made to couer them, are
not so well fitted, nor safe from the raine.
            Pitch hard and soft. Tallow. Hempe not much. Sayles why scant.
            They haue Pitch, both hard and soft from Velonae,
and from Rissano in the golfe of Cathare: the one out
of the mines, the other from the trees. And tallowe
they want not, by reason of the great aboundance
of Beefes and Muttons, that are in those countres.
But they haue not hempe enough, and so by consequence
they are not well prouided of Sayles: and so
much the worse, because the Sultane Ladies (who
haue thirtie Galeons of a thousand & fiue hundred
tunne a peece, and eighteene great Hulkes,The Sultane Ladies Galeons. which
they send into Alexandria with diuers marchandise,)
do draw out of the Arsenal, with the good liking
and pleasure of the Grand-Turke, sayl & chordage,
asmuch as is requisite for the seruice of their
said vessels. Besides that the officers, who haue the
charge of the said Sayls, & such other like furniture
for ships, do keepe them but ill fauouredly and lend
them out easily for gaine.
            The Turks do also want nayls, so that very often in
steed therof, they are fain to vse sharp wooddē pins.Nailes scant.
            
            Of Mariners they haue great store. They entertayne
the Asappi principally to serue them in Sea
actions.Marriners And if they should happen to want any,
they would compell the Candians to serue in their
Galeyes (for there is alwaies a great multitude of thē
in Constantinople) & other Graecians that are their subiects,
which do wholy attend that trade.Gallyslaues. To this purpose
also they keepe many boies exercised that way,
in their watch-Gallyes, in their shippes, and other



Boats. But gally-slaues they want which is a matter
of great consideration: for vnprofitable are their
Gallies, without people to row them. And neither
will the Christian slaues be enough for that seruice,
nor yet those that are supplied out of Barbarie. Besids
that the Turkes do not make any slaues of the Tartarians,
of the Persians, nor of the Georgians, because
they will not admit thē into their militarie gouernment,
which wholly resteth in the handes of their
slaues, as it hath bin somewhat touched heretofore,
and more at large shall be hereafter in the third part
of this treatise. Sometimes they will also command
the Asappi to go and serue for Gally slaues, as a base
kind of people and of no worth: and sometimes others
of the countrey:An Auariz; or exaction raised vpon the Christians for the maintenance of Galley-slaues. for whose stipend and wages
there was applied in times past, an Auariz, that is to
say, an exaction layd vpon the christians of Europe,
which amounted to the summe of three hundred
thousand Cecchinoes or Duckats: but now it is employed
vpon other land-matters. In their great necessities
they vse also some of the Armenians, some of
the Iewes, and some of the Christians, euen by force
& compulsion, as namely Cicala did in the last yeare
of his generalship. The Spahi likewise go for souldidiers
in the Gallyes, that are kept for the defence &
safegard of the Islandes of Barbarie, and other places,
but without any other pay, sauing only the profite
of their Timari: and thereupon they growe wonderfull
greedie to robbe and spoyle. If they make a
fleete of a greater number of Gallyes then ordinary,
(which may be about some thirtie,) they will send
some Giannizzaries into them.
            

               
They make great aboundance of Bisket,Bisket. at Velona
at Lepanto, at Negroponte, at Volo in the gulfe of Salomicchi,
whether the wheate is brought and conuayed,
that is gathered out of Macedonia and Seruia in
Zataraes or Lighters by the Riuer Vardaro, which in
old time was called Auxius.
            And thus much let be sufficient to haue spoken of the
Turkes forces by land and by Sea. But for as much as according
to the opinion of some auncient Captaines, Gold
is the Sinewes of warre,The riches of the Ottoman Empire. and (as it were) the Spirite and
Soule, that quickeneth and giueth life to an Armie: I
will briefly adioyne hereunto some matter touching the
Ottoman riches: Wherein a great parte of the Forces
of that Empire and of other principalities doth consist.
         
         
            §. XLIIII.
            FIrst,His Timari. if wee doe consider the value and account
of the Timari, it is manifest and playne that the
Great Turke, is the richest Prince, that is vpon the
earth: because hauing bounden vnto him by his
Timari, moe then three hundred persons, to serue
him in his warres, without any interest, hinderaunce
or charge of his owne, it may easily bee
perceyued, what a great matter it would bee
for him to maintayne so many Souldiours, with his
owne pay.
            Moreouer,The Turkes Hasnads or Treasurie. the great Turke hath two Hasnads, (or as
many do pronounce it with a stronger aspiratiō, Gasnads)
that is to say treasuries whereof the one is



called the outward or cōmon treasury, the other the
inward or priuate Treasurie.The common or publike Treasurie. The priuate Treasurie. Giftes. The former hath about
some nine or ten millions of yearly reuenue, which
is wholy imployed in the expences that are needfull
and necessarie for the state. The later is exceedingly
rich, by reason of the many and great giftes
or presents, which are giuen to the grand-Turke by
sundrie Princes, and specially by the Christians, by
his owne seruiters and subiects, and by all such as
haue any thing to deale with him, not permitting
any person to come before his presence with emptie
handes, for hee doth attribute that, which indeede
turneth to his chiefest gaine, rather to be a signe of
his great pompe and Maiestie. And truly if yee shall
well consider the nature of the whole generation of
the Turkes, ye shall find all of them to attend none
other thing, but onely to gather that they may giue
it afterwarde to the great Turke: so that by this
meanes, all the riches of that large Empire doe passe
through their handes, as it were through water-pipes,
into the huge Ocean of their Emperours
couetousnesse.
            Into the same priuate Hasnad, or Treasurie,Reuenue of Cairo. there
runneth also the yearely reuenue of Miszir (for so
the Arabians and Turkes doe call the ancient Memphis,
that is to say, Cairo, by a corruption from the
Hebrew worde Mizraim) which reuenue amounteth
to the summe of aboue one Million. There
runneth thither also,In heritances. the yearely value of all the inheritances
of the richest persons in all his Empire,
whose heire he maketh himselfe to bee, euen at his
owne pleasure. For all the wealth of those, which



beare the title of slaues, doth wholy depende vpon
his supreeme will and disposition. Thither come
likewise, all confiscations and forfeytures,Confiscations, fines, &c. all fines
and amercements (which are verie many) all the
goods of such as are condemned by law, all the Reuenue
that is gathered of Custome and Impost: all
the rent of the Salt-pits, and the Tithe and tents of
all prayes that are taken by land or by sea, of all cattell,
and of all Haruests in the fields: the profite also
of the Mines,Mynes. whereof there are verie many in Seruia,
(insomuch as it is called, Prouincia d' Argento, 1.
the Prouince of Siluer) in Bosna about Iaiza, in Macedonia,
and elsewhere. All which ioyntly togither,
amounteth to a most huge quantitie of golde more
or lesse, according to the greedie auarice of the
Prince, and to the diligence, or rather insaciablenes
and extortion of his officers.
            Besides all this,Tribute of the Christians. the Turke doth also leuie a tribute
vpon the Christians, which is a Sultanine vpon euerie
Head, or Poll of them, assoone as they are aboue
xiiii. yeares olde: which tribute is now encreased to
a higher rate,Tribute of the Turks themselues. by occasion of this present warre.
There is likewise a certaine redemption of that,
which is payed by the Turkes according to the rate
of fiue and twentie Aspres a peece, and is called a
Gift, because it is expressely forbidden by their law
that the Turkes shoulde take any tribute of the
Turkes.
            Lastly,Treasure left. the now liuing great Turke, did finde in
this priuate Hasnad or treasurie, great store of gold,
but not in that excessiue quantitie, as some haue bin
bolde to write, which was gathered togither by his



father, who was very auaricious and greedie beyond
all measure, and as insatiable and carefull to hoorde
vp, as he was miserable and sparing in spending and
giuing.The couetousnesse of Amurath the third. He was of the minde that he would sell euen
the flowers of his owne Gardeines: hee payed no
debts: he gaue nothing, or at least verie little to his
souldiers: a thing that was farre different from the
custome of that Empire. To bee short, he was most
respectiue and heedie in all his expences as well ordinarie
as extraordinarie, those only excepted which
he laide out vpon his women, who (although they
were his slaues) yet was it his pleasure, that when
they departed from his entertainement, and embracement,
they should bee greatly enriched, and
well furnished with Iewels.
            To all these things before rehearsed, there may
be added a matter,Yearly Tributes of Christian princes to the great Turke. which without teares cannot bee
remembred, and that is, the tributes (or rather to vse
a more modest name for it, the Beneuolences and Gratuities)
which the Christian Princes do vsually giue
to the great Turke. The memorie whereof ought
to enkindle, yea and enflame them with a most iust
disdaine and indignation against so barbarous and
vniust a tyrant, and to cause them, that (as indeede
they doe in their consciences acknowledge it to bee
more profitable for Christendome, and honourable
for themselues:) so they would all ioyne togither
with one consent to spend the same money for the
glorie of Christ, and for there owne safetie.
         
         
            § XLV.
            THe Christian Emperour payed vnto the Turke
for Hungarie,The Emperor and to haue peace with him (if I do



well remember my selfe) fortie and fiue thousande
Dallers.
            The Vaiuode of Moldauia paieth one and thirtie
loades of Aspres,The Vaiuode of Moldauia. or little lesse. A hundred
thousand Aspres make a loade, which at the time of
the imposition make two thousand Crownes, euerie
Crowne being worth fiftie Aspres, which is now
worth more then a hundred. And besides, he payeth
also to the Tartarian twentie Cart-loades of honie,
with foure Oxen in euerie Cart, and fiftie Mares besides.
but it may be that by some new composition
he payeth now somewhat more or lesse.
            The Vaiuode of Walachia, before it was at the deuotion
of the Transiluanian Prince,The Vaiuode of Walachia. paied fiftie loads.
Such is the information that I haue had from such
as haue seene the bookes of Moldauia, and Walachia:
and therefore I do differ somewhat from those, that
haue written otherwise hereof.
            The Prince of Transiluania,The prince of Transiluania. payed to the Turke
before this present warre 15000. Cecchinoes or Duckets.
            The state of Ragugia payeth. 12500.The state of Ragugi. The state of Venice. Cecchinoes.
            The state of Venice, for the Iland of Zante (i. Zacinthus)
1000. Cecchinoes: as Selem also chalengeth a
certaine summe of money, before it was bereaued
of the Kingdome of Cyprus, because the Ottoman
Empire was somewhat entered into the Soldanes
accounts and reckonings.
            The Moscouite also gratifieth the Tartarian for
Taurica,The Moscouite. to auoyde the incursions, which the Tartarians
are wont to make into his Countrey, either of
themselues, or at the instance of the Turke.
            

               
The Polack payed to the Turke in the yeare 1591. so
many furs of Sables, as were worth 25000. crownes
of gold: but it is not a yearely tribute, as some haue
written. Indeed hee giueth to the Tartarian euerie
yeare a certaine summe of mony, to buy Scimitarres,
and apparell withall, by an auncient capitulation or
composition, as it is read in the Histories of Polonia.
            I haue noted also the giftes which some Princes
do bestow vpon the Tartarian, which although they
began at the first indeed, before the Turke had any
thing to doe with the Tartarian, are yet still continued
by the said Princes, principally to please the
Turke.
            There be also certaine tributes and giftes, which
the Princes of Africa, and of Arabia,The Princes of Africa, Arabia, and Georgia. and the Gergiani,
and others do vse to giue, but I wil omit them,
because they are not of any moment, nor serue any
thing to this present purpose.
            Finally, there be also many Rewardes and Gratuities,Gratuities extraordinary to the Turke and his Officers.
which the foresayd Princes do bestow extraordinarily
vpon the officers of that barbarous Prince
to keepe them to bee their friends: and which vpon
diuerse and sundry occasions they bestow also vpon
himselfe, either to holde him in friendship, or to pacifie
his rage and furie (which is sometimes eager in
deed, and somtimes but counterfaite) or else they
giue it for a certaine Ceremonie: because (as I haue
signified before) he doth account this kinde of profite
to be verie honourable vnto him. Besides that
all such as desire Offices and Dignities, or returne
from the gouernments of Prouinces, or from some
notable enterprice, do bestow vpō him (as it were by



bond and dutie) the godliest and most precious
things which they haue gotten: Neither is there
any other cause why his pleasure is that all the presentes,
which are offered vnto him, should thus openly
and in publike view be presented to his owne
presence, but onely with this barbarous pride and
ostentation to enflame and prouoke both his owne
subiects & strangers to bestow the more vpon him.
            The end of the first Booke.
         
      
      
         The second part.
         Wherein is treated of the purposes and Designments which
the Ottoman Princes haue towards other princes: Of
the cause of this present warre in Hungarie; the beginning
and proceeding thereof: wherein for your better
vnderstanding, the originall of the said warre shall be
fetched, euen from Amurath, the father of this now
liuing Mahomet.
         NOw that we haue seene the nature and
conditions of Mahomet, the heade and
chiefe of this Ottoman Empire, and
what are the members, strength, and
forces of this most monstrous bodie, as



I may call it: fit and conuenient it is: that for the
full and perfect knowledge thereof, we should goe
about to search the purposes and designements,
which the said Mahomet hath against other Princes,
and specially against the Princes Christian: to the end
we may the better vnderstand the true causes of this
present warre, togither with the beginning and proceedings
thereof. But forasmuch as this warre began,
euen in the time of Amurath, father to the now
liuing Emperour, it will be necessarie for our better
intelligence to speake somewhat of him, and to fetch
the true originall of the said war euen from thence:
wherewithall there shal be also discouered vnto you
more plainly, all the greatest interests and dealings
which hee hath with the rest of the Princes in the
world.
         
            § I.
            ANd to begin the same accordingly Amurath,
the Lord and Emperour of the Turkes father
to the now liuing Mahomet,The nature and conditions of Amurath the third. was a prince (of a Mahometane)
verie tollerable and discrete. He was a
zealous obseruer of that most vaine superstition of
the Mushaphum, (for so the Turkes call the Booke of
their law,The name of the Turkes Law-booke. as the Arabians tearme it the Al-koran:
that is to say most wickedly, as it were by excellencie,
, the Scripture, as though there were
none other Scripture like it: euen as the Iewes and
Hebrewes call the holy Scriptures, Kara.) He took
great delight also in reading the Hystories of his
predecessours, as Selim the first did the Hystories



of Alexander the great,Why Amurath was called Bongi. and of Iulius Caesar: and because
he was so studious in Philosophie, he was called
by the Turkes in mockage, Bongi, as Baiazet the
second was also called in the same respect. Hee was
no drinker of wine, as his father Selem was. In the
pleasures of sensualitie, which are so familiar and tollerable
among the Turks, he was rather cōtinent, thē
otherwise, especially in that most abhominable sin of
lecherie, and chiefly for many yeares before the end
of his life. Moreouer, if a man that is a niggard & avaricious,
may be called a louer of iustice, he was a
great louer of that iustice which is known amōg the
barbarians: very careful & desirous he was likewise to
vnderstand al the affairs of other princes, but aboue
all other things, most exact & perfit in the knowlege
of his owne estate: insomuch as he had a perticular
memoriall of all his businesse, of all his reuenues ordinarie
and extraordinarie, and of all his expences,
which he kept in a booke appointed by him for that
purpose, and layd continually vpon a little table in
his owne priuie Chamber, and came (as it were) by
inheritance to the now great Turke, euen as that of
Augustus came to Tiberius the Emperour. And it
may be peraduenture, that by reason of these his too
diligent occupations and businesses, or rather in
deed by his naturall inclination, he was for the most
part verie full of melancholie: which besides that it
made him somewhat still and sparing of speech, and
oftentimes irkesome and tedious to himselfe, it also
procured him to be exceedingly suspitious of any
matter:Why he did sometimes take Opium. so that to lighten and quicken himselfe, hee
did vse sometimes to take Opium: for the Turkes do



hold opinion, that the said Simple or Drugge doth
breed a good colour, and reioyce the heart, as also
that he who hath once eaten of it, cannot any more
abstaine from it. He entertained likewise in his Serraglioes
many Dwarffes and many dumbe persons,
whom hee would cause to fight togither one with
another, to the end hee might take some pleasure in
the sight of so vaine a pastime. Hee made warre rather
for religion and exercise of his people, then for
that he was giuen to warre by Nature: and that also
he folowed not by himselfe, but alwayes by his Officers.
For he would still glorie to himselfe, that hee
had enlarged the confines of his Empire, euen as
farre as the Caspian sea, only by his owne wit and aduise,
and by the execution and exployte of his saide
Captaines: a matter which his predecessors could
neuer performe or bring to passe in their owne persons.
He warred for the space of fifteene or sixteene
yeares with Mahomet Codabenda king of Persia, sonne
to Sha Tamas, who was the sonne of Ismael: and with
Abas, that liueth at this day, whom some doe falsly
call the Miriza:What Miriza is. for Miriza is the proper title of the
eldest sonne to the king of Persia, called Sophi, but is
not in deed the title of the king himself. He was wont
to say that he had fully resolued with himselfe neuer
to cōclude peace with him, vntil he had takē Casbin,
which now is the seate royall of the Persian kinges:The true causes why hee warred with the Persians.
& that for two causes. One was to recouer the ashes
of that Baiazet, who was sonne to Sultan Soliman, and
fled to Tamas to auoid the indignation of his father,
but was put to death by the same Tamas, to the end
he might by that meanes be reconciled to Soliman.



The other cause was to ruinate and vtterly destroy
the Sepulchre of Arduelle, father to Ismael, the Authour
of the Persian sect or religion:Why Ismael called Sophi. who was called
Sophi, either of the Greeke worde  (that is to
say wise) as though he had beene discended from the
auncient Magi, or Wise-men of Persia: or because
he was accounted and esteemed to be a Wise-man,
(as also for the same reason Sempronius was so called)
or else of the Arabian worde Sophi, which signifieth
wooll, because all the Persians doe weare a Tulpante
on their heades, not of verie fine linnin cloath as
the Turkes doe, but (to make shew of greater religion)
made of Woll,The Persians called Keselbassi. died into a red colour, wherevpon
they are by the Turkes tearmed in mockage,
Keselbassi, that is to say, Red-heades, or Red-Cappes:
that thereby they might make a difference from the
Tartarians of Zegatai, in times past called the Bactriani,
and dwelling beyond the Caspian sea, who because
they professe themselues to be of the right and
true discent of Mahomet,The Tarrarians of Zegatai called Ieschilbassi. doe vse to weare it of a
greene colour, and thereupon are called Ieschilbassi, i.
Greene Cappes.
            Now by the way: A Tulpante, and a Tocca is all one,
and signifieth that Globe or Sphere,What a Turbante is: and what it may signifie. full of Circles, great
and small, which are in the many turnings and wreathings
of those Linnen Rolles, which the Graecians of this time do
call , and serueth them both for a Cap, and a Hood.
And indeed properly it should be called a Turbante, of the
round shape thereof, tearmed by the Greekes  growing
sharpe in the top like vnto a Sugerloafe, or a Cypres tree, as
the Turkes were wont to weare it at the first: but now they
weare it more round. And thereupon it may be peraduenture



called in the holy Scriptures Pomum (that is to say,
an Apple) namely in the 79. Psalme, where King Dauid
bewayling the taking of the Citie Ierusalem, sayth, The
Temple of the Lord was giuen into the custodie of
Apples according to the vulgar and common translation,
which place certaine Writers not without some reason haue
interpreted to be ment of the Turkes. And so likewise it
may be, that not of Constantinople, but of the Persian
Kingdome, the Red-Apple is to be vnderstood, which the
Ottoman Emperour shall bring into his subiection, before
he be vtterly subdued by the sworde of the Christians, as is
to be red in the Turkish Oracle or Prophecie (if so it may
be called) and is now a long time knowne to euery man,An exposition of a Turkish prophecie. and
is by diuerse men diuersly interpreted Others there are, that
would expound the Turbante to be a Symbole or token of
Fortitude: whereby those that do weare the same should be
admonished, that when they go to the warres they should not
thinke to returne; but therein gloriously to die, whiles they
may remember that they carry with them the Syndon or
winding sheete, wherein they vse to wrap their dead carkasses.
The Giannizzaries do not weare the Turbante,The Iannizzaries Zarcola.
but a Zercola, which is of white Felt, and is iumpe of the
same fashion and shape, as may be seene in diuerse pictures,
to make a difference from the rest of the Turks, that weare
it of a red colour.
         
         
            § II.
            ANd now to returne againe.Why Amurath was content to be at peace with the Persians. At the last Amurath
was pacified with the Persian: but weary he was
and so were his people also, of so long a warre, and
therefore he might be well contented with this pacification



considering especially that hee had conquered
so much Countrey, and atchieued so great
glorie withall. Moreouer he thought also, that by
ths meanes hee might the more soundly establish
his state, and better secure the new Inhabitants,
which he had planted in his new conquered countreyes,
by distributing among them all the Timari,
that were to be raysed thereof, and by building diuerse
fontes therein, which should be cited and seated
in such maner as one of them might easily helpe
and succour the other.
         
         
            §. III.
            VVHiles Amurath thus enioyed this peace,
from which as being a man giuen to studie
and Melancholie, he did not of himselfe greatly
abhorre, he was counselled and aduised by his Visiers
to renue the warre.
            Now these Visiers are the chiefe counsellers of warre,Who the Visiers be.
and of estate: and the councell or assembly of these men,
is called by the Turkes Diuano, as hath beene before declared,
and not Capi,What the Porta is. that is to say, the Porta, which properly
is the Court; wherein is also in diuerse other thinges
the Turkes do imitate and follow the Persians, who (as ye
may read in Xenophon) did call the Court by that
name.
            The reasons wherby they moued & aduised him
to renue the warre,The reasons of the Visiers to moue Amarath to make warre. were these. Namely, that great
Empires & states cānot be maintained without the
helpe of force and armes: that as long as the common
wealth of Rome kept warres with the Carthagenians,



and the Emperours of Rome in Germanie,
that Empire lasted and continued. That so likewise
had the Ottoman Emperours done in times past, who
doe not holde the end of warre to bee peace, as the
Princes of Christendome, and other weake princes
doe, but they take the onely ende of warre to bee
warre, whereby the Turkes haue not onely amplified
and enlarged their Empire to that huge greatnesse,
wherein now it is, but haue also kept their subiects
occupied and busied: and so haue diuerted
them from ciuill seditions and insurrections, which
for the most part are bred & nourished by ease and
idlenesse. To be short, that the subiects, whiles they
continue in peace, some grow to be cowards, some
apply themselues too greedily to trades and traffike,
and some to spoyling and robberie, insomuch that
thereby there will be vtterly lost the knowledge of
the Sea-warres, which hath now a long time beene
almost abandoned, and of the land-warre also, if for
any long space they should ceasse to make warres.
And consequently they should want Captaines, and
valiant or hardie Souldiers, because the onely vse
of war doth inure men to become good warriours,
and maketh them exceedingly couragious. And
certaine it is, that matters which are atchieued and
gotten, are preserued by the same meanes whereby
they be gotten.
            Besides these Visiers and Bassaes, that laboured
to perswade him hereunto, in regard of their owne
interest and benefite, especially the two concurrents
and opposites Sinan and Ferat, who without warres
were held in no great credite, or account, nor could



enrich themselues according to the greedie desires
of the Barbarians: their were also the Agentes of
Fraunce, of England, and of the Prince of Geilan,
which endeuoured to perswade the same, by such
reasons, as shall be tolde you in due place.
         
         
            § IIII.
            BVt Amurath would not resolue vpon any thing:The reasons why Amurath would not resolue vpon warre.
not because he was not perswaded to make war,
but because hee was not throughly certified, what
aduantage would grow vnto him by mouing war,
rather against one prince then against another: & so
much the rather, for that the Visiers did differ in their
seuerall counsailes and aduises among themselues.
And for as much as their sundrie opinions did comprehend
the chiefest and most principall interests of
the world and specially of Christendom: I thought
with my selfe, that it woulde bee a matter not displeasing
to such as willingly shal read this discourse,
to relate them all in particular, and with such good
order and facilitie, as the reports themselues, and the
pronunciation of that barbarous tongue will suffer
me. And so by that meane I shall giue you a more
full and certaine knowledge of the Ottoman affaires,A note for Christian Princes.
and therewithall note also vnto our Princes the purposes
and designements of that tyrant, not onely
to the ende that they might in time looke about
them, and bethinke themselues of fit remedies for
the same, but also the sooner resolue, valiantly to
band themselues togither in one, for the vanquishing
and ouerthrow of him.
         
         
            
            § V.
            THeir opinions were eight in number. The first:The 8. seuerall opinions of the Visiers.
that in any case the warre should be renued agaynst
the Persian. The second: that they should
rather bend their forces against the king of Fez, and
Morocco. The third: against the Isle of Malta. The
fourth: agaynst the king of Spaine. The fift: against
the state of Venice. The sixt: agaynst Italie. The
seuenth: agaynst Polonia. And lastly, the eight against
the Emperours.
         
         
            § VI.
            THe reasons of their seueral opinions were these.The first opinion, to moue warre against Persia: and the reasons therof
And first, touching the renuing of the warre against
Persia (a kingdom which the Turks comprise
vnder the name of Azemia:) they argued, that when
soeuer the king should see the great Turk entangled
in other enterprises, he wold surely break the peace,
as well for the recouerie of his Country, which was
lost with smal honour & credite, as also to be reuenged
at one time or other, of all the olde griefes and
iniuries that he had receyued of the Ottoman Emperours.
That hee should be prouoked thereunto
and assisted therein by the Christian Princes, and
specially by the king of Spaine, who could verie wel
doe it by the way of the Indies, and by sending vnto
him (as at sundry other times he had done) enginers,
Gunners, and such other helpes. That the Countrey
was not yet well setled, the fortresses were new, and



the Inhabitants (lately planted) in great danger, and
somewhat too farre off, to be relieued in time. That
if the Persians would do nothing else, but ransacke
and forrage the Champaine, the said Inhabitantes
should be compelled and inforced to yeeld and giue
place, vnlesse they would perish for hunger. That
not to atchieue or obtaine, but to prosecute and follow
a victorie, is the true glorie. That the Turke
should take good heede, not to offend the great prophet
Mahomet, nor to moue him to indignation or
wrath, considering that he had obtained greater victories
agaynst the enemies of his Religion, then euer
his predecessors had obtained in former times: and
therefore it was fit and conuenient, and it was also
the dutie of a religious and thankefull prince, not to
omit the iniuries that were done both to God and
man. There was added to this, that Vsbegh-Han had
voluntarily offered to serue him in this warre, and so
had the prince of Geilan also.
            This Vsbegh-Han, is the Prince of those Tartarians,Who Vsbegh-Han is.
that dwell at the furthest ende of Persia, in that part which
the Turkes do call at this day Bahera, in olde time Bactra,
and are called Ketzie-Bassi,What Tartarians are called Ketzie-Bassi and why? because they weare Caps covered
with felt. It is not long ago since the said Vsbegh
died, and left behind him a sonne, who may now be about
some twelue yeares of age.Where Geilan is. Geilan, is also a Countrey more
toward the East of the Caspian sea.
            Moreouer, that he need not to make any doubt of
victorie, considering the good successe that he hath
had heretofore. That hee had no cause to feare their
Harquebuses: for they had but few, and the Turkes
can better handle them then the Persians: nor yet



their horses, although they were of the Arabian and
Caramanian race, the relikes of Amurath the second,
for they had many times and often bin put to flight
for verie cowardise. And lastly, that hee could not
doubt, least the Gurgini (so doe the Turkes call the
Georgiani,The Georgians. in times past the Iberi) should make any
stirre in aide and fauour of the Persians. For part of
them are his owne Subiects, and vnder the iurisdiction
of the Bassaes of Teflis, and of other places thereabouts,
after they were made Bassalucches by Mustapha:
part also of them are his tributaries: and it is
well knowne, that the rest are contented to liue vnder
their Lordes, Simon and Alessandro, without attempting
to seek better fortunes, but to defend their
owne Countrie. Which although it be but small,
and not verie hard to be kept and defended, yet is it
verie strong by situation, and almost vnpassible, for
the Mountaines, for the Woods, and for the straite
places that compasse it about.
         
         
            § VII.
            TOuching the second opinion,The 2. opinion to make war vpon the king of Fez and Morocco, and the reasons thereof. which was for
the bending of their forces against the Siriffo in
Africa, it was thus debated. That it was a great dishonour
to the Ottoman Empire, that they had not as
yet ouerthrowne and subdued those Moores. That
it was as great a shame, that they had so small a portion
in Africa, considering that it was the third part
of the world, and being so neare vnto Italie, did so
greatly vexe and trouble the Romanes. That Algier
and Tunise would neuer be secure, nor the Subiects



and Sea-rouers thereof satisfied, vntill they had gotten
the full rule and dominion of that kingdome.The cape of Aguera. The hauen of Araza.
That if they wholy reduce into their power and
possession the Cape of Aguero, and the Hauen of
Araza or Larace (which indeede is situate without
the straite, and not within it as some haue written)
places verie fit and conuenient for the English, that
get many booties in those seas, as also for diuerse others
both friends and enemies to the Moores, the
Turkish nauigation should be thereby the more secured.
That this king of the Moores, although he be
a Mahometane, and a Tributarie to the Ottoman Empire,
yet verie lately he had held secrete intelligence
with the King of Spaine, and also with the knights
of Malta, who by means thereof were like to to haue
taken Tripoli: and that hee had likewise maintained
and assisted the insurrection of Marabut, and of his
successour.The rebellion of Marabut. That though he were mightie for men,
yet he was poore in mony. And lastly that although
the Spaniards do holde in Africa,Certaine places which the Spaniards hold in Africa. Maraschebir, Oran,
the Pegnon, Tanger, Arsilla, Mazagan, and Ceuta, or
Septa and therefore may combine themselues with
the Moores to the great domage of the Turkes: yet
notwithstanding they might bee brideled with an
Armada of shippes, and by passing also if need were,
euen into Spaine.Tunise and Goletta. And withall, that the examples
of Tunise, and Goletta, which was held to be impregnable,
and yet was taken by Sinan, to his exceeding
glorie, were so fresh in memorie, that they could not
choose but remember them.
         
         
            
            § VIII.
            TOuching the third opinion,The third opinion to conquer Malta, and the reason thereof. which was for the
sending of an Armada to conquer the Isle of
Malta, it was said: that considering the Mahometanes,
both in their traffikes, and also in their pilgrimages,Pilgrimage to Meka.
as they went to Mecca, receiued most notable
losses by the Gallies of those knightes: the great
Turke ought to commaund that in any case order
might be taken to secure that voyage, not onely for
religions sake, but also to bee auenged of the trespasses
and wrongs alreadie done vnto them, or rather to
recouer the glorie of Soliman, who in vain, and without
any good successe attempted to surprise it. That
all the Subiects cried out and Exclaimed for the inlarging
and deliuerie, some of their friends, & some
of their kinsfolkes that were there in captiuitie: saying,
that so did their forefathers,The Isle of Rhodes. when they spoyled
and depriued the same knights of the Isle of Rhodes,
the chiefe fortresse and defence of the Christians in
the East. Moreouer, that they deserued due chasticement
also, aswell because they had furnished those
that rebelled against the grand Turke in Africa, with
munition of warre: as also because they endeuoured
to surprize Modone on a sodaine.
         
         
            § IX.
            TOuching the fourth opinion,The fourth opinion against the king of Spaine: and the reasons thereof. which was to
moue warres against the King of Spaine, it
was said: that if the Ottoman Empire were determined



to attaine the Monarchie of the whole
world, it was not possible to be atchieued, vnlesse the
mightines of that Prince were first weakened, who
without al doubt was the greatest both for state and
riches that Christendome had. That it could not be
feared least the said King of Spaine should assault
Algieri,Algieri. for that it was now a great deale better fortified
then it was in the time of Crai the Spaniard: (for
so by a Sclauoinetearme,How the Turks call Charles the fift. the Turks of the Court do
call Charles the fift.) That although Spaine should
take courage to enterprise such a matter, in regarde
of the losses which it receyueth continually by the
Pyrates of Africa, yet it would be restrained from so
doing for verie feare, least it should bring an Armada
of enemies into those seas, who might peraduenture
endomage it greatly. That the Spanish Gallies
would not hazard themselues to come into the Leuante,
because they woulde not bee so farre from
home. Moreouer, that the resolutions of that King,
either in regard of his many businesses, or in some
other respect are verie slowe. And as it is manifestly
seene by that which they did at Preuesa, and Nauarino,
the Spaniards doe vtterly refuse euen for their
owne commoditie and benefite to encounter with
the Ottoman forces. That the said King of Spaine
walketh with great cōsideration: for (if it be true) in
the latter end of the Persian war, he denied to aid the
king of Persia, when hee might haue succoured him
as before he had done. That although he would peraduenture
stirre in defence of himselfe, and his state
against the Turkish forces, yet he could not so doe in
deede: considering that he is so greatly occupied in



the maintenance of Flanders,How greatly the king of Spaine may be troubled with the Moores, the French, & the English. and recouerie of the
lowe Countries▪ which are verie strong both in regarde
of the Sea flouds, and of the many riuers that
are therein: and so much the more troubled hee is,
by reason of the obstinate and constant resolution
of that people, for the preseruation of their libertie
and religion: and likewise in respect of the great enmitie
which is betweene that king and the Queene
of England, who doth greatly ease that warre, by
troubling him in his state of Portugall, by intercepting
his treasures of the Iudies, and by sacking his
kingdomes, as particularly she did at the Groine,
which is a place of verie great importance to annoy
Spaine, to disturbe the nauigation of the Indies,
and also to attempt diuers other places in that other
nauigation of the Ocean. Moreouer, that he was so
farre interessed in the wars of France, that he could
not wholy turne himselfe any whither else.How the king of Spaine may be diuerted to the Persian Gulfe. To bee
short: that suppose he be reconciled, and at peace
with the said princes, so that with more safetie and
ease hee might attend this principall enterprise in
tended against him, yet might the Turke damnifie
him in his Spices and other Marchandizes, yea, and
(if neede were) he might diuert him into the Red-sea,
otherwise called the Persian Gulfe, by meanes of
the Gallies, that lie so conueniently and commodiously
for that purpose at Suez: or hee might surprise
some good fortresse of his, as was attempted against
the Portingales for Diu, and Ormuz, and as
Alfonso d' Albuguerque, the Portugall Viceroy in the
Indies, thought once to haue done,Alfonso d' Albuquerque. when he meant
to haue stollen away the bones of Mahomet, by a



sodaine incursion into the Countrey with certaine
light horsemen, euen as farre as Mecca: and as it was
done at other times, while the Soldans reigned: and
also as Tratan the Emperour was minded to haue
done in his time. Againe, that the passages into Africa
might be much troubled, especially if the Turke
would set vpon the Spanish coast in the Mid-land
sea, which would bee a great contentment to the
subiects, who doe continuallie make humble petition
and supplication for it, as well in regard of the
safetie of their traffique and pilgrimages, as also that
the poore Moores might once bee deliuered from
the dominion of the Spaniard,The Moores wearie of the Spanish gouernment. as Selim at the lest
was perswaded to haue done. And so much the rather,
for that the said Moores, who are now multiplied
into a great number, although they keepe
close both for feare, & also for their traffique, whereby
they are growen to bee verie rich, yet as well by
nature, as also for Religion, doe beare a mortall hatred
against the Spaniards. Moreouer, that this
course might easily bee performed by reason of the
conueniencie of the hauens in Africa, which lie neer
at hand: and also because the said Princes of Fraunce
and England, haue offered to continue their warres,
with him: the King of France, by disquieting him
in the parts of Nauarra, for the chalenge which hee
hath thereunto: and the Queene of England (as it
hath beene said) not onely by setting vpon him in
the West Indies, and in the Ocean, which she may
doe both by North and by West, but also by raising
againe some new stirres in Portugall, where there
doth not want great store of Mal-contents. For that



people doth thinke, that with the losse of their last
king, they haue also lost all their wealth and prosperitie:
because that as vnder his gouernment they grew
rich by the peace that he intertained with the said
princes of France and England: so vnder the Spaniards
dominion they do find, that by the warres they
liue in continuall perils and daunger. Againe, there
be many banished and discontented persons, not
onely of the kingdome of Portugall, but also of the
kingdome of Aragon in France, in England, and in
Constantinople, who togither with many Moores,
(which also were in Constantinople) haue offered
many aydes and helpes both secretly and openly:
and haue promised that the enterprise will be verie
easie, when so euer Spaine shall be set vpon, especially
if it bee done vpon a sudden. For the greatest
part of that kingdome doth want the vse of militarie
knowledge:Spaine not well exercised in militarie knowledge. because the people of that Countrey do
not applie themselues to armes, neither are there any
ordinarie bands of Souldiers ouer all the realme:
and but a small number of horses neither. Moreouer,
that the Subiects, which Spaine sendeth forth into
the Indies, into Flanders, and into Italie, are so manie
in number,Spaine wanteth men. as they doe greatly weaken it: yea,
so much, that if occasion should so fall out, it should
not onely want helpe of their owne, but also should
stand in need to be relieued with the ayde and assistance
of other states that are neere vnto them, and
subiects of the same crowne, who peraduenture
would proue to be of no great good seruice, and so
much the lesse, because they may easily be stopped,
and diuerted some other way.
         
         
            
            § X.
            THe fift opinion,The fift opinion, to break peace with Venice: & the reasons therof. was to breake the peace with
the state of Venice: For this said they, which endeuoured
to perswade the great Turks mind thereunto,
rather with apparent reasons, then with such
as were true in deede: (though peraduenture, euery
man easily beleeuing that which he desireth, they might
seeme verie probable and likely to the Turkes:) that
no enterprise happily would proue lesse hard and
difficult then this, as it might be found by the experience
and examples of such actions as had passed
heretofore: especially seeing the Turkes not many
yeares agoe hauing warred with the Venetians, and
surprised somewhat of theirs, had receiued many
and great satisfactions at their hands to make peace
with them. That the said Common-wealth & State
of Venice, accounting peace to be the end wherat it
shooteth, it should seeme that the people is timerous
and cowardly, and by their ancient ordinances
and customes, do neuer prepare themselues to war,
but when they are drawne vnto it by force: that peraduenture
they will thinke to be ouercome, before
they looke for it, as it fell out with them for the kingdome
of Cyprus. That if the said state would make
resistance by it selfe alone, perhaps it hath not forces
sufficient: if ioyned in confederacie with others,The king of Spaine cannot helpe Venice against the Turke. it
could not performe any great matter in haste, by
reason of the many difficulties, that depend vppon
leagues: and namely of the seuerall cogitations and
interestes, wherewith the Spanish king is now intangled:



in regard whereof it was inforced at last to
make peace with Selem. Moreouer, that it was a hard
matter, if not impossible, that the said king, being so
greatly occupied in his other warres, could at this
time ioyne in league with that state: and also that
without him all other confederacies, to ake warre
by Sea, were of no importaunce or consideration.
And as for the Pope, though it be very likely, that he
will do al that possibly he can do,What reliefe the Pope can yeeld to Venice. to keepe the Christian
princes from annoying the said state, but rather
will aduertise and admonish them to ayde and
succour it: yet the most that he can doe himselfe is
onely that he may yeeld it some assistance, either of
moneys, or of some Ecclesiasticall profites, or else
peraduenture hee may send to ioyne with their Armada,
his fiue Gallies, which togither with the Gallies
of Malta, of Sauoy, and of Florence, can make no
mo but twentie in all, at the most. And besides, that
the said state of Venice hath not happily that good
intelligence, with all the rest of the Christian princes,
which in such a case were needfull for it, (but
the Turkes are therein greatly deceiued.) And to be
short, seeing it hath spent great store of golde in discharging
the debtes of the Treasurie, whereinto it
had runne by the last warres, and by building many
fortresses, it will be found peraduenture not so well
prouided and furnished with money. And lastly,
that all that state being verie full of forts, it is impossible
at one time to keepe them all well fenced,
and sufficiently strengthned.Diuersitie of opinions among the Bassaes, how and where to annoy Venice.
            
            But for as much, as it seemed, that the greatest part of
the Visiers did concurre in this opinion, but yet varied among



themselues, how to attempt this enterprise: I will set
downe their differences in particularitie.
            Sinan the Albanian,Sinan and his death. of Topoiano, a town of the Sangiaccheship
of Preseremo, who died the last yeare of
a naturall death, but peraduenture somewhat discontented,
because the warre of Hungary succeeded
not according to his mind: (and yet some thinke rather
that he died of poyson:) hee perswaded, that
Corfu should be attempted, vnder the pretence of 3.
hundred Duckats a yeare, due to the Emperiall
Chamber of Turkie,He perswadeth to attempt Corfu. euer since the yeare 1537: for
La Bastia, because it was yeelded to the Corfiottes but
vpon that condition.
            La Bastia is a wast and desert place, being vnder a
towne of the Turkes in Epirus,La Bastia. twelue miles right ouer against
Corfu, neare to the Salt pittes, which are in the
Turkes possession at the mouth of the riuer Calamatta:
and is the principall port and Staple for the Marchandizes,
which come from a great part of Greece, to bee imbarked
at Corfu.
            But in verie deed Sinan endeuoured to perswade
this attempt, because the Fortresse of Corfu was
thought to be vnuanquishable, both by Nature and
by Arte: and hee being exceedingly ambicious to
atchieue the name and title of a great Conquerour,
was so bold and hardie, especially vpon the exployte
which he did at Goletta, as to promise to himselfe a
verie easie conquest of this also: as in truth hee did
not sticke to vaunt that he could performe it, when
he passed by Corfu,Goletta▪ in his victorious returne from the
enterprice of Goletta.
            Ferat, who was called Carailam, that is to say, the



Black-Serpent,Ferat Bassa, & his death. and died also the last yeare, being by
Mahomet caused to bee strangled: (how wisely and
considerately, I leaue to the iudgement of those that
vnderstand matters of state better then I do.) For he
was accused to haue practised intelligence with the
Tartarian of Crimo, that he should refuse to come
to the Turkish campe, because Ferat himselfe was
not Generall thereof: and to haue endeuoured also
a reconciliation for Michael the Vaiuode, and the
Trāsiluaniā, both at one time, by giuing the court to
vnderstād that they had not rebelled for any hatred
which they caried indeed against the Turks, but rather
vpon an indignation conceiued agaynst Sinan.
Al which he laboured onely of purpose to bring the
said Sinan into disgrace, whom hee helde to bee his
most capitall enemie, because hee was made Masul,Ferat degraded.
that is to say, hee was degraded, for the tumult and
stirre that fel out betweene the Iannizzaries and the
Spahoglanes, at the circumcision of the now-reigning
Turke. This Ferat aduised, that Catharo should bee
conquered,He aduertiseth to attempt Catharo. because he thought that the saide Fortresse
did keepe Castell Nuouo (as it were) in bondage,
and that it was the principall key of Dalmatia,
of the Adriatike Sea, and of Venice.Andronig. And also that hee
being borne at Adronici, a Castell of Albania, could
verie well know euen from his yongest yeares, that
the said Fortresse, which is famous in that prouince,
was of so great importance, as in truth it is.
            I haue somewhat inlarged this Discourse of the particulars
touching Sinan and Ferat, because I haue had occasion
many times (as I shall also haue hereafter) to make
mention of them, as the most principall men in this Empire,



and in this warre.
            Sinan Cicali,Sinan Cicala perswadeth to attempt Cerego. an errant enemie to the state of Venice,
for the reasons which we haue aboue alledged,
he perswaded that Cerigo should bee attempted, for
the selfe-same causes, for which he calleth it the Lanterne
of the Archipelago, and the spie of the Turkish
actions, especially for that it is manifestly perceiued
and seene: how the Christians may easily passe ouer
into Morea, out of this Island. So did Damaratus king
of the Lacedemonians,Demaratus K. of Lacedemonians. when he was banished out of
his kingdom, aduice and counsell Xerxes, that if he
would attaine to the Lordship and gouernment of
Greece, hee must possesse himselfe of this Island
which at this time was called Cythera.
            Other Bassaes there were,Other Bassaes perswade the attempt of Nouigrade and Zara. which held opinion,
that to be reuenged of the spoyles and robberies
committed by the Vscocchi (of whom I will speake
somewhat hereafter) and to meete with other their
wrongs and iniuries, they should surprize Nouigrad
and Zara: or at the least, that the Venetians should be
inforced and of necessity constrained by that means
to be bound, to pay al the losses and damages which
those rouers and theeues had wrought against the
Turkes, both by land and by sea. For the Venetians
had denied to be bound to make any such recompence,
because in the publike Bookes and Registers
of Constantinople, there was not to bee found any agreement,
or any payment for the same, as in truth
there was not.The fishings of Butintro. The same Bassaes also were of opinion,
that it were fit the Venetians should bee spoyled
and bereaued of their Fishings at Buthroto, which
at this day is corruptly called Butintro, (a place directly



ouer against Corfu, and ten miles somewhat
more West of La Bastia. (Wherunto they were moued,
not because the Turkes were neuer heretofore
possessed of them (although the Venetians had possessed
the same, long before the Turkes had any possession
in Albania) but onely because there runneth
a rumour among them, that the said fishings are rented
at a hundred thousand duckats, where as in deed
there is no more payed for them, then six thousand
or thereabouts.
            Some other Bassaes were of opinion, that the
Turkish fleete should vpon a sodaine go forth with a
good wind,Others perswade to attempt the coasts of the Adriatike sea. either from Morea, or from the gulfe of
Lepanto, or from Preuesa, or else from Velona, and run
all along the coastes of the Adriaticall sea, with a
full resolution to surprise that part that should bee
found most cōuenient and commodious for them.
Which course they did thinke would very easily sort
to verie good purpose, because they presumed, that
all the places which lay vpon the sea, might verie
fitly bee annoyed also vpon the land, for that the
Turkes haue almost all that Countrey in their possession.
These Bassaes likewise aboue all other attempts,Others Pola.
propounded the easinesse and also the great
importance of possession Pola, and Ragugia. The one
because it is a Citie, which is altogither disinhabited,
and hath a verie faire hauen, and is situate in
Istria, and is also a prouince not verie wel furnished
with Souldiers and inhabitants, nor greatly strengthened
or fenced with Fortresses: and principally, because
it seemeth that the said City of Pola, is not distant
from Venice, aboue a hundred and twentie



miles. And the other, that is to say Raegugia, because
it is (as it were) the second Gate,Others Ragugi. (for the first and
chiefest is thought to bee Corfu) whereby you
may enter into the Maritimall and Sea-state of
the Venetian Common-wealth in the Adriaticall
sea, and also because the situation therefore, is most
fit and conuenient for preparation to be made therein,
for annoying of Italie, if they should meane so to
do in good earnest: especially, for that the state of
Rugugia hath within it most safe and spacious portes
and hauens, whereof indeed the Turke hath great
want in that quarter of the sea.
            For Durazzo hath not any hauen able to receiue
foure Gallies,What ports the Turke hath in the Adriatike sea. and also in the entrance thereof, there
are many flattes and shelfes which are verie daungerous.
Twelue miles beyond Durazzo, vnder the
Cape or Promōtorie of Lacchi, there is an other harborough
for twenty gallies, or there aboutes, but it is
not verie safe: neither are there any great good waters
about it. In the Gulfe of Velona, there is also an
other harborough vnder the land for so many gallyes
likewise. Somewhat nearer on this side, about
some eight miles, is the Hauen called Porto Raguseo,
where may lodge some thirtie Gallyes, but not verie
safely on the North, on the Northwest, nor on the
West. Without the Gulfe, at least in the coast of
Albania, or rather within the Gulfe (for the ancient
Authours doe bound the Adriaticall Sea with the
mountaines of Cimmeria) there is first the Hauen of
Santi quaranta (i. the fortie Saints) where likewise
they may entertaine some few Gallyes. And a little
on this side of that, is Neribo, sometimes called Orico:



where the Romanians touched, when they departed
from Ottranto, to the end they might afterwards
saile all along that coast. And this Hauen is able to
receiue fortie Gallies: but it is not verie safe. The
onely hauens of Ragugia, which be fiue or sixe,The hauen of Santa Croce. are of
the greatest receyte: in three whereof especially in
the Hauen of Santa-Croce, there may be intertained
and harboured all the Armadaes of the world, much
more the fleete of the Turkish Shippes. The same
place also is verie fit and conuenient for the Turkes,
because they may easily conueigh thither their timber
for ships, from the Mountaines of the Ducagini
in Albania: which cannot so commodiously
be brought into the other portes aboue mentioned
as I haue somewhat more at large declared in other
writings that I haue penned vpon the occasion of
this warre.
            But the greatest part of the Visiers enclined most
to the attempt of the Isle of Candie,Others perswade to attempt the Isle of Candie. for (said they)
seeing it is most necessarie to secure the nauigation,
which the Turkes continually make from Constantinople
to Alexandria, for Marchandises, and for deuotion
to Mecca, that they might bee safe from the
Gallies of Spaine, of Malta, and of Florence, it could
not otherwise bee brought to passe,What the Emirs are, and why they wear a greene Turbante. but by one of
these two wayes, as a captain of the Emirs once said.
(These Emirs professe thēselues to be of the right & true
descent from their Law giuer Mahomet, and therefore
they weare a greene Turbante:) that is to say, eyther by
binding the Venitians, that they shall not onely forbeare
to giue entertainment to the saide Gallyes
within there Seas, but also make satisfaction for all



losses, that the Turkes shall sustaine, as often as they
shall not safely guarde their said ships from all such
dangers. Or else by causing the Venetians to suffer
and permit a good companie of Turkish Gallyes to
be resident at Candie for that purpose. Herevnto
they added also, that this attempt would proue the
better, & come to good successe, because that kingdome
is diuided in it selfe, by reason of the difference
which is betweene the Greeke Religion, and
the Latine, and for the great discontentments, which
some (but falsly and vainly peraduentur) do report,
to be growen betwene the noble men of Venice,
and the Noble men of Candie, betweene those that
are priuiledged persons, and those that are tied to
impositions and taxes, and betweene the Clownes
and the Gentlemen there. And so much the rather,
for that it is a verie easie matter to set vpon it with a
Turkish Armada, seeing it is (as it were) compassed
about with Natolia, with Caramania, with Barbarie,
with Alexandria, with Morea, and with the Arcipelago,
which are all Countreys belonging to the Turkish
Empire: so that they may easily from hand to
hand ayde and succour those that should first attempt
to disturbe therein. Moreouer, that by the
purchase and winning of this most fruitfull Island,
they should obtaine the absolute commaund and
rule of the Sea, for that it is (as it were) the verie Center
in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, or rather
of the world, considering that it is almost equally
distant in situation from Asia, Africa, and Europe,
so that it was by the auncient Authours adiudged
the most fit and conuenient seate of all the worlde.



And this also might so much the more easily bee
brought to passe, for that thereby the number of
the Venetians Galleyes should be diminished, and
the Ottoman Empire should encrease the meanes to
make many moe Gallyes, then now they haue. Lastly,
seeing there are many Candiotes remayning in
Constantinople, they may haue good information,
and some aide also of them, and so much the more,
because many of them are banished persons, and
haue eyther withdrawne themselues into that Citty
to get their liuings, by labouring in the Arsenall, and
in Pera, or else are come thether with marchandises,
and specially their most pretious wines, which they
bring thorough the Greater Sea▪ and from thence to
the mouthes of the Danowe, and so to Chilia,The waye how the Muscadels of Candie are conuayed into Polonia, Moscouie & Germanie. to Galaz,
to Rene, euen to the Floz in Walachia, and then
in Cartes into Polonia: For into Germanie they are
brought, not by that way (as some write) but by the
Ocean to Hamburgh, and to Lubeke, and some fewe
to Danske: and yet there are some carried thether
also by the way of Venice.
         
         
            §. XI.
            THE Sixt opinion was,The Sixt opinion to attēpt Italie, and the reasons thereof. that leauing all these other
courses and enterprises, all the Forces, that
the Turkes could make aswel by Land, as by Sea,
should be sent against Italie: And the reasons were
these, That if they were minded indeed to attempt
the conquest of the Monarchie of the worlde, the
Turkish Empire should neuer attaine vnto it, vnlesse
it first obtayned the Rule and Lordshippe of Italie:



because out of that Prouince, as from the Centre of
the vniuersal world there doe proceed all the counsels
and principall assistances, that may hinder and
crosse the proceedinges which are attempted elsewhere.
That the Romanes became to bee Lordes
and Maisters of the world, because they had the gouernment
of Italie in possession. That the Hunnes
did alwayes direct all their designementes to that
onely end, when they passed into Italie out of Hungaria,
by Dalmatia, and by Carso. That the Alanes
and the Gothes,The Romans. The Hunnes. The Alani. The Gothes. The Vandales. aswell those that dwelt on this side, as
those also on the other side of the Danowe, after they
had conquered Grecia, entred into Italie by the waye
of Bosna and Croatia. That the Vandales also, hauing
subdued Spaine, went thether with an Armada
of shippes out of Africa: And lastly, That the Germanes,
the Frenchmen and the Spaniardes,The Dutch. The French. The Spanish. The Saracens. had oftentimes
done the like. Moreouer, that the Saracens
(of whome it was wont to bee said in the Romanes
times, that it was very conuenient either not to haue
them enemies, or to keepe them friendes,) had ouerrunne
it all thorough, kept it a long while in their
possession, and sacked Rome it selfe, the Ladie and
Empresse of the world: A Citty, which (as Sultan
Soliman very fondly sayed according to the reporte
of Iouius) did of right belong to the Ottoman Empire,The foolish speech of Soliman touching Rome.
because it was alienated by Constantine, to the
great preiudice of his successors. To bee short, that
there could no enterprise be attempted, either more
glorious or more profitable, then this of Italie, for
that it is the Prouince, which is Queen of al the rest,The praise of Italy.
for conueniencie of scituation, for temperature of



ayre for fruitfulnesse for all thinges necessarie for
mans life, for the maiestie and beautie of so many
most famous and noble Cities, for riches, for the verie
Sea, and seate of the Christians religion, for the
auncient Glorie and mightinesse of that Empire,
and for many other respects. That it would also bee
a verie easie matter to bring to passe, for that Italie
is at this day ruled and gouerned by manie Princes
which are diuided among themselues, as well in regarde
of their owne priuate interestes, as also of seuerall
nations, whereof they are proceeded: and that
peraduenture they are not all verie willingly and louingly
obeyed of their Subiects and peoples, who
by reason of the peace, which they haue so many
yeares enioyed, will proue to be but cowards and
weakelings: and for that also they are growen to
such a huge multitude, as if entraunce should bee
made into the Countrey, either in one part or in
many, at such times as their corne were yet ripening
in their fields, as the Turks should on their behalfes
want no vittailes, so should the Italians be of necessitie
constrained either to shut vp themselues within
their fortresses, or else to perish for hunger. Which
thing will be made more manifest and cleare, if yee
shall consider, that now whiles they liue in peace,
they haue not corne sufficient for their sustenance,
but are enforced to prouide the some abroad, and to
cause it to be brought to them from Morea,How the Italians prouide themselues of Corne. from
Constantinople, and euen as farre as from the Ocean.
Moreouer, that the Italians are accustomed for the
most part to procure their liuings with handi-crafts,
or with traffique, in such sort, as if their trades were



hindered, they should bee compelled so much the
rather to yeeld to such conditions as the conquerour
shall impose vpon them, or at least to become tributaries,
and acknowledge the Ottomans power. And
besides, that the Turkish Souldiers would willingly
goe thither, because they are not to passe through
Countryes, which are barren, frozen with Ice, and
disinhabited, or through thicke bushes and woods,
or mountains vnpasseable, but as it were in the sight
of their own houses, and through their own proper
Countryes. And lastly, that if the Turkes haue entered
therinto at other times, when their borders and
confines were not so conuenient, nor so near as now
they are: much more may they, or rather ought to
attempt the same at this time, seeing they haue them
now so nigh and commodious.
         
         
            § XII.
            THE seauenth opinion was that they should
make war first in Polonia,The seuenth opinion, to warre against Polonia, and the reasons thereof. and then afterwardes
in Hungarie and Germanie. The reasons thereof
were these: That forasmuch as it did not stand
with the dignity of the Ottoman maiesty, to suffer the
king of Polonia so often to refuse the payment of his
Tribute, it was very fitte, that all forcible meanes
should bee vsed to recouer the same. That for the
many discontentmentes, which haue passed in that
Kingdome, there was very good hope that hee
might the more easily bee enforced to pay it. That
the warre should be verie conuenient and commodious
for the Turkes, because Polonia was so neare, &



bordered vpon Moldauia, and vpon the Tartarians,
and also vpon the Sangiackeshippes of Achermano, &
of Bendero, and vpon Vosia. Againe, That the entier
and quiet possession of Moldauia, and Walachia,
could neuer be kept & maintained, vnlesse the hardie
boldnes of the Polackes were brideled: and so
much the more for that the Vaiuodes of those prouinces,
although they were greately enriched, yet
could they neuer recouer thēselues in any distresse,
nor bee relieued any where but in the Turkes kingdome.
That by these meanes also the iniuries
might bee reuenged, which were wrought against
the Turkes by the Cosacchi, when they sacked Coslou,The Cosacchi Coslou.
a place in Taurica belonging to the Turkish state: that
therby likewise the passage should be eased for their
Marchandises, that goe from the Turkish States into
Moscouie: that the Moscouite himselfe should bee
put in a bodily feare, (and that peruaduenture to his
great losse and domage) because his Countrey laye
so neare, especially, considering that hee was the impediment,
why the Ottoman Empire atchieued
not the to rall conquest of Persia. That growing in
this sort so nigh unto Germanie, it may bee that one
onely discomfiture would vtterly ouerthrow the
Emperour, for that hee should see his Countrey the
more easily compassed about with the Ottoman Forces:
That to bee short, all the Countrey of Polonia
is very open and without Fortresses, and that the
Polackes themselues were not now to bee accounted
any great warriours, because they haue liued so long
in peace. For the wars which they made with Maximilian
were but of small continuance, and the other



warres which were made before by King Stephen
with the Muscouite, were made by him as hee was
an Hungarian, and rather with Hungarian Souldiers,
then with Naturall Polackes, and rather with besieging,
then with fighting.
         
         
            § XIII.
            THE eight and last opinion was,The eight opinion to war against the Emperor: and the reasons thereof. that warre
should bee made against the Emperour,
whome the Turkes call, The King of Betz, that
is to say, of Vienna, in times past peraduenture Vindoniana.
Those which were of this opinion, were
moued thereunto: for that the Vscocchi were become
so insolent in praying vpon the Turkes both
by land and by sea,The insolencies of the Vscocchi. as not only in regard of the losses,
which they continually wrought, but also euen for
the honour of the Ottoman maiestie, they could no
lōger be endured: & so much the rather, for that the
marchants subiect to the Turke, both to the publike
and to their owne priuate detriment, haue beene
constrained to change the Port of Narenta, and to go
to Spalato, a Countrey belonging to the Venetians,
to the end they might carrie their Marchandizes into
the Christians Countryes, and bring backe other
Marchandizes for them into Turkie. And yet they
could not by that course goe and come safe, neither
notwithstanding the peace, that hath beene continued
with the Emperour and the Venetians. Moreouer,
that they also ranne vp and downe by land,
stealing mens cattell, burning townes and villages,
and taking children euen out of the verie armes of



their naturall mother. So that there is great reason
to feare, least in time they wil be able to become the
Lordes and maisters of some neighbour-Fortresse,
which would be a matter that might turne, not only
to the great losse, but also much rather to the exceeding
shame and dishonour of the Ottoman Empire.
Againe, that forsomuch as the Emperour had
carried so slender a respect towards the grand-Turk,
whiles he was busied in the warres of Persia, as that
he delayed in deed for a long time to send him his
tribute:The easinesse of this warre. (for so the Turkes call it) hee made shew
thereby that hee was rather minded to breake the
peace, then to maintaine it. That the victorie would
proue both easie and certaine, for that on the one
side he might be assaulted in Croatia, and on the other
side in Hungarie, and in Austria. That the countrey
was fruitfull and abounding in all things, verie
commodious and fit for the Souldiers, both in regard
of the neerenesse thereof, and also because they
should passe thither (almost all the way) by their
owne houses. That the principall Holdes of the
Kingdome of Hungarie, namely Belgrado, Buda, and
Alba-Regale, and the rest that are of the greatest importance,
were possessed and garded vetie well with
the Turkish garrisons. And that although some discomfiture
might peraduenture happen, yet would
they be most conuenient receits for the Reliques of
the armie, where they may be as well defended and
preserued, as also repaired and renued with such
helpes and aydes, as are there nigh at hand. That
the Emperor seemed to be inclined rather to peace
then to warre: and it may be also, that hee is not so



well esteemed and obeied by all the Princes of Germanie,
as his degree requireth. That all the Princes
of Germanie were diuided, as well in regard of
their interest in Religion, and in state, as also particularly
in respect of the election of the Newe King of
Romanes. That they are almost wearie (as some of
the Protestant Princes doe seuerally reporte) of the
gouernement of the house of Austria: and that
they are also too much giuen to the loue of their
treasures and riches. And finally, that seeing there
are many yeares passed since the Germanes haue
handled neither Launce nor Arcubuse, they cannot
now tell how to take Armes, nor to vse them: besides
that they will hardly bee obedient to their Capitanes.
Lastly, That euen as the saide Almanes
themselues would alwayes dwell in murmur and
distrust with the Hungarians, with the Italians and
with the Spaniardes, as often as they should goe to
the warres together, because those nations are naturally
not well liked, (I will not say hated) by them:
So the sayde Dutchmen, being enemies among
themselues for the diuersitie of Heresies which they
follow, will alwayes bee afrayde, least if the Emperour
should obtaine the victorie and remaine Conquerour,
that then they shall bee compelled to forsake
their licentious liberty, and to obey the Pope:
So that there is no doubt, but that they will rather
forbeare to fight, then to helpe their prince and
themselues.The Emperour can haue no aid of other Princes. To bee short, that there could be no
feare of any aide or succours, which the Emperour
might haue of other princes. Not of the Polacke,
nor of the Transyluanian, aswell in regarde of the



peace, which is between the Great Turke and thē,
as also for that they will be in doubt, least they shold
drawe all the tide and force of the warre into their
owne States and Dominions. Besides, that the
one of them would be afrayde, least hee should bee
enforced to abandon the Frontiers, and retire himselfe
to the frozen Sea, and the other least he should
bee depriued of that Estate, which hee possessed by
the Graunt of the Ottoman House. Moreouer, that
the King of Spaine, who is the onely Man that can
helpe the house of Austria in deede, is otherwise imployed
and busied. That the pope cannot yeeld supply
for all, that shall bee needefull in this busines.
That the Italian princes will not runne in haste to
spend their Treasures, nor consume their subiectes
for an other mans benefite. And for conclusion,
That the State of Venice, doubting that it shoulde
thereby prouoke the Ottoman Forces against it
selfe, would rather stay to see the issue and successe
of the warre, then it would put it selfe to a certaine,
or at least to a doubtfull danger of ouerthrowing it
selfe.
            And these were the seuerall opinions of the
Visiers, inconsiderate no doubt for the most parte,
and agreeable to their barbarous temerity and rashnes,
whereby they faine vnto themselues that those
thinges are easie, which afterwardes by experience
they proue not onelie to bee difficult and hard, but
also very dangerous and pernitious.
         
         
            
            § XIIII.
            BVt for as much as my meaning is to satisfie those
also, that may in any sort doubt of the varietie
and truth of the things, which I haue spoken, I will
adde hereunto in briefe, how the Turkes come acquainted
with our matters, and how wee come acqainted
with theirs: though it be most certaine, that
the like consultations are proper to all Princes,The consultations of Soliman & Selim.
and particularly to the Ottoman Princes, as among
other examples, we know that Soliman, and the last
Selim, did vse the same, the one of them by examining
with his Bassaes the forces of all the Princes of
the world, and the other by aduising with them,
which might be the most certaine way to conquer
the Christians.
            Without doubt the great Turke,How the Turks come to the knowledge of our affaires. and the great
men of that Courte are verie well informed and aduertised,
aswell of all actions that daylie happen, as
also of the designementes and purposes, yea and
of the most secret counselles of our Princes, sometymes
by the merchauntes,Marchants slaues. which of all nations are
at Constantinople, and sometymes by the Slaues,
whom the Turks euery day. A great number wherof,
doe also verie oftentimes most impiously denie
and renounce the faith and religion of Christ, either
for rewards that are propounded and offered vnto
them, or else to auoyd the most horrible and cruell
punishmēt, which they had before endured at their
barbarous hands, or peraduenture for some other
end and purpose, as did of late yeares one of the



Emperours Secretarie, who was resident at Constantinople.The Emperors Secretarie became a Renegado The Jewes.
Besides that the Hebrues, who are the
most cunning and craftie searchers and inquirers of
matters, and most mortall enemies to the Christians
are dispersed in great number ouer all the Turkish
dominion, especially by reason of the traffique
which they vse continually in the Ottoman Market
townes, and also for the tolles and customes which
are almost wholy in their handes, through all that
state. And they thinke, that by seruing the Turkes
for spies and priers into our actions and affaires they
shall not only secure themselues of their goods, their
owne persons, and their children, but also that they
shall reape great gaine and commoditie of importance,
whereby they doe much gratifie and pleasure
the great estates of that Empire. The last war which
the Venetians had with the Turke, was much occasioned
by one Iohn Miches an Hebrew,Iohn Miches a Jew. who was discontented
with them, because hee could not by
stealth conueigh away certain marchandizes, which
vnder a forged name he had caused to be brought to
Venice.John Lopes a Jew. Of one John Lopez, an Hebrew also (whose picture
by order of the holie Inquisition was of late
yeares burned at Rome) it is most certainly knowne
for a truth, that hee imparted and commnnicated
with Amurath many secretes of Pope Xistus Quintus
which he by espiall had found and learned whiles
he remained in Rome. Lastly, it is not to be doubted,
but that the Turkes doe also keepe diuerse Spies in
pay,Spies among Christians. that are neare to al the Princes in Christendom:
yea (and that which is a great matter, but yet it is
true) euen among the Zwitzers, and Grisons of



purpose to vnderstand what leuies of Souldiers are
made of those peoples.
         
         
            § XV.
            ANd as touching our Christian Princes,How we come to the knowledge of the Turks affaires the expences
are most notorious and well knowne,
which they bestow, not onely to learne the counsels
one of another, (and that oftentimes to the great
shame and domage of those that serue them in these
actions) but especially and principally to vnderstand
the counsels and designements of the Turke their
common enemie. For those Princes which haue the
greatest interest and entercourse with him, do keep
(euen within the Citie of Constantinople) many Spies
in pay,Spies, Jewes and Turkes. yea giuing wages and stipends to the verie
Iewes, and also to such Turkes, as are most in trust,
and neerest in credite with the chiefe Bassaes, besides
the large gifts which they liberally bestow vpon others,
when they haue any matter of moment communicated
vnto them. Moreouer,The Bassaes. the Bassaes themselues
will not sticke sometimes to impart to our
Embassadours such matters, as are propounded among
them in their secrete and priuie Councell before
the great Turke himselfe: although he doth vse
verie oftentimes to call his Councell into the fielde,
taking occasion to go on hunting, to the end it shuld
not bee so easie for any particular persons to sound
the depth of his deliberations.Why the Bassaes disclose the Turkes secretes. But the Bassaes are
hereunto moued vpon diuerse and sundrie considerations:
sometimes vpon affection, as heretofore did
Mahomet Socoleuich the chiefe Visier of Selim, and



the Muphti of that time,What a Muphti. to the Agents of the state
of Venice.
            Muphti is the chiefest man among the Turkes in their
spirituall Superstitions, & the chiefe Interpreter of the law
of Mahomet, and is of so great authoritie in shew and apparance
that in matters of counsel his opinion is neuer contradicted
or gainsaid: I say in apparance, because when
the Turke is disposed to haue any matter goe forwarde in
deed, the Muphti either for flatterie, or for feare, is the
first and chiefest man to commend it.
            Sometimes the Bassaes are moued so to doe, for
that by quarrelling and iarring among themselues,
they thinke by these meanes the more easily to disturbe
the designements and purposes of their opposites,
as peraduenture the aforesayde Bassaes did,
and as Sinan and Ferat at last were wont to doe. Or
to be short, they are verie oftentimes moued thereunto,
because all Turkes generally are beyond all
measure greedie of bribes and gifts: as for example
among the Bassaes, that same Hassan shewed himself
to be,The cunning knauerie of Hassan Bassaes who was a Venetian of the Cilestri, and Generall
of the Sea before Cicala. For when one of the
Visiers had offered in Councell to the great Turke
that he would surprise the Citie of Venice, and was
not hearkened vnto, but rather reproued for his ridiculous
vanitie, hee went straight to the Venetian
Bailo, or Agent, and told him, that whereas such a
matter was propounded in the Councell by others,
he withstoode it, for the naturall affection which he
carried towardes that Common wealth: for the
which he receiued a most rich present. Lastly, it is
true also, that the Ottoman Counsellers do rewarde



their seruants, and enrich them by imparting their
secretes vnto them, to the ende that they may afterwards
acquaint such withall, as vse to bee most liberall
to them.The Ladie Sultanes. And so doe they likewise to their women:
whereupon it commeth to passe, that the Sultane
Ladies (who are either the Kins-folkes or the fauorites
of the great Turke, dwelling continually in
the Serraglioes, where al principall businesses are managed
and handled) become acquainted with these
secretes, which afterwardes for verie rich gifts and
presents that are sent to the said Ladies, from the officers
and Agents of such Princes as the secretes doe
concerne, by the Eunuches that wait vpon them
and keepe them, are verie easily disclosed and reuealed.
Moreouer they do sometimes indeuour with all
their studie and industrie, to performe some notable
seruice towards some Prince, to the end they might
receiue the oftner and richer Gratuities from him.
The mother of the now reigning Turke, pretendeth
to honour the state of Venice, and craueth of it verie
many times some reward for the same. It is not long
ago since all the Sultane Ladies requested of the sayd
state,Feathers made of Glasse. that it would forbid the carrying out of certain
feathers that are counterfeited and forged of glasse,
at Murano: which being ioyned and set togither, do
much resemble the plumes made of a Herōs fethers.
And this request they made, because the said counterfeit
or forged feathers, were sold so good cheape
at Constantinople, and yet did so please and satisfie the
people, that the said Sultane Ladies could not sell at
so high a rate, as before they did, the goodly bunches
and bundles of feathers of seuerall birds, which



were sent vnto them for Presentes, from diuerse
quarters in great quantities:The vse of wearing feathers, how and where it began. for it is the vse not
onely of men, but of women also, to weare such
feathers on their heades: following therein the
manner of the Tartarians, (from whome it came to
the Turkes:) for that Zingi Chan (who by some is
not rightly called Chan-gio,) was saued aliue by
the meanes of an Owle: for this Birde hauing alighted
vpon a certaine thicket of young trees, among
which Zingi had hidden himselfe, for feare of
his enemies that pursued him, they did verily thinke
that there could not be any body there, because the
Birde remayned there so quietly. Whereupon the
Tartarians (sayeth Haytho) do holde the sayde Birde
in great reuerence, so that hee, which at that time
could get any of her feathers, accounted himself a
happy man. And euer after, all the other Tartarians
from hand to hande haue still continually vsed to
weare the like feathers on their heades in memorie
of that action, and for a kinde of Reuerence.
         
         
            § XVI.
            BVt to returne to our discourse where wee left it:Amurath resolueth to make warre vpon the Emperour.
Amurath, after hee had floated and wauered
certaine dayes betweene the contrarieties of these
his Visiers Opinions, resolued with himself to moue
warre against the Emperour, hoping in this part of
the world also to surpasse the memorie of his predecessors,
as hee thought hee had done in Persia, and
so much the rather, for that hee was to make warre



in a Countrey adioyning to his owne, and consequently
very conuenient for Vittailes, and not inconuenient
for his Subiectes.Incouraged thereunto by Sinan Cicali. Hereunto hee was
also encouraged and heartened by Sinan Cicala, after
that hee perceyued hee had not perswaded the enterprise
of Corfu: hoping withall to obtayne the
Generalshippe, whereby hee might put downe his
Opposites, and purchase greate riches: especially
hauing authority, as indeede for the space of seauen
yeares hee had, to doo whatsoeuer the Great Turke
himselfe might haue done, if hee had beene present
in the Campe.By Hassan the Bassa of Bosna Moreouer Hassan the Bassa of Bosna,
a man rather temerarious and headdie, then valorous:
(if yee consider what he did in Croatia) continuallie
solicited Amurath to the same purpose:
both for the selfe same end, which is common to
all the Turkes, that is to say, to enrich himselfe by
the meanes of warre, and also because hee verilie
beleeued, that by this course he should safely attaine
and come to those supreme honours and dignities,
which were foretold him by the superstitious South
sayers. For beeing the Great Turkes chiefe Cutthrote
or Executioner, he was a most vaine obseruer
of such diuinations: Whereupon to satisfie Sinan
and himselfe, hee did continually aduertise and inform
the Turke of the losses and domages that were
wrought by the Vscocchi, and by the Subiects of the
Arch-duke, and of the burninges and spoiles that
they committed whiles they ouerranne the Countrey:
wherewith he did also assure him, that the best
course hee could take, was to beginne the warre
in those partes, and afterwardes pursue the same either



against the Emperour, or against the Venetians,
or else passing ouer on a sodaine into Italie (as was
done in the dayes of Mahomet, of Baiazet, and of
Soliman) to put all the princes of that Prouince into
an exceeding feare, and so to reape and bring home
most rich and wealthie spoyles. Yea he solicited him
so farre, that at the last hee obtained licence of the
Turke to begin the warre, by making himselfe to be
seene and knowne that hee was in the confines of
the Emperour: but yet with secret commission,
that he should not say he did it vpon his commaundement.
He erected the Fort of Petrina vpon the riuer
of Cupa,The fort of Petrina. which he called of himselfe Hassan Grad:
a place from whence he might easily runne ouer the
Countrey, and bridle Carlistod, Zagabria, Metlica, and
all the Countryes round thereabout: and spoyling
the villages euerie where, hee filled all places
with terrour, with teares, and with lamentations.
And one thing I will note by the way,A Parallele of two Bassaes. which is memorable,
and notable, Namely, that the first man also,
that ouer-ranne the Countrey in the confines of
Persia at the last warres, in token that the Turke had
broken the peace with him, was called euen by the
same name Hassan, being the Bassa of Van, which is
a Citie either of Medea, now called Seruan, and Vaaspracan,
or in the confines thereof, and was somtimes
the vttermost place that the Turkes had toward Persia:
and the same Hassan was none otherwise ouerthrowen
by the Persians, then as afterwardes it
happened to this Hassan, in fighting with the Emperialistes.
         
         
            
            § XVII.
            BVt because I haue oftentimes made mention of
the Vscocchi,What the Vscocchi be. it will not be farre from the purpose,
before I passe to other matter, briefly to tel you, who
they be, and so much the rather, because they were
the occasion of so great a warre. It is not true, that
those whom wee call Vscocchi, (which signifieth by
the Sclauoine worde Scoci, Skippers, or Leapers, because
they skip and leape like Goats, with their corded
shooes vpon the toppes of the Mountaines.) It
is not true (I say) that they are Inhabitants of Chimera,
as Iouius and others that follow his opinion do
beleeue. For the Vscocchi do dwell about fiue hundred
miles distant from the Chimeriottes (and yet they
are both people of Albania) in the Mountaines thatThe Vscocchi and the Chimeriotti not all one people.
are called Acro-ceraunii, in the mouth of the Gulfe,
right against the Cape of Santa Maria, the vttermost
Promontorie of all Italie. The Vscocchi speake the
Sclauoine speech, but the Chimeriottes the Albanian:
The one liue after the Romish rite, the other after
the Greeke. The one are a companie gathered togither,
and that but of a few, the other naturall by coūtry,
and many in number. Among the Vscocchi there
bee many Murlacchi, which cannot stay vnder the
Turke, and many that are banished by the state neer
to the Venetians and other Princes therabouts, and
fled to the Vscocchi for verie pouertie.What the Martelossi are. There are also
among them many Martelossi, that are Spies, and
theeues in those quarters: for so in deed signifieth
the worde Martelos, so that it is the name of a profession,



and not of a Nation,What the Murlacchi are. as some haue thought.
And because I haue also made mention of the Murlacchi,
I will not omit to tell you what they be. The
Murlacchi are called in those partes all the Christians
that dwel in the Mountaines, but specially those
that inhabit the mountaine Lica, which is betweene
Nouigrad and Segna. The originall of the Sclauoine
worde Moralacchi, was at the beginning, when the
Barbarians came into Italie, because after that they
had passed Walacchia, they called the peoples that
dwelled at the Adriatike Sea by that name, as if they
would say, Dwellers on the Sea. For euen as the
Turkes do call all the Italians by the generall word
Franchi, of the particular nation of the Frenchmen,
so did the Barbarians terme all Italians likewise by
that tearme of Vulacchi, or Vuloschi, as though they
were Walacchians.
            The Vscocchi doe dwell vpon the Sea at Segna,Where the Vscocchi do dwel and
Buccari, and within the land of Othozaz, and ouer all
Vinodol, which is a territorie belonging to the Conte
of Srim. And although they runne vp and downe
all those quarters, spoyling and robbing, and stealing
all that they can get, no otherwise then the Turcomanni
did in times past among the Grecians, yet are
they tollerated by the Imperiall Officers, because
they would not loose the deuotion and beneuolence
of that people, who without any expences or
charges of those estates, and with great brauerie defend
those Frontires, euen as the Cosacchi do in Polonia,Why they are tolerated by the Imperialists.
of whom I will speake more hereafter. But because
they are thus tollerated and also protected,
contrarie to the couenaunts and agreements that



haue passed betweene the Imperialistes and the
Turkes,The Turkes greeued with this tolleratiō. and also concerning the sea betweene the
Venetians and the Turkes, they haue oftentimes giuen
occasion to the Turkes to put handes to their
weapons, for the defence of their subiects and of
their marchādises, which they carry to Ancona, & to
Venice:The Venetians greeued at it also. yea & the Venecians thēselues haue bin occasioned
to do the like, as wel for the maintenāce of
the iurisdiction which they pretend to haue in the
Adriaticall sea, as also because they would take away
al occasions frō the Turks to come with an Armada,
for reuenge of the iniuries and losses, which they
haue receiued by thesaid Vscocchi: and finally, because
they would not bee troubled with the great
Turke, as alwayes they are, when his subiectes are
spoyled, by demaunding amendes for the same.
Moreouer, the Vscocchi haue within this little time
laid their hands to robbe the Christians also of their
marchandizes, and particularly the Venitians, not
(as their Vaiuodes and Arambassi do say) for the losses
which they receyued these last yeares, whiles
they were besieged in Segna, but in truth to enrich
themselues, by all the iniurious wayes and meanes
they could. Wherevnto they doe the more willingly
applie themselues, because they know verie well
that they cannot be hindred or at least verie hardly,
by the said Venetians, for that they come backed
and assisted by the Imperialistes, and can quickly
recouer their owne home, as in deede they doe
both safely and securely, and whensoeuer they list.
            These Vscocchi, may come forth into the Sea,
to pray and spoyle by foure wayes: that is to say,



betweene Fiume, Veghia, and Cherso:How many wayes the Vscocchi may come forth to the Sea. betweene
these Islandes and Arbe, betweene Arbe and Pago,
and betweene Pago, and the firme land of Zara. This
last passage hath somewhat a straite Channell, and
may bee of some 100. paces.
            The Venetians do keepe diuerse Gallyes, and
Barkes armed,How the Vscocchi may be hindered from their Theeuing. that walke continually vp and down
these Channels to hinder the Vscocchi, but by reason
of the many disorders, that haue hetherto hapened,
there are now but some Gallyes onely, or at least accompanied
with a fewe Barkes of small auaile. It
were verie necessarie, principally to multiplie the
number of Barks, which being backed behind with
Gallyes, might easily set vppon the Vscocchi: and
then without all doubt they might make the passage
for Marchantes to bee more safe and secure: and somuch
the better if there were appointed certaine
watches, euen in such places as were fittest for that
purpose. And although to doe this, the costes and
charges would be of some moment, yet they might
well bee borne, considering they shall bee vsed but
for a small time: for the Vscocchi being once seuered
and scattered, they cannot so easily vnite themselues
together againe: And the Marchants also no
doubte, would willingly contribute to the charges,
forasmuch as it concerneth their benefite and interest
principally. There might also a remedy be had
against their Theeueries in another sort, that is, by
contributing to the chiefe Captaines of the said Vscocchi,
a certaine summe of money competent, to the
end they should abstaine from doing any domage
by Sea, eyther to the Turkes or Christians. For to



hinder theeues from robbing, especialy such as these
bee, who are very couragious and hardie, is a thing
almost impossible, vnlesse it might bee performed in
deed by an open warre. And if any man should
thinke, that this course would displease the Turke,
for that hee could not but suspect that the Venetians
did not effectually employ themselues against the
Vscocchi, so long as their owne Marchants did passe
to and fro in safety: and forasmuch also, as this deliberation
and agreement could not be kept so secret,
but that it must needes come to the knowledge of
the Turkes: I doo thinke verily, that it may be prouided
for by one of these two meanes: eyther by
signifying so much to the great Turke himself whose
satisfaction is principally respected, or else by making
supplication to the Pope, that in regarde of the
publike quiet he would enterpose himselfe to cause
payment to bee made to the said chiefe Captaines,
with the monies of the state of Venice, or of the Marchantes,
to bee deliuered to his Holines secretlie.
Moreouer the Emperour himselfe might be treated
withall, that his Emperiall Maiesty would bee pleased
to accept of a conuenient Garrison for the defence
and custody of Segna, and of those Confines.
Or rather, which would be the true remedie indeed,
they might by generall consent and agreement bee
driued quite out of those Countryes, considering
that they are publike and common theeues, and authors
of the greatest troubles in Christendome: yea
and so much the rather, for that otherwise they can
neuer be diminished, much lesse vtterly extinguished,
aswell because they are not forbidden or hindered



from multiplying themselues, and receiuing
new supplies dayly into their troupes:A law among the Vscocchi. as also and
principally because they haue a law, that when the
husband dieth, the wife remaineth heire of all, and
he that afterwards taketh her to wife, becommeth
Lord and Maister of all that she possesseth.
            And hitherto let it be sufficient to haue spoken of
the Vscocchi, and of the meanes how to represse their
insolencies: wherein I referre my selfe, as also in all
other things which I haue heretofore sayd, and am
hereafter to say, to better iudgements then mine
owne, and to persons that are better informed then
I am.
         
         
            § XVIII.
            AMurath then hauing moued warre agaynst the
Emperour, Sigismundo Battori, the Prince of
Transiluania,Sigismundo Battori the Transiluanian declareth himselfe an open enemie to the Turke. shewed himselfe openly to be agaynst
the Turke a matter verily not expected by him, and
little hoped for by those that examined things onely
by reason, and according to state: for assuredly it
was the worke of the onely prouidence of God.
For by this open declaration of this prince, there is
arisen without all doubt, the securitie and safetie of
Germanie ond Italie, with the most notable diuersion
of the warre, that euer hath happened hitherto
against the proceedings of the Turks, by all the princes
Christian that haue fought with them.The offer of Sinan. Whereupon
Sinan hauing offered himselfe, after the death
of Hassan, to goe in person for the recouerie of that
which was lost, and to restraine the tongues of such



as did sting and backbite him to his grand Seignieur
as being the Authour of this councell, and being
gone forth in deed with supreeme and soueraigne
authoritie, there happened betweene the one side
and the other, all those actions, which shall be particularly
written by the Historiographers.
            And behold,The death of Amurath and his sepulchre. whiles this Sinan was at Belgrado,
the Emperour Amurath died the 9. day of Ianuarie
in the yeare 1595. and was buried at Constantinople,
in a Meschita, or Meszita, which he had made in his
life time,Why the Turks temples are  Moschee. and dedicated to Bahalzebuf, that is to say,
to the Idole of Flies: for thereupon peraduenture
such fabrikes or buildings are either corruptly or in
mockage called by vs Christians Moschee, of Moscha
which signifieth a Flie. Prince Mahamet being returned
frō Magnesia to Constantinople, after the death of
his father,Mahamet succeedeth. by the great carefulnes of Ferat, who presently
dispatched a Gally vnto him, and being inthronized
according to the accustomed Ceremonies
of the Ottomans, the deliberations and consultations
touching the war, were renued. It was thought
at the first, that Mahamet was rather inclined to peace
then otherwise, hauing found (as it was noted vnto
you in the beginning of this discourse) the Citie full
of dearth, his subiects not well pleased with this
warre,The pretence of Sinan to be chiefe Visier. the Bassaes diuided among themselues, and
specially the two chiefest of them, Sinan and Ferat:
for the one chalenged the chiefe place, because hee
was alwayes most louing towardes him, and had disswaded
his father from a certain determination that
sometimes he had to put him to death, for iealousie
of the state, and had euer aduertised him from time



to time, whatsoeuer had happened in the Empire
The other thought that he had purchased great merite,The pretence of Ferat to be chiefe vtsier.
because he had in so short a time brought him
into the possessiō of his Empire, that he had so greatly
desired, and that at such a time, as was most important
for the estate of all his affaires. In such sort,The death of them both.
as for these causes, and for others also which I haue
told you before, they iustled lustily one agaynst the
other till in the end they were both brought to
their deathes.
            Notwithstanding Mahamet,The reasons that moued Mahamet to go forth to the warre in person. after that hee had
somwhat setled his houshold & domestical affaires,
was of necessitie constrained to go forth to the war
in his owne person: and principally besides the reasons
before alledhed, because the Souldiers did not
sticke openly to giue him to vnderstand, that to the
camp they would go no more without the presence
of their great Lord: for that they were greatly discontented
with the former Generals, Sinan and Ferat,
who had intreated them verie hardly. Besides
that the seedes of ciuill discords, did as yet remaine
aliue, in those that were affectionate, some to one of
them, and some to the other: And lastly because
Cicala had promised him assured victorie, if hee
would so doe.
         
         
            § XIX.
            IN this yeare, which was the first yeare of his going
foorth,The taking of Agria and the importance thereof. hee surprised Agria: a place which although
it bee not verie strong in regard of the hill,
that commandeth it, yet is it of great inportance for



the situation, because the vniting of the Transiluanians
forces with the Emperours will be now more
difficult, for that the Turkes will continually haunt
and beate the way that leadeth from Toccai to Cassouia:
for the other vpper way of Sacmar, is much
longer. And it is so much of greater importance, because
if the walles of Agria bee repaired, the Turke
may there maintaine a puissaunt armie, betweene
both his enemies.
         
         
            § XX.
            IN this yeare also happened the battaile,A doubtfull battaile. whereof
without doubt it may be said, that either both the
armies remained victorious, the Imperiall in the beginning,
and the Ottoman in the end: or else that neither
of them was vanquished by the other, seeing
both of them retired vncertain of their owne estates
or how the matter had gone with them. And so do
we read, that it happened euen alike in the battaile
betweene Lewes the xi king of Fraunce,Lewes the 11. Charles duke of Burgundie. and Charles
Duke of Burgoine: to leaue the examples of the
Greekes and Romaines, that are more auncient.
Whereupon it was, that both the armies following
the aduise and counsaile of Leo the Emperour, did
rather giue encouragement to their seueral peoples,
with signes of apparant ioy on both sides, then confesse
their losses.The flight of Mahamet. True it is in deed, that Mahamet
saw with his owne eyes, that at the beginning his armie
was so discomfited and confounded, as greatly
fearing his life, he fled to a hill in the sight of Agria,
accompanied with some few of his Agalaries, and



there dryed and wiped his eyes with a peece of Mahomets
apparrell,Hee dryed his eyes with a peece Mahamets vesture. which for reuerence hee carried about
him. Trne it is that our Men had shewed very
great valour: for lesse then 50. thousand Souldiers▪
(so many iumpe, as Francisco Maria, Duke
of Vrbino required, for the extirpation and rooting
out of that tyranny,) went to meete with the enemie,
fought with him, and discomfited an Armie
of 300. thousand persons, euen in the presence and
viewe of their Prince, who had gathered the same
together, almost out of all the Forces of his Empire.
Insomuch as it cannot any way bee doubtted,
but that if our men had been lesse greedy, more
vnited, better aduised and instructed, and aboue all
if they had beene the friends of the Lord of Hostes,
they had obtayned one of the most singular victories,
that peraduenture was euer obtained by the
Cbristians, yea and had taken Mahamet prisoner,
as Baiazet the first was at Mount Stella, by the Greate
Tamur Chan, that is to say, an Iron Lorde, who is
otherwise by some corruptly called Tamerlan and
Tamburlan.Tamerlan. In briefe, to conclude this parte, the
Turkish Captaines hauing shewed small knowledge
and little valour, and therefore many of them were
degraded and put to death, and almost all the common
Souldiers hauing likewise shewed great cowardize
and astonishment of mind: it is very likelie
that their Great Lord and Maister will thinke better
of his businesse in the yeare to come, eyther by
making peace, or by continuing the warre with
lesse daunger. Whereupon, whiles Christendom
attendeth and waiteth in great perplexitie of her



doubtfull cogitations, peraducnture it shall not be
vnprofitable, if (asmuch as shal lie in me) I go about
a little further to search out the thoughts and counsels
of our enemies, and examine what may or
ought to bee done by our Princes Christian to aduance
their businesses, to the glory of God and man.
            The end of the Second Part.
         
      
      
         The third part.
         Wherein is treated, That suppose the Turke will growe to
Peace, whether it bee good that the Emperour and
the Transyluanian make peace with him: with a
discourse of such matters, as if the warre continue,
the said Princes may worke against him: & what
the other Christian Princes may also doe, to meet at
all times, with such daungers as may alight vppon
Christendome by the Ottoman Forces,
         IN this last Part then, I will shewe
first, That let it be supposed, Mahamet
the Emperour of the
Turkes, hath a desire to grow to
a Peace with the Christian Emperour,
and with the Transyluanian,



whether it be good that those Princes should
make peace with him: and secondly I will discourse
vpon such matters as the great Turke feareth, if the
warre bee continued, may bee wrought against
him, as wel by the said Princes, as by the other Princes
of Christendome. Wherewith I will also endeuour
my selfe to giue you such notice and knowledge
of peoples and places, as peraduenture this
my trauaile shall bee deemed altogether vnprofitable.
         
            § I.
            EVen from the verie beginning of this warre,Aduice giuen to Mahamet to make peace with the Emperour. Amurath
refused to treate of peace, whereunto he
was greatly solicited by the Embassadors of France,
and England: to the ende they might haue procured
him to make warre by Sea, (as before I noted)
against the king of Spaine, of purpose to diuert him
from the warre, which the said king continued against
their Princes. Their instant motions they reinforced
againe after the two ouerthrowes giuen
to the two Hassans, the one in Croatia, and the other
in Hungarie: and a while after that, the stirres and
tumults of almost an open rebellion that were perceiued
in Constantinople, which after the death of
Amurath, were much more renued in Mahamets
time. They did also most manifestly set before his
eyes the difficulties of this present warre, & brought
him to a consideration how much more easily the
other might be effected. Moreouer, they considered
also the open declaration, that the prince of Transiluania



had made, whereby without all doubt the
difficulties of the warre might grow greater to the
Turks: for that the said Prince being a yong man &
valiant, and hauing gained a verie great reputation
among diuerse peoples and nations, as well friends,
as enemies, he would neuer be drawen backe by any
other meanes, but only by necessitie: wherunto it
would be the hardest matter in the world to driue
him, as long as there was no peace made with the
Emperor, which peace could not by all likelihoods
be hoped for at that time, considering the common
interestes of both the said Princes, the new confederacie
concluded betwixt them by their late alliance,
the insurrection of the Racians (of whom I will
speake in their due place) the rebellions of the Vniuodes
of Moldauia and Walacchia, and lastly the feare
which all the Turkes had, least the Transiluanian
should be the man, that was to bring low,The Turkes feare the Transiluanian. or peraduenture
quite to ouerthrow the vnmeasurable hugenesse
of the Turkish Empire. Insomuch as Mahamet
giuing eare to the foresaid reasons, & fearing aboue
all thinges to prouoke and raise against himselfe a
league and confederacie of the Christian Princes, (a
matter greatly feared of all the Ottoman Princes) it
seemed as well by the answere which hee caused to
be giuen to the said Agents, as also by that which he
went about to worke,Mahamet cōtented that peace betreaed of. that hee had a minde not altogither
alienated or estraunged from peace, and so
much the rather, for that he permitted the Beglerbey
of Grecia to negociate and treate with the Agents
of the Emperour, of the Transiluanian, and of the
Walacchian.
         
         
            
            § II.
            HOwbeit, the truer opinion was, that this Mahamet
was encouraged to warre,Mahamet resolued to continue warre. The presage of Ferdinando. Why the Turkes negotiate peace. yea neuer a
whitlesse then his father Amurath was, especially after
the ouerthrow which he receiued in Croatia, to
recouer the reputation that hee had lost: for so was
it the opinion of the olde Archduke Ferdinando,
that it would come to passe. But in deede it was
thought, that he rather negotiated the peace (besids
those reasons that are aboue specified) as well to follow
the vse of all warres, and specially of the Ottomans,
as also by that meanes to make vs Christians,
the more negligent and carelesse in our resolutions
and preparations: hoping aboue all other things,
that we while peace was intreating, would walke
more fearefully and warily in annoying him, least
we should thereby prouoke him further: Euen as
it fell out (iust) to the Emperour Maximilian the second,Why Maximilian the 2. did not surprise Alba-Regale, when he might.
who for none other respect forbare to surprise
and reduce to his subiection Alba-Regale, but onely
because he would not anger Soliman, with whom he
was then in treatie of peace: which although it was
indeed concluded, yet was it afterwards broken with
the great losse of the said Emperour.
            But let vs suppose, that Mahamet either desired at
that time to make peace in good earnest, or at least
desireth it now at this time,Points of consideration. it is fit and conuenient
to consider verie well, whether in regard of the present
state of our affaires, we on our behalfes ought to
make peace with him, I will report the principall



points, whereupon in mine opinion this whole businesse,
and the resolution of so important a matter
dependeth. Of which poynts some doe belong to
the Emperour, and to the Transiluanian, and some
others to the honour and interest of all Christendome:
leauing the same notwithstanding to the
iudgement of other men.
         
         
            § III.
            THE first thing to be considered is,Conditions of peace, which the Turke will looke for. that we may
probably beleeue the Turke will neuer make
peace, vnlesse on the one side the Emperour, and the
Transiluanian doe make restitution vnto him of all
his places which they haue surprised: and on the
other side, he must remaine free and vnbound from
making any restitution, especially of any thing that
is of moment.A law of the Turkes not to restore any thing once gotten. For the Turkes holde it for an inuiolable
law, that the ground which is once troden
with the feet of their horses, & takē into possession,
ought neuer to be restored: & specially if they haue
built any Meschites, or Temples therein, or else
when the places which they haue gotten, be conuenient
for them, and for their aduauntage. And although
we do read that Amurath the second▪ after he
had spoyled and depriued the Despote, George Wocouiche
of Seruia, yet hee restored him to his estate
which he had lost:
                  eogie Wocouich Dispote of Seruia, father in law to Amurath the second. yet ye must vnderstand that Amurath
did so, because hee was desirous to make
peace with the Hungarians, whose valour hee greatly
feared. Besides that he was also his father in law,
because he had a daughter of his to his wife, althogh



shee were of the Greeke Religion. One of those
sinnes, for which it hath pleased God to spoile and
depriue many Rulers of those Countries,George Wocouich tearmed an Infidell because he maied his daughter to the Turke. Cephalonia recouered by the Venetians. euen of
their States and Liberties, as it happened to the said
George himselfe, after the last ouerthrow of Laodislaus:
whereupon in their Sclauoyne songes, hee is
to this day called Heuiernish, that is to say an Infidel.
True it is also, that Cephalonia the Island, belonging
sometimes to the Turke, is now in the possession of
the State of Venice, after it was conquered by the
helpe of Consaluo di Cordua, called the Grand Captaine,
eyther because the Turke thinketh it is a matter
of no moment,Selim restored diuerse places to Giacomo Soranzo, for the behoofe of Venice. or els that it is not very easie to be
recouered. So Selim in the last peace that he made
with Venice, was contented that there should be restored
to Giacomo Soranzo Commissioner for that
State, by Ferat Bey, (he that of late yeares dyed Bassa
of Buda,) thirteene villages that were by the bordering
Turkes, surprised in that warre, in the territorie
of Zara: foureteene more in the territory of
Sebenico, and somewhat also in the territorie of Spalato:
For by that meane hee thought he should bee
the better assured of the breach and dissoluing of
that League, whereof at the last hee was greatlie afrayed.
            The Restitution, which wee may feare, that
Mahamet looketh to haue from the Emperour will
be in Croatia, of the contentious Fort of Petrina,What restitution Mahamet looketh for of the Emperour and
of all that which hee hath surprised vpon the way of
Canisa, beyond the riuer Draua, euen as farre as Baboz,
which is neare vnto Zighet his Frontier. In
the lower Hungarie hee looketh for the restitution



of Strigonia, and Vicegrado: and in vpper Hungarie
of Vaccia, Filec and Nouigrad. And it may be moreouer,
that hee will challenge the repayring of the
burnt walles of Attuan, or some encrease of Tribute,
(as hee calleth it,) for his expenses in the
warre.
            Of the Prince of Transyluania,What restitution hee looketh for from the Transyluanian. hee will challenge
the restitutition of Walacchia, and require that hee
deuest and depriue himselfe of all pretenses and tytles,
which hee sayeth hee hath thereunto. Moreouer
that hee restore vnto him Lippa, which is of
great importance to Transyluania, because it is in his
confines, and within the Bassanate of Temesuar vpon
the riuer Marisso: And finally, that the Sangiacke-shippes
of Ianoua and Bezcherech with diuers other
places of lesse name which hee had burned may be
repayred, or els that hee may be well payed for thē:
besides some other giftes and yearely augmentations,
which he looketh for.What places the Turke for his part wil neuer restore.
            
            On the other side, yee may almost be assured
that there will neuer bee gotten of Mahamet the
Countrey of Tureuopolie, which is betweene Saua and
Cupa,What a Bano is. now vnder the iurisdiction of the Bano: Bani
are certaine Gouernors of Prouinces, but are of lesse authoritie
then the Beglerbyes, though some haue written otherwise.
Neither shall ye euer get of him Biz, or Bicagi,
a place of some importance, because it is more towardes
the Sea coast, neare to the territorie of the
Venetians to come to Nouigrad: nor in Hungarie on
this side of the Danowe, Vesprino, and Giauarino, with
the Castles neare adioyning, and beyond the Danow
Agria, the last place that he hath taken.
            

               
I haue thought good to set downe the said places
by their particular names, to the ende that by
knowing what matters of greatest moment and importance
are in the possession of either side, my narration
and discourse may proue the plainer.
         
         
            § IIII.
            THE second thing to be considered is this:what danger if both Emperour and Transiluaman do not ioyne togither to make peace with the Turk if the
Turke refuse to make peace ioyntly with the
Emperour and the Transiluanian togither, whether
these Princes ought to agree to a peace the one without
the other. Certaine it is, that to doe it seuerally
and disioyned, would bee to the great daunger of
him that is the weaker, or of him that is excluded
out of the peace, and also it would bee agaynst the
confederacie, against the couenants and conditions
wherunto they haue sworne, and against the promises,
which they haue both made to the Pope. Moreouer,
who can doubt but that it would also bee against
all law and dutie of gratitude on the Emperours
behalfe,Ingratitude in the Emperor▪ in regarde of the singular benefite,
which hee hath receyued by this open declaration
that the Transiluanian hath made against the Turke?
and on the Transiluanians part,Breach of faith in the Transiluanian. would it not bee agaynst
the obseruation and keeping of his worde,
which he professeth to be inuiolable, and quite contrarie
to that which he hath hitherto refused to doe,
although he hath beene therunto required, both by
the last, and also by this now present Emperour of
the Turkes, with most ample and large conditions
of benefite, of hononrable tytles, and of perpetuall



protection? Which if the Emperour Ferdinand
had regarded, most certaine it is, that little lesse then
all Hungarie had beene at this day in the possession
of our enemes.
            Moreouer,No faith in Infidels▪ who can euer promise to himselfe any
faith in an Infidell, without feare, that he will not
breake the bonds of all lawfull peace at his pleasure?
considering that princes, & specially the barbarous
Princes neuer wanted plausible and likely pretenses
so to do as the Venetians do know verie well by the
faith and promise, that Selim did breake with them,
in the yeare 1570. besides almost an infinite number
of examples, that might be alledged thereof. Which
point of breach of faith, although in truth no prince
can in reason feare, yet certaine it is,The Transiluanian is to feare breach of faith in the Turke. that the Transiluanian
Prince hath an exceeding great cause to
feare it, because the Ottoman house thinketh, that
from him onely it hath receiued all the iniuries
and al the losses of this present warre, and that by his
onely Rebellion (for so doe the Turkes call this his
iust and lawfull desire, which he hath to withdraw
himselfe from the Turkish soueraigntie) all their designements
and complots haue beene interrupted
and frustrated, and the course of their hoped victories
vtterly stopped: and so much the rather ought
he to feare it, for that if the whole tide and force of
the warre should come vpō him alone, hardly could
he defend himselfe from so mightie an enemie, if
he should not be ayded and succoured, neither by
the Polacke, nor by the Emperour: for of himselfe
alone he is but a poore and a weake Prince. And although
it may seeme, that he hath a state fortified by



nature, and therefore might peraduenture be defended
for some time, yet in the ende he should of necessitie
be constrained, either willingly or by force
to yeeld to that power, which is now growne to be
so terrible and fearefull to the whole worlde both
for number of people, and also for treasure, and in respect
of all maner of furniture for warre, almost inuincible.
            Neither should the Emperour be free from feare
in this point,The  
                  eare the same if the Transiluanian should be at peace
with the Turke: because it would be inough for the
Ottoman Emperour onely to haue these princes disarmed
for a time. For hee knoweth verie well with
how great difficulty Souldiers are brought togither
againe vnder their ensignes, after that they are once
returned home: and especially how hard it is for the
Emperour, who is constrained to make warre rather
with auxiliarie Souldiers, then with his owne, who
also cannot come to succour him without some
time, and the meeting togither of circuites and
dietes, which are to be holden, before any thing can
be done.
            And thus vpon these reasons that haue beene set
downe, it may be concluded verie resolutely, that to
make peace on this fashion, would not onely not be
helpefull to the two Princes, but also much more
daungerous and pernicious to both their estates, for
that the enemie may shortly after take vp armes againe,
and renue the warre with greater aduauntage,
whensoeuer hee shall thinke it fit and conuenient
for him.
         
         
            
            § V.
            THE third and last consideration, which appertaineth
not so much to the aforsaide Princes,Where it is likely the Turk will bend his forces next. but
to all Christendome togither, is, that suppose the
Turk do make peace, and keepe it for a while, where
may we thinke in reason, that hee will hereafter direct
his arrowes? For we haue established this for
a most certaine ground and foundation, that the
Ottoman Empire doth keepe her Subiects alwayes
occupied and emploied in new warres, against some
state or other, as hauing had her originall and maintenance
by force and armes.
            Of truth it is not to be thought, that he will renue
the warre against the King of Persia,Not against the king of Persia. at the least as
yet, and not being prouoked thereunto: because
the Souldiers of Europe, who are the sinewes and
strength of his Armies, doe abhorre to go thither, by
reason of the length of the iourney, the want of vittailes,
the roughnesse of the wayes, and the braue
valour of the Persians. And so much the lesse is it
likely that he will renue the warre there, because it
is but a while agoe since hee made peace with that
king, and for that he hath not as yet fullie established
the foundations of his new Fortresses. And to bee
briefe, the Persian indeed wanteth no Souldiers
for there are three sortes of Souldiers that goe
to warre vnder him: The Turcomanni, who are
vnto him as Feudataries be with vs, and hold their
landes of him. The Corizzi, or Coridschi, who are stipendaries
and waged by him: and Auxiliaries, who
are such as come to ayd and succour him, and namely,



the Armenians, the Georgians, and others all verie
valiant and hardie, especially those that goe to
warre on horsebacke, as all of them for the most part
doe, which is the greatest imperfection in the Persian
Armies.
         
         
            § VI.
            NEither is it to bee thought,Nor against the king of Fez and Marocco. that hee will moue
warre in Africa, against Mulei Ameth the king
of Fez and Marocco,The Siriffo of Africa. whome the Moores call the
Siriffo, which signifyeth as much with the Turkes,
as the title of Sultan, vz. King and Lorde. For in
so doing, hee shall get but little, and much hee may
loose, besides that, hee shall be somewhat too farre
from home. Moreouer Mulei Ameth, who was the
Brother of Abdala and of Mahamet, is a man very
hardy and warlike: insomuch as although to diuert
the suspition, which his Brother Abdala had
conceiued against him, whiles he raigned, and was
King, hee shewed himselfe euen for all the worlde
as the Ottoman Mahamet did, to auoide the wrath
and displeasure of his Father, altogether geuen to
pleasures and sensualitie,The kingdom of Gago. The finest gold. yet did hee afterwardes
conquere the Kingdome of Gago, towardes Guiney:
from whence there is brought the most fine & pure
gold xxiiii. Caractes: and holdeth in possession al
that parte of the Countrey, which is more then a
hundred dayes iourney from the Ocean sea, euen
aboue Tripoli.
         
         
            
            § VII.
            NOr against the Isle of Malta, because (as Amurath
was aduised by Sinan Cicala,Nor against the Isle of Malta. whilest he
was Generall of the Sea) it would turne to the smal
credite and reputation of the Ottoman Empire, to
imploy so huge Forces against so small an Island, &
so much the rather, because it might peraduenture
fall out, that hee should neuer obtaine the possession
thereof, or at least it would bee verie hard to get
it, aswell in regard that it is now much better fortified
and strengthned then it was in the dayes of Soliman:
as also because it would bee very couragiously
defended by the auncient brauery of those
most valiant knightes, and sooner relieued and succoured
by the Christian Princes, who are now
well taught and instructed thereto by their former
experience.
         
         
            § VIII.
            NOr yet against Spaine,Nor against Spaine Insurrection of the Morescoes. vpon a vaine hope, that
the Moores which are there, woulde make
an insurrection and rebell against the King: For
it is not true (as some thinke) that they are so readie
to put in execution, as indeed they are all confederated
to desire innouation, yea so much the lesse may
the Turke hope for any such insurrection, for that
the said Morescoes are diuided in many seuerall
places, which places are also verie open and without
strength: they are also vnarmed, and a people



of no certaine faith: and therefore in such a case they
will not be ouer-hastie, and specially for feare of loosing
their wealth and riches.Portingals & Arrogonians.
            
            As concerning the Portugals and the Aragonians,
of whom also according to the opinion of the
Bassaes, it seemed that the King Catholike might
stand in some feare: the truth is, that they are not
onely humbled by a tollerable kinde of inforcement,
but euen of their owne selues they haue applied
and setled their mindes to an honest necessitie.
Moreouer, those that haue good intelligence in
matters of state, doe knowefull well, that to lend the
eare to the aduices and encouragement of Outlawes
and discontented persons, is a verie vaine
thing, and oftentimes proueth verie daungerous.
            Besides it is verie likely and credible, that the
Turke will verie well bethinke himselfe, before hee
will rashly run to prouoke and stirre vp the greatest
king in the world against him, notwithstanding
that hee bee greatly busied and occupied in other
wars: as wel for that if he should be molested by the
Ottoman forces, he may very easily cōclude a peace,
or at least suspension from warres with his enemies,
as also because he is so mightie a Prince, that he may
wel quite himselfe against the Turks, especially with
his Armada, and Fleete of ships, which without encrease
of any expences vnto him, he may cause euerie
yeare in good time to scoure the Ottoman Seas.
For out of all doubt, he is not inferiour to the Turk,The Turkes Empire.
neither in forces, nor in greatnesse of Empire. Considering
that the Turkish Empire (if notwithstanding
it be lawfull to call that state an Empire, which



is vnduly vsurped and kept from the lawfull Emperours)
is in deede verie huge and great, for that in
Asia it possesseth all that is betweene the greater Sea,In Asia.
and the Ocean of Arabia and Persia: and from
the Caspian Sea, and the riuer Araxis, and the other
more Easterly confines of the Kingdome of Persia,
euen vntill the Mediterraneall Coastes of the Hellespont
as farre as Nilus. And in Africa,In Africa. all the coast of
Nilus, till ye come beyond Algieri, and also a great
part within the land of this prouince, where it bordereth
vpon Egypt,In Europe. and the red Sea. And in Europe,
all that Countrey which is from Buda euen to Canstantinople,
and betweene the riuer Niestro, and the
Danow, and the AEgean Sea,In Islands. and the Adriatike, with
all the coast of the greater Sea, as farre as Tana. Besides
all the Islandes of Asia, and the greatest part of
the Islands of Greece. And yet notwithstanding, the
Empire of the most potent king of Spain is nothing
inferiour vnto it,The Empire of the King of Spaine. for it stretcheth her power and iurisdiction
in the West, it inlargeth the confines of
her most mightie estate in the East, and passing ouer
the new world, and arriuing euen to the Islands
of the Moluccaes, the vttermost part of the Orientall
Islands it reacheth (like a true Monarchie indeede)
ouer all those maritimall or Sea-parts as farre as the
straite of Gibraltar.
            Neither truly is it likely (as some thinke) that he will
moue warre against the Polackes, or against the Tartarians,
or against the Moscouites.
         
         
            § IX.
            NOt against the Polackes,Nor against Polonia. because they are (as a
man may say) in the verie bowels of the Turkish



estate. They are verie wel armed both with men and
horse: and if they doe possesse Moldauia, and Walacchia
(as easily they may doe) and then passe ouer the
Danow into Bulgaria, they may fortifie the banks of
Danow as the Romans did, and hardily pierce with
their Armes, euen into Constanstinople, which is the
verie heart of his Empire, and so vtterly ruinate and
destroy all his Country, with the same brauerie and
valour which the Polackes haue sundry times shewed
when they warred with the Turkes.
         
         
            § X.
            NOt against the Tartarians,Nor against Tartaria. because they are of
the selfe same Religion with him, and also his
confederates: with whom if he should warre, hee
should gaine either little or nothing of them, because
they are but poore, and for the most liue abroad
in the fieldes, so that whensoeuer they shall
perceiue the approach of their enemie, they may easily
retire themselues, and when the enemy is departed,
recouer that which was lost. And finally, if the
Turke shall keepe and maintaine them as his friends,
he may reape many and great seruices at their hands,
whereas on the contrarie, if hee hold them his enimies,
they may worke him much harme.
         
         
            § XI.
            AND lastly, not against the Moscouites,Nor yet against Moscouit. because
they dwell among frozen Ices, and fennie
Marrishes, in a barren Countrey, farre distant and



diuided from all his estates: whose Prince is continually
enuironed and garded with a great number
of Horsemen and Footemen, who are also very
well trained and exercised in managing and handling
the Arcubuse.
            If then it be a matter in reason not to be feared,But either against Venice or against all Italie. that
though he should conclude a peace, he would moue warre against
any of these aboue mentioned, yet of a certaintie we
may greatly feare, that he will resolue to bend his forces,
either against the state of Venice, or against all Italie.
         
         
            § XII.
            IF against the state of Venice:If against Venice: thē what trouble to Christendome in verie truth, the
troubles of Christendome, would then be greater
then now they are, because the nearer the daunger
would thereby be vnto Italie, and vnto the verie
state of Religion, so much the more considerable
and troublesom would it be. The Princes of Greece
because they did not succour the princes that were
their next neighbours,By example of Grecia. who were exposed and open
to the Ottoman forces, all of them wholy lost their
estates: God himselfe in the meane while permitting
the same to be effected, not onely for their riot
and voluptuousnesse, and for the ciuill discords that
were among them, but also yea and much more for
the Schisme, which the Greekes had made in the
holy Church, so that first by the Gotthes, then by
the Bulgarians, afterwardes by the Sarracens, and
last of all by the Turkes, they were brought to that
lamentable miserie wherein now they are: euen as
Pope Nicholas the fift foretold, when he writ to the



Emperour Constantine, surnamed the Dragon, as
Gennadius the Patriarke of Constantinople hath obserued,
and I in another place haue touched more at
large. Cardinall Bessarion writing to the Princes
of Italie, sayeth,And of Constantinople. that because they would not in
time relieue Constantinople, onely with 50. thousand
Crownes, they were the cause and chiefe occasion,
why the Turkes afterwardes, hauing gotten possession
thereof, with a continuall course of perpetuall
victories, subdued Trabisonda, Sinope, the Islande
of Metelino, (i. Mitylene,) La Morea, Caramania,
and the Countries adioyning, Bossina, Bulgaria, the
Lower Hungarie, Epirus, and a great part of Dalmatia,
of Albania, and of Sclauonia, and lastly of the
Island of Negroponte.
            But forasmuch as the worlde ringeth to this
day with the wordes,Pope Vrbanes exhortation to moue christendome to the recouery of Ierusalem. which the Great Pope Vrban
vttered, when in Cleremount of Aluernia, he
mooued and encouraged the Christian Princes to
the glorious conquest of Ierusalem, which is called
euen by the Turkes Cuzzimu Barec, that is
to say, The famous and holy place, for the reuerence
which they beare to the Sepulchre of our Lord, &
in that respect is visited (as Bethlehem likewise is,)
by their Chazilarii, that is to say, their Pilgrimes,
in their returne from Mecha: And forasmuch also,
as euery man dooth well know the godly and
wonderfull entreatie and perswasion made to the
saide Christian Princes, by Petrus Heremita,Petrus Hermita. and
the Sermons of the blessed Fryer Iohn Capestrano,Iohn Capestrano.
who had already gathered together 40. thousande
signed and marked with the Crosse, to goe against



the Turkes, euen in the very selfe same countryes
where now the warre is: And lastly, forasmuch as
besides the holy and very zealous exhortations of
many Popes, and other holy Men, (whereof there
is great store to bee founde in the Councels, and
ecclesiastical Hystories) there resoundeth now in
our time ouer all Christendome,Pope Clement the eight. the liuely voyce of
the now liuing Pope Clement, who like another
Iacob, watching day and night, without any tyring
or wearinesse, for the seruice and maintenance of
Labans sheepe, that is to say, of the faithfull flocke
of Iesus Christ, cryeth out with a loude voyce, by
his holie prayers and deuoute teares to the Lord for
mercie towardes our saluation and safegard: It shal
bee sufficient at this present, briefly to recount the
substance of those matters, which pope Pius the second,
(euen the same that wrote a long letter to
Mahamet the second Emperour of the Turkes to conuert
him vnto the Catholike Faith) being full of
the holy Ghost, vttered at the Councell of Mantua,
in presence of the Christian Princes, after hee
had bewayled the ruine of the Greeke Empire, and
of other kingdomes in Christendome, that were
fallen into the Turkes power, vz.
            Surely,The substance of the speech of Pius the second in the Councell of Mantua. it would bee a verie righteous aud religious
matter, O yee most generous and Noble Princes of Christendome,
if once at the last yee would waken your selues, &
enter into an earnest cogitation, not to suffer those poore &
dismayed reliques of Christians, vtterlie to bee lost, that
are forgone into the most cruell rage of the Barbarians,
which of you, in good sooth doeth not clearely and manifestly
see the common and imminent daunger, that hangeth



ouer our heades? Andrinopolis, and Nicopolis,
(because I will not at this time remember so many other
most goodly and rich Countries, which most vniustly that
most cruell and outragious Tyrant doth now possesse) were
of no long time heretofore, Cities further distant, then were
those Christians that haue beene lately taken, and are now
most cruelly and miserably tormented by our enemies. Oh
that you might bee moued, yee religious and godly Princes,
with the incomparable bond and obligation, wherein yee
are bound to Christ our Lord, who hath not onely freed and
deliuered you from the iawes of the auncient Serpent, but
also hath appointed you to be Princes of his people, to the end
that like watchfull and charitable Pastors ye should couragiously
keepe the same from the mouth of the Wolfe. The
blessed God hath put into your handes the Scepter, and the
sworde, because it should bee your care, as well by doing iustice,
and shewing mercie to maintaine his people in peace,
as also by warre to deliuer those that are vnduly and vniustly
oppressed. Let your perticular interestes cease, when
the Interestes of God commeth in place. Let the discourses
of mans wit giue place to the cause of God. Nay rather,
euen your owne peculiar and proper interestes, and humane
respects also do perswade you of themselues to take weapons
into your hands, and to represse and daunt the pride of this
most cruell and fierce wilde beast, who like a Lion raungeth
about continually, ouer all the Champeine and field of Christendome
greedily to deuoure some part either of our owne
Countries or of our neighbours. Alas, let vs learne by other
mens expences and losses. Let vs quench the fire of our
brethren, least we burne vp our selues also with them: Let
vs in time meete with this great tide, that like a headlong
streame is like shortly to surround all our Countreys. Vp ye



generous & noble champions of Christ, resolue couragiously
with your selues (to the end that our age be not thought to be
lesse glorious then former times) in some sort to imitate &
follow Godfrey, Baldwyn, Boemound, and those other
famous Argonautes, who to recouer out of the prophane
handes of the enemies of holy fayth, the sacred Sepulchre of
our Redeemer, sold their owne proper goodes, abandoned
their landes and houses, passed ouer the Seas, and for a long
time endured exceeding great trauailes and troubles, because
they thought that they could not better employ their
treasures, ther weapons, and their valour, then in so holy
and laudable an enterprise, who then will bee the first man
that will take the Crosse, and giue example to others? Who
will he be, that will be Captaine and guide herein? Where
be the Souldiers of Christ, that will follow this glorious
standard and Ensinge? And finally who will shew himselfe
so impious, that he will not lay aside all priuate iniuries
and hatreds, for the common safetie?
            But hereof let it be inough for me to haue spoken, being
carried therunto out of my determinate discourse and narration,
by a iust zeale that I beare towardes the honour of
God, and the saluation of so many soules, which are redeemed
by the bloud of Christ, and liue at this day in the
most miserable thraldome and slauerie of the Ottoman
Empire.
            And therefore if the great Turke shoulde
mooue warre agaynst the Common-wealth of
Venice:Why Venice should bee relieued. (which God forbid, because the saide
estate of the Venetians doth deserue to bee kept
and preserued a perpetuall Virgin through all
ages, as well for the comfort of her subiects, for the
ornament of the worlde, and for the defence of



Christendome, as also for the pietie thereof, and for
the excellent manner of gouernment therein vsed)
the daunger would be of great importaunce, and it
would then bee verie necessarie (if the loue of my
Countrie doe not deceiue mee:) that all the princes
of Christendome should earnestly and throughly
aduise themselues, how to maintaine it in her former
estate, so that no notable damage may light vpon it:
and so much the rather, for that enioying her lawfull
and auncient libertie and neutralitie, with her publike
consultation it doth neuer offend any Prince in
the world. And aboue all the rest,Specially by the king of Spaine. it behoueth the
king Catholike so to doe, either by combining himselfe
with the Venetians, or by succouring them otherwise:
as well because it is verie likely, that the
Turke will not imploy his forces, onely for the subduing
of the Venetian estate: but thereby to haue a
more easie way to attempt Italie, wherof the crowne
of Spaine dooth possesse the fairest and goodliest
partes: as also because the other Princes are not
peraduenture altogither sufficient by Sea to vanquish
the enemie with any securitie, vnlesse they
shall helpe one another with monies, with vittailes,
with Souldiers, & specially with Gally-slaues,
and Marriners, which certainly is a matter very considerable:
For without doubt the true way & means
vtterly to defeate and destroy the enemie,The true way to ouerthrow the Turke, is by sea. will bee
to vanquish him by Sea, especially in these times,
wherein hee hath not an Armada of any account,
and is also greatly destitute of Marriners, and men
of commaund, that are skilful and couragious in that
profession. Moreouer, the Turkes do abhorre these



battailes by Sea, both because they are most cruell
and daungerous, and also for that in such fights they
are alwayes discomfited and ouerthrowne, and doe
know full well, that afterwardes they shall bee the
more easily vanquished and ouercome by land. So
Euagoras of Cyprus, and Conon of Athens counselled
the kings of Persia to doe against the Lacedemonians.
So Augustus hauing defeated Marcus Antonius
by Sea, subdued also his olde and victorious armie
consisting of eightie thousand footemen, and two &
twentie thousand horsemen, without any fight. The
like was done by Roger the Calabrian, Admiral to the
king of Aragon, who notwithstanding that his king
was vppon the land ouerthrowne by the king of
France, yet assaulting the French Armada by Sea,
discomfited the same, recouered that which was
lost, and carried away the fruites of both the victories.
And who knoweth not, what might haue beene
done, after the Turkish fleete was dispersed and ouerthrowne
in the yeare, 1571. And when it ranne
away of it selfe in 1572. If at the first occasion and
oportunitie that was then so happily offered, there
had beene made a choise of the best Gallies, to haue
gone presently and met with the enemie in the Arcipelago,
and in Morea, and euen as farre as Cyprus:
and if in the second good oportunitie we had followed
the happie and iudicious courage of Soranzo,
the generall Prouidatorie of Venice?
            Verie true it is,The strength and power of Venice. that the state of Venice is at this
day become so potent and mightie, not onely in respect
of the great store of golde which it hath gathered
in this long peace, and of the debts payed,



whereunto it had runne in the last warre, and somewhat
before that time: but also in regarde of the
manie Gallyes, munitions, and other preparations
for warre, which it hath prouided in this time:
that if occasion so fall out, it will peraduenture bee
well able to defend it selfe of it owne selfe: and
specially, if it would resolue it selfe at such time, as it
dooth little feare the enemie, to bee the first that
should assault and strike him, yea and to doe it indeed,
(as Alcibiades was wont to say to the Athenians)
by sending forth a mightie Armada to annoye
him, and vpon a sodaine to surprise some of those
places, which I will name in the ende of this thirde
Parte. Moreouer it hath also at this present so wel
fortified her estate, that in all reason it neede not
greatly doubt the conceites and designementes of
the Ottoman.Corfu. Catharo. Zara. Corfu, Cathara and Zara are among other
Fortes esteemed to bee inexpugnable, and so
much the rather, for that by reason of their moderate
and reasonable distance from Venice, they may
easily bee succoured and relieued, and being as it
were the keyes of the Adriatike Sea, they may also
hinder the entrance of the enemy, or enforce him of
necessitie to returne backe with all speed, least hee
remayne entangled and caught in the nette.Candie. The
Isle of Candie is likewise so wel prouided for defence
and is thought to bee so strongly guarded with
Garrisons and Munition, as it cannot bee attempted
by the Turke, without incurring his great hazard
and daunger, yea and so much the more, for that if
the enemy shoulde endeauour to disbarke his people
there, one great part of the Island hauing no



hauens or Harboroughes, is defended by nature it
self & the other part may be so well kept both by
the valour of forrain souldiers, and also by the braue
manhood of the Countrey-inhabitantes, who are
no lesse tender and carefull of their owne wel-fare,
then faithfull to their prince (prouided alwayes
that they bee by iust proportion and good aduise
distributed and deuided, some for the defence of
the Hauens, and some for the defence of the shore,)
that hee shall neuer bee able to disbarke there, or
if hee doe, it will bee to his great losse. In which
accident it will bee an easie matter to disperse the
Reliques of the enemies armie, partly because they
can very hardly bee succoured by the Turke, in
regarde of the farre distance of his Countrey and
States? and partly because his Fleete of Shippes
cannot well brooke those Seas, eyther without
daunger of breaking and rending in pieces, or
fighting with the Venetian Armada. Lastly, the
Forte of Palma,Palma. which is also built by the Venetian
Common wealth, with as religious as iudicious
an aduisement, will not onely serue (if it
please GOD) at all times for a secure and safe
defence against the enemie, if hee shoulde bee so
bolde as to trouble Istria, and to passe to Friuli,
but it will also bee a continuall and most necessarie
a Bulwarke, against all the Barbarians, which
may attempte to come and annoy Italie. And
thus much let bee saide touching the State of
Venice.If against all Italie, then which way the Turk may come thether
            
            Now touching Italie, forasmuch as I haue already
heretofore touched the reasons, which might one day



moue the Ottoman to thinke of such a course, I will in this
place set downe the most principall wayes, whereby he may
come thither, and that to answere to such persons as doe
thinke the same not onely to be a verie difficult matter, but
almost altogither impossible.
         
         
            § XIII.
            THE Turke hath two wayes,Two waies for the Turke to passe into Italie by land. whereby he may
passe from his owne Countreys and States into
Italy by land: one is (and that is the better way for
the ease of his horsemen) by departing from Belgrado
through the higher way, which is betweene
the riuers of Draua and Saua: the other on this side
of the Saua. Both of these wayes doe meete at Lubiana,
called by the Dutche Luback, and in olde
time Nauporto, a Countrey of great abundance in
all thinges, and most fit to bee (as it were) the seate
of the warre. The Citie it selfe is verie easie to bee
surprised. From hence they may goe to Goritia, or
rather by Piuca to passe by the Carse aboue Montfolcon:
both these wayes likewise doe meete at Lisonzao,
which the Turkes cal Ague-bianche, or White
waters, a riuer that is verie memorable for the battaile
of Theodorico king of the Gothes, and of Odoacre
king of the Heruli, and also for the last approach of
the Turkes, when they arriued euen as farre as San-Cassano
in Mesco vpon the Campardo, burning and
spoyling all the Countrey with most barbarous
crueltie. That way which leadeth to Goritia, is for
vittaile and for horse, more commodious then this
of Carse: which for all that, though it be verie stonie



and rockie, and also that in the Piuca there bee
some wooddes and straits, not so easie to be passed,
being neare to Scelescnytabor, which is a holde kept
by a few Clownes, yet notwithstanding the saide
way is not vnpassible for horses,Why Theodorico builded Montfalcon. and was made by
Attila, when he came to Trieste, and passed on to Aquileia.
And hereupon it came that Theodorico, after
he was become the Lord and conquerour of Italie,
was moued in this way to fortifie Mont-falcon euen
as Gradisca,And Odoacre Gradisca. a little while before, was erected and
builded in the other way by Odoacre, when hee lorded
it in Italie. A fortresse which was afterwardes
surprised by the same Theodorico, when he was sent
against Odoacre,And the Venetians, Palma. by Zeno the Emperour, and which
was also erected for the selfe same ende and purpose,
for which the Seignieurie of Venice haue
now builded Palma against the Turkes.
            The Turkish Armies, departing from Constantinople,
without comming to Mandor-Alba, or Alba-Graeca,Another way for the Turke to come into Italie.
(which is called Belgrado, and in times past
Taurono) may also come into one of these wayes, by
passing through the townes of Nis, and Precup,
where are certaine straites on this side of Sophia, and
leauing Belgrado on the right hand: or else without
touching Sophia to meete in any sort at Nouibazar,
and from thence through the Dukedome of Herzegouina
in Basna, at Bagnaluca, to meete at the last euen
in the high way, a little more then two dayes iourneyes
distant from the territorie of Venice, and very
neere vnto those places, where somtimes the Turks
made their musters when they came into Italy. This
is a verie plaine and euen way, fit also for carriages,



and for conueying of stuffe and artillarie. Wherevpon
Ammianus Marcellinus reporteth, that by the
same way Gallus the brother of Iulian was carried in
a Chariot from Betouia to Pola.
         
         
            § XIIII,
            MOreouer, the Turke, to the ende hee might
the more grieuously vexe and trouble Italie,How the Turk may annoy Italie both by land and sea at one time.
may at one and the selfe same time, sende an Armie
by land into one part of it, and an Armada by
Sea into another. So thought the other Mahamet to
haue done, & this Turke also that now is, was there
unto perswaded the last yeare by Sinan, of purpose
by that meanes the rather to diuert the king of
Spaine, and the State of Venice, that is to say, by his
fleete troubling and molesting the Adriatike Sea,
euen iust in the same sort as is afore declared,Ottranto. and
his armie assailing the coasts of Sicilie and Naples,
or of a Calabria and Puglia, replenishing all those
quarters with feare and dommage. There is yet
fresh in memorie the surprising of Otranto by the
Turkes, in the dayes of the other Mahamet, and the
fearefull fright which the Court of Rome did
sometimes take at the arriuall of the Ottoman nauie,
in the Tyrrhene sea. For costing all along Italie with
the land windes, the Easterne winde, the South-East
winde, and the South winde, and comming out of
Barbarie with a North-east winde, and a Westerne
winde, hee may most easily ouerrunne all,Examples of Augusto Cotrone, Regii, &  Sant-Angelo, euen as
farre as Ciuita Vecchia. Besides that it is well knowne
what the Turks haue done diuers times at Augusta, at



Cotrone, at Reggio, and in more auncient times what
the Saracens did at Mount Gargano, now called
Sant-Angelo.
            I know verie well how hard a matter it will be for the
Turkes to put in execution those Designements,The pleasure strength, and gouernment of Italie. which I
haue touched before to that purpose in the second Part of
this Discourse: for that (to be briefe) this most noble Prouince
of Italie, being the Garden and pleasure of the world,
is without all doubt so well fortified both by Nature and
Art: so full of Gold, and people, and vittailes also: (especially
if by Gods punishment, or by some other accident the
haruests do not proue so barren as they haue beene these last
yeares:) and lastly so carefully kept and gouerned by her Catholike
and valourous Princes as a man may resolutely conclude,
that if the Turke do come thither, either he shall retire
and returne, as heretofore diuerse his elders and predecessours
haue done, or else Italy shall become his Graue and
Sepulchre, euen as it hath alwayes beene to all Barbarians.
But for as much as it is the office of true Politike
prudence to feare an enemie, not thereby to become a Dastard,The aduice of Thucydides to thinke vpon daungers.
or a Coward (as Thucydides sayd) but with all diligence
and circumspection to procure and prouide such
remedies, as may vanquish and ouerthrow him: I will
briefly set downe, how wee may diuerse wayes meete with
those and such other daungers, that may hang ouer Italie by
reason of the Ottoman Armies, and also what remedies
may be most profitable and effectuall in this present
warre, and therefore are greatly feared by the Turks themselues.
         
         
            § XV.
            AMong other remedies, that were proposed,
when Mahamet the second surprise Ottranto,



(as I tolde you) to diuerte him from Italie,The opinion of Martin de Segoni for diuerting the warres from Italie. one Martiu
de Segoni Bishoppe of Dulcigno, as wee reade in
a Treatise that hee wrote thereof to Pope Sixtus
the Fourth, propounded this present remedy,
which it delighteth mee to report in his owne verie
wordes. Pannonum Rex (sayeth hee) cum suo
Exercitu, confederatisque populis, praesentet se ad Danubium,
fama praecedente quod in Rasciam sit traiecturus:
futurum inde omnium Turcorum multitudine sibi obuiā
ad I strii traiectum progrediente, Gentes nuper Valonam
& ad alia Epiri maritima loca missae, ad Italiam transfretandae,
statim ob metum Pannonum ad castra Turchi
reuocentur. That is to say, Let the King of Hungarie
with his Armie and Confederates present himselfe
at the Danowe, with a fame and rumor first
geuen out, that hee is minded to passe ouer into
Rascia: and thereupon will it come to passe, that
al the Turkes multitude proceeding to meet with
him at the passage of the (Danowe where it is called)
Ister, the souldiers which were lately sent to
Valona, and to other maritimall places of Epirus, of
purpose to bee transported into Italie, presently for
feare of the Hungarians, shall be called backe to the
Turkes Campe.
            Now wee hauing in steade of the king of
Hungarie, the Emperour, and the Prince of Transyluania,
I will discourse to the same purpose, as
well of the one as of the other, so far forth as shall
bee sufficient most clearely to make knowne, what
hinderance and detriment it would bee to Christendome,
if these two Princes,Counsell to make a diuerting warre. should make peace
with the Turke, at the least so speedily as it is doubted



they will: because among all the good meanes
that may bee vsed to secure a state from their most
mightie enemies, there is none so safe and approued
by great Captaines then this course of diuerting
warre.Hannibal. As among others Hannibal told Antiochus
when hee aduised him to set vpon Macedonia, to
the end King Philip might not send ayde to the Romaines:K. Hieron.
and Hieron King of Syracusa, when hee
aduised the Romanes to set vpon Africa, to the end
the Carthagenians might not send succours to Hannibal
in Italie.
         
         
            § XVI.
            THE Emperour hath already his weapons in
hand:Why the Emperour should not make peace with the Turk and although indeed hee haue lost
some places, yet hee hath also gotten some others.
The warre is not altogether inconuenient or incommodious,
by reason of the nearenesse thereof. The
Souldiers haue now begunne to enure themselues
to the warres, and to take courage against the horrible
shoutinges and outcries of the Enemie, and are
alreadie accustomed to endure cold and frost. The
Captaines haue learned the Militarie Discipline,
and the manner of fighting with the Turkes: if
our Souldiers issue foorth into the field before our
enemies, wee may attempt to recouer eyther by
siedge, or surprise some of those places that haue
beene lost: yea and so much the rather, for that it
will bee a harde matter for the Turkes to succour
it, because those that are gone home to their houses,
cannot in time returne in so great a multitude for



want of grasse and vittailes: and those that remaine
in the frontiers are not able and sufficient both to
offend and defend. Moreouer, there is not a small
number of those, that haue refused to stay in Hungarie,
because they had not wherewith to liue, and
because they would auoyde the distemperature of
that colde ayre, which will vse all their arte and cunning
to stay at home.
            Let vs adde hereunto,The Princes of Germanie to ayde the Emperour. that now is the onely time,
wherein it is to bee hoped, that all the Princes of
Germanie, both great and smal, wil waken and rouse
themselues in earnest, because it is not now so much
in question to defende the Hungarians, who are naturally
hated by the Dutch (as many other Nations
doe also hate one another) as it is to defend themselues,
their wiues, their children, and their owne
riches. In which point, if they conceyue peraduenture,
that they might keepe and enioy al these things
aforesaid, more safely and securely vnder the gouernement
of the Turke, they may bee verie easily
certified of the truth of this their conceit, when they
shall beholde the Tragicall spectacles of Greece,The lamentable state of Greece.
which since it hath beene vanquished by the Turks,
hath remained like the Iewes, without King, without
Scepter, without libertie, without titles, without
riches, yea, and (a most horrible matter to report)
euen without the comfort of the tender embracements
of their owne naturall children.
            Whereas, if the warre continue, who can with
any reason doubt,Reasons to continue the warre. but that the Princes of the Empire
shall of necessitie be enforced earnestly to assist
and ayde both the Emperour and themselues? because



it is in all likelihoode to be feared, that Mahamet
will set forward his Armie either towards Toccai,Toccai. Vienna.
of purpose to hinder the vnion of the Emperour
and the Transyluanian, or to Vienna, as he was perswaded
to haue done, not long ago by Sinan, who
shewed vnto him the easinesse of winning it, the
glorie that would redound vnto him thereby, and
the great importance of the enterprise:Why the Turk withdrew his armie out of Croatia. And also
for that from the languishing of the head proceedeth the
weaknesse of the members. And it may be, that he commaunded
his armie to retyre out of Croatia, not onely
because he knew the iealousie which the Italian
Princes doe carrie of their owne affaires, and specially
the Venetians, who in that respect haue put
themselues in defence with their new fortresse of
Palma: but also because hee would vnite all his forces
togither, & so become the stronger to performe
the said enterprise. But howsoeuer it bee, certaine it
is that he hath not withdrawne it for any giftes or
rewardes which he hath receiued from the Venetians,
as some haue falsly beleeued. Againe, that wee
may thinke the better of this daunger, it is a matter
worthie of good consideration, that Mahamet was
enclined to this enterprise from his childhoode, in
so much as euen at that time hee made humble supplication
to his father, that hee would reserue that
glorie for him: which without all doubt, if (as God
forbid) it should so fall out and come to passe in
deed, would not onely proue to bee a most notable
losse to the Empire, but also in particular to all Italie.
For so hauing gotten the possession of that key,
which is of greatest importaunce to open him the



way into the entrance of all those Countries, he shall
also haue a more readie and easie passage into the
fairest and goodliest part of the world, which is the
verie vttermost scope and end of all the Ottoman designements.The way for the Turkes to come to Vienna.
For that, euen as he hath a free way to
come to Vienna, by passing betweene the Danow and
the Draua, in lower Hungarie, and so without any
impediment to Giauerino (a Fort, that by the aduice
of Alfonso Duke of Ferrara was caused to be made at
the verie selfe same time that Soliman arriued there
by the selfe same way, and where at this day also, being
possessed by the Turks in maner and sort (as Philippo
Pigafetta hath written) they may easily passe to
trouble and vexe both Astria, and Stiria.)Three other wayes for the Turke (if hee obtaine Vienna) to come into Italie. So if hee
should be possessed of Vienna, hee may without all
doubt the more easily assault Italie by two other
wayes, which I haue not as yet named. The one is,
by the way of Tiroll, descending by the Alpes of
Trento into the Champaignes of Verona, where Alarico
entered: or by those of Bassano, which is a way
that hath beene often vsed by the Dutche: the other
is, that of Villaco, wich commeth directly from Vienna,
and meeteth either at Frioli, or at Venzone, or
at Ciuidale. The Turkes also in such a case may take
another way, which was heretofore made by the
Barbarians, that is to say, the way of Tolmezo in Carnia,
which may also meete at Cadore: but that shall
not be to any great purpose for them.
            But for as much as among those things, which hinder
the Emperour from such aydes and succours as he desireth
and as without all doubt would be most sit and conuenient
for this present businesse, there are three especially that are



worthy of greatest consideration: it shall not be amisse to
touch them.
         
         
            § XVII.
            THe first thing is,The speches that hinder the Emperour from necessary aydes of the Christian Princes. the voice that runneth amongst
the many Protestants of the Empire: that if his
Emperial Maiestie should become the cōqueror of
the Turke, they shall bee of necessitie enforced to
yeeld obedience to the Pope of Rome (as they call
him) a matter that is abhorred by the common sort
of people, but much more by the great Princes and
Potentates there: by the great Princes especially, because
they haue vsurped a dominion vpon the greatest
Ecclesiasticall liuings and reuenues: by the common
people, because they are perswaded therevnto
by the Protestant Ministers, as namely by the Caluinists
and Lutherans, who doe resolutely aduise
them rather to obey the Turke then the Pope, and
therefore Caluanisme is a kind of disposition to Mahametisme,
as many very learned men haue written. Besides
that both the great Potentates, & also the common
Subiects there haue suffered themselues most easily
to be perswaded to this impietie and vngodlinesse,
onely in regarde of the most sensuall and licencious
life, which they are thereby permitted to lead.
            The second thing is (which is so peremptorily disputed
by many) that the Emperor is to make peace
with the Turke, because the Empire sheweth it selfe
so backewarde and faint to relieue him: as well for
that it feareth to spend her treasure to no purpose, as



also for that it being of it selfe enclined to peace,The backewardnes of the Empire in relieuing the Emperour.
it doeth willingly take aduauntage of this occasion:
which also ministreth matter to many Christian
Princes, especially to the Polack, and to the
Venetians, that they doe not stirre eyther little or
much against the Turke, because they suspect they
shall bee abandoned and forsaken, when the
cause is at the best, and that they shall spend themselues
without any gaine or profite. And it seemeth
that it is made the more credible by this, for that
it is malitiously giuen out and published to the
world by those Imperialists, which haue no greate
inclination towardes that most religious house of
Austria, vz. That the Emperour is not greatly inclined
to warre: That hee keepeth himselfe continually
retyred in Bohemia, in Prage, in his pallace
because hee feareth some violent death? whereunto
hee is the rather induced eyther by reason of the
conspiracie which was lately discouered, or of that
which a certaine Englishman called Dee,M. Iohn Dec. foretold
him (a matter in sooth no lesse superstitious then
vnworthie to bee apprehended and beleeued by a
Prince that is so wise and feareth God.) But certainely
if it were true, that the Emperour either for
these or for som other reasōs did now incline toward
peace, it had beene more safe counsell and aduise
for him, to haue resolued on it, euen in the beginning
and at the first, rather then at this time, in regarde
of such reasons as I haue heretofore declared,
and also more at large in a certaine discourse, which
I haue made vpon this point euen to this day. And
thus also was Archduke Ferdinando aduised by Peter



the Vaiuode of Moldauia,The aduise of Peter the Vaiuode of Moldauia. who if he had not dyed
in the yeare 1594. in the mountaines of Bolzano
was vtterly resolued (though hee was a man of the
Greekish sect and religion) to haue come and kissed
the feet of our Pope, as I haue declared in due order
and place.
            The thirde and last thing is, That if the
Empire on the one side bee not willing to contribute
to so great expenses,The difficultie of the requests made by the Imperial princes. vnlesse the Conquestes
that may bee made and atchieued, become vnited
to the Empire it selfe: and if the Emperour on the
other side will not consent thereunto, by reason of
the pretenses and challenges, which hee hath to
Hungarie, being a state of his own, it seemeth that
both the one partie and the other, doe propound
matters so difficult, that none of them are likely to
bee effected. True it is, that wee ought to thinke
and belieue that the Emperour knoweth full well,
if hee should shew himselfe contented to doe that
which the Imperiall Princes doe request at his
handes, hee should thereby preiudice himselfe, &
yet those Princes would afterwardes forbeare to
doo that in deedes, which they offer in wordes.
And thus much let bee sayde touching the Emperour.
         
         
            § XVIII.
            NOw touching the Prince of Transyluania,The Prince of Transyluania, and his valor.
who may now serue (as the Second Champion)
in stead of the former King of Hungarie, there is
no doubt to be made, but that hee is both in religion



and in heart a most fierce and eagre enemie agaynst
the Turkes. That which hee hath done hitherto,
(say what they list of him, such as either are
not well informed or too affectionate and passionate
in the cause) doth yeeld vnto all the world a
most cleare and manifest testimonie, that hee is no
lesse braue in bestirring himselfe to fight, and resolute
in his courses, then fortunate in his actions, and
euen such a one as the auncients required a Captaine
to be. And this not by the fauour of fabulous
fortune, but in truth by the grace of that Lord, who
in the holy Scriptures is called the Lord of Hostes,
by whom like a new Dauid or Iudas Machabaeus, hee
is louingly defended and protected.Why the Turks feare him. He is also greatly
feared of the Turkes by reason of certaine popular
and common predictions of theirs, which although
they be in deed but light and vaine, yet doe
they make a great impression in the mindes of barbarous
and base people, and specially of the Mahometanes,
who do absolutely beleeue Fatum, or Destinie.
Among these their diuinations and Foreboadings,A Prophecie of the Turkes for Transyluania.
they hold this one to be of great account and
reckoning, which saith, That from the cliffes of the
Mountaines of Transyluania, there shall one day
come forth a Prince, who shall ouercome and bring
to nothing the Ottoman Empire. So saith Flauius
Vopiscus, in the life of the Emperour Florian, That in
his dayes it was prophecied of an Hungarian prince
which in time should reduce all the Barbarians vnder
his commaund and gouernment. And the like
also is read in Suetonius Tranquillus of the Emperour
Galba (For neuer yet did Princes want their flatterers.)



Moreouer the Turkes doe also constantly beleeue,Another prophecie touching the end of Mahamets sect. Musulmani.
that the Sect of Mahamet is not to last any longer
then for a thousand yeares, which tearme according
to our computation cannot be farre of: and that the
Musulmani, (for so the Mahametists doe call themselues,
that is (Truly religious people which beleeue aright)
are not to haue aboue fourteene or fifteene
Emperours: and therefore they do greatly erre, that
recken seuenteene of them at this day. This Mahamet,
who now liueth may bee reckoned the foureteenth
or fifteenth: for Mose or Musa (as they call
him) some doe reckon him among them, and some
doe not. Lastly it is also most true, that the Turkes
doe greatly feare the Transyluanian, and in that respect
doe diuerse and sundrie wayes endeuour,Why the Turkes do go about to bereaue him of his life. not
onely most diuelishly to weaken that valorous courage,
which he sheweth against them, but also to depriue
him of his life: persuading themselues for certaintie
(besides all that which hath beene touched
before) that he hath secrete intelligences, euen with
in the Citie of Constantinople, to ouerthrow that
estate: & that if his glorie & renown do encrease, the
matter will easily be brought to passe, for that he is so
willingly followed and accompanied by the Transyluanians
themselues, who doe most readily obey
him, and for that also hee is greatly desired and wished
by the Walachians, the Rascians, the Bulgarians,
the Sicilians, and all other warlike and hardie
Nations to bee their Lord and Maister. And that
this is true, I will briefly declare, because I do
thinke that for the better vnderstanding of the state
of this present warre, it will bee verie necessarie to



know what these peoples are.
         
         
            § XIX.
            THe Transyluanians without all doubt are esteemed
to bee the most warlike people of all Europe.The Transyluanian Nation.
These togither with the Moldauians, and
Walachians, are the auncient Dacians,Why the Romans paied tribute to the Dacians. whom the
Romans so greatly feared: insomuch as when they
had ouerthrowne the Armies of the Emperour Domitian,
the Romanes were forced to pay them tribute
vnder the same Domitian, vnder Nerua, and in
the beginning of Traians Empire, vpon condition
that they should not passe ouer the Danow to annoy
and endommage their Countries. This is manifestly
made knowne to the Turkes themselues, by the
discomfitures which many times haue beene giuen
them by Coruinus, by the two Battories, and lastly by
this third man, who at this day is in warre agaynst
them.
            Moreouer, Michael the Vaiuode of Walacchia,Michael the Vaiuode of Walachia.
although in times past he held that gouernement of
the Turke, yet now he is vnder the obedience of the
Transyluanian: and withour doubt it standeth him
greatly in hand to cōtinue in that protectiō, because
hee may not now any longer trust the Turkes, who
haue beene so oftentimes displeased and discontented
with him, and specially for the slaughter which
he made of those, that vnder his promise of peace
were sent by Hassan Bassa into Walacchia. Besides
the Walachians, whose valour is verie well knowne
to the Turkes, when they serued vnder the conduct



of Dracola their most valiant Captaine, the said Vaiuode
is attended for Souldiers with many Hungarians
and Transyluanians,Captaine Dracola. some few Albanians, Grecians,
Bulgarians, and Rascians.The Vaiuodes souldiers. Hee hath not many
Arcubusiers, as also the Transyluanian himselfe hath
no great store of them. For all these Nations, and
especially the Hungarians doe vsually fight at hand,
and on horsebacke with Launces, and with a wonderfull
courage shew their faces to their enemies.
            The Rascians,The Rascians. who in the Councill of Constance
be called Sirfi, are a people that haue their originall
offspring, from the vpper Misia, which now is called
Seruia and Rascia. They by reason of the Turkish
wars did heretofore retire thēselues to the further
side of the Danow, and not to this side, as some haue
writtē: & at this present they dwel nigh to Temesuar,
Lippa, & those parts. They did in times past rebell against
the Turke & now do serue the Transyluanian.
            The Bulgarians,The Bulgarians. some do inhabite all that Country
which was called the lower Misia, euen to the
Danow, ouer against Walachia: some inhabit Thracia,
togither with the Grecians, and others in Macedonia,
which now also is inhabited with Grecians, with
Seruians, and with Albanians. The Bulgarians are a
braue and valorous people. Some of them that haue
fled out of their owne Countrey, doe serue the
Transiluanian, and no doubt many others woulde
runne also vnto him, if he had sufficient meanes to
entertaine them. They are verie apt to make a tumult
and insurrection, as well in their owne Countrey,
as also among their neighbours, if they were
cherished and heartned thereunto, especially by



the Transyluanian,The Prince of Transyluania compared to Alexander the Great. whome they do admire no
lesse, then that Alexander the Great, who was
halfe their Countryman, that is to say, Pella, a
place of Macedonia: and vnto whome hee hath
with great iudgement beene likened, by Girolamo
Frachetta in those orations, which he hath written to
this valourous Prince.
            The Siculi or Sicilians,The Siculi or Sithulians who inhabite the
mountaines towardes Polonia and Moldauia, and
that parte of the Countrey which is somewhat
more hilly, are fierce and sturdie Clownes, resembling
the Tartarians, more then any other
Christians of those quarters: and therefore they
should bee called Sythuli: They are rather footmen
then horsemen, and haue also some Arcubusiers.
They followed the Prince of Transyluania
in the yeare 1595. when hee passed into Walachia
against Sinan, at which time the said Sinan did
most shamefully run away:Why the Siculi rebelled. But hauing receiued a
promise of the Prince, that their Noblemen should
bee exempted from some subiection, in regarde of
an offer, which they made to conquere as much
Countrey more, as that was which they did enioy:
when they perceiued that their intention &
his promise was not kept and performed, they rebelled
and made an insurrection, while the prince
was at Prage: but afterwardes with the punishment
of some of the Principalles, and two hundred
others, they were well quieted and pacifyed.
         
         
            
            § XX.
            THE prince of Transyluania doeth not entertayne
and receiue vnder his Enseignes,The Prince of Transyluania wanteth money. all those
peoples that doe thus admire him, and so greatly
desire him to be their Captaine and Lord: because
he hath no good meanes for money to pay them:
for without stipends or wages, it is not possible that
souldiers can bee satisfied and maintained: neither
are their spoyles, prayes, and booties sufficient to
feede them, and keepe them contented, nor their
Haruestes and Collections, to supply the wantes of
so great a number, especially in the times of warre,
wherein all things grow from worse to worse.How his want is to be supplyed. In
such sorte as I doe conclude, that forasmuch as our
Christian Princes haue no better means to maintain
this warre against the Turke, and that in some remote
place, and farre distant from their own countryes
and States, nor a more easie and safe waye to
ouercome him, then by obeying and following euen
the very selfe same counsell which Demosthenes
gaue to the Athenians,The Counsell of Demosthenes to the Athenians, applyed to this purpose by the Author. when the people of Olinthus
(a Cittie of Thracia) craued their aide and succours
against Philip, the Father of Alexander, and King of
Macedonie, at such time as hee went about to assaulte
them: I will bee also so bold (though not in such eloquent
termes as that most famous Oratour did
vse) to tell them, that the fittest and meetest counsell
which can be giuen them for the common good, is
with all speede to succour and relieue this couragious
youth (as in part the Pope, & the most religious



king of Spaine haue done) with some part of those
treasures which they haue receiued from God, to
be spent in the seruice of his diuine Maiestie, and
their owne saluation. For there is no one thing that
doth more hinder the propagation of the Gospell of
Iesus Christ, and the good successe of their actions
against the cōmon enemy, then to want money sufficient
for his necessities, or rather not to make some
greater preparations and prouisions for so weightie
an enterprise. And so much the more, for that hee is
compelled to spend a good portion of that little,
which he hath in mainteyning his forces that are diuided,
partly in Walachia to keepe them in awe for
feare of their reuolt to the Turkes, and partly in diuerse
places of Transyluania towards Moldauia, for
feare of the Moldauians, of the Tartarians, and of
other his enemies.The Transyluanian may peraduenture be forced to take some other corse that may be dangerous to Christendom. Besides that it may be with great
reason suspected and feared, least if this Prince shall
want meanes and habilitie to maintaine himselfe
with forces in the field against the enemie, rather
then he will yeeld and submit himselfe againe to an
Infidel Prince, he wil resolue vpon some such course
as he thinketh more godly and pleasing to God, and
more safe and secure for himselfe: which peraduenture
may redound to the great damage and hinderance
of Christendome, for the losse that it should
receiue in those partes of so valiant a Prince, as (I
feare mee) it hath some sauour and taste of it alreadie.
            And now for as much as I haue shewed, that it is not
good for the Emperour and Transiluanian to make peace
with the Turke, I will for the last poynt discouer vnto



you,What thinges the Turke especially feareth. the thinges which the enemie doeth greatliest feare,
and what may be performed on our behalfe to annoy him
most.
         
         
            § XXI.
            FIrst the Turke feareth least the Princes of Italie
will resolue in earnest to succour the Emperour
and the Transyluanian either with men,The Princes of Italie. The Duke of Florence. The Pope. or with
money. He seeth, that the great Duke of Tuscane
hath sent his brother and his Neuewes to the one,
and Capitaines and presents to the other. That the
Pope sent the last yeare his Neuew with a good armie
into Hungarie, by meanes wherof the Garrison
of Strigonia and Vicegrado was the sooner yeelded:
and moreouer that he furnisheth both the one and
the other with money: yea, and likely it is, that as
he is able, he will do so still, vntill the warre bee ended.
He perceiueth also, that the going of the Duke
of Mantua into Hungarie made his Souldiers beleeue,The Duke of Mantua. The Venetians
that the other Italian Princes would likewise
make some stirre. He doubteth, least the Venetians
will be at the last of necessitie compelled to take vp
armes against him, either for their owne proper interest
and benefite, or by the continuall and instant
motions of the Pope, as they did in the times of Leo
the ix. of Nicholas the 2. of Gelasius the 2. of Alexander
the 2. of Galixtus the 2. of Clement the 3. of Nicholas
the 4. and of other Popes: so that not onely
for the singular benefites which they haue done to
Christendome, they haue deserued and obtained
verie great preheminencies and priuiledges, at the



hands of the Emperour and the Popes, but also for
their pietie and obedience to the Sea Apostolike,
but also by common consent to bee called the defenders
and fortresse of Christian Religion. And
hereupon it commeth that the Turke dare not at
this time minister vnto them any occasion of the
least discontentment in the world, but doth readily
satisfie them in any matter, which they request of
him.
         
         
            § XXII.
            MOreouer hee doubteth that Polonia also will
rise vp against him:Polonia. knowing for certaintie,
that the Pope offereth to furnish it with good store
of money, whereof the meaner and poorer sort of
the people in that kingdome are verie greedie, and
desirous. For they think, that they cannot in any better
sort purchase desert to themselues from their
Prince, for which they may afterwards in conuenient
time craue reward at his hands, thē to serue him
in his warres. This suspition and doubt of his, is the
more encreased in him, because hee knoweth that
the king of Spaine did not answere the letters of the
King of Polonia, but vntill now at the last, when hee
was somewhat discontented with the peace which
Maximilian had concluded with that kingdome.
And further,Three reasons why if Polonia rise against the Turke, hee shall be forced to make a defensiue warre. the Turke knoweth full well, that if
Polonia, should once in earnest resolue vppon this
point, he should of necessitie be compelled to make
a defensiue war, rather then an offensiue, to his exceeding
great disaduantage, and that for 3. reasons.
            

               
1 The first, because thereby he must needes loose
Moldauia,Hieremie the Vaiuode of Moldauia. for that the Polack hath appointed for
Vaiuode of that prouince, one Hieremie, who is a
man that sheweth himselfe not altogither alienated
misseaffected towards our affaires of Christendom:
and who also in respect that hee may in good time
vnderstand any stirres that the Turke shal make, and
minister good store of vittailes to the campe is one,
that will be worthie of no small regard and consideration
in this present warre. And therefore I may
not forbeare in such an important poynt to tel you,
that it shall alwayes be good for our Lord and his
Ministers to maintaine good intelligence with the
said Hieremie, and that they be carefull to looke what
sort of persons they send to treate with him, and
how they write vnto him: for these people, who be
the verie Daui & Getae in Terence, are by nature most
suspicious. It will be good also to honour him greetly
and to seeme most willing to visite such as he shal
send either to Rome, or to treate with the Nuntioes
Apostolike. For the Turke endeuouring by
diuerse and sundrie meanes to bind him to himselfe,
or wholy to alienate him from vs, or else at the least
to cousen and deceiue him: (all cunning fetches
much vsed by the Ottomans) it cannot bee but
verie helpefull and beneficiall to vs, to maintaine
him, as much as may be, in good loue and amitie
with vs.
            2 The second reason is,The Cosacchi because thereby, he shall
haue the Cosacchi more openly to oppose themselues
against him, as wel for that they be subiects of
the K. of Polonia (as the Vscocchi be of the Emperour)



and receiue their Generall from him, whome the
Souldiers doe ordinarily obey: as also for that
they may at their pleasure burne and destroy
Vosia, which is a Fortresse of the Turkes,Vosia. Boristhenes situate
at the mouth of the Riuer Boristhenes, called by
the Polackes Occhiacouia, and by the Moldauians
Dassoua: as in the yeare 1583, they burnt Bendero,Bendero.
their Generall being then Ianzo the Hungarian,Ianzo.
who was appointed ouer them by K. Stephen of
Polonia. Many other harmes and annoyances they
may also doo vnto him, as they did vnder Suita
the Russian,Suita. Gonte Ianus. and vnder Conte Ianus sonne of Basilius
the Duke of Ostroua, and other their Captains, which
they likewise receyued from the Polonians. These
Cosacchi doo dwell in an Island of Boristhenes, almost
foure dayes iourneyes aboue Vosia. The Island is
called Chirches, and the Riuer Boristhenes is by them
termed Nis, which is the Niepro. They are Arcubuziers,
and excellent Archers, and both by nature
and open profession verie greate enemies to the
Turkes. Many of them doo serue at this day the
Transyluanian, the foresaid Hieremie and Michael.
Others doo attend and goe with the Chanceller of
Polonia: and others are also dispersed and scattered
in Podolia. But all of them with great courage doo
shewe their faces to the Tartarians, and Turks.
            3. The last reason is, because the Polacke onely,The passage more easie to Constantinople.
or at least more then any other Prince, is able to
make the passage to Constantinople more easie for
our people: for that is the place, whether we must
needes goe at the last, if we meane to doo any good
in deed. And so much the more, for that if the Polack,



doo shew himselfe to bee an enemie to the
Turke, then the Transyluanian shall not neede to
feare the passage, which his Armie must make into
Walachia. For the way of Moldauia without
touching Walachia, would bee verie incommodious
for it, aswell because it runneth too neare
vnto the sea, as also because if hee would passe
into Bulgaria, hee must returne backwardes to
goe into the Countrey, that they may keepe and
feede his horses, and to auoyde the vnlucky place
of Varna.
            And here by the way, I will not forbeare to aduertise
you of an errour, which is of no small moment, as I
haue also endeauored my selfe to doe, in sundry fitte places
of this narration, of diuers others which peraduenture
will not proue altogether vnprofitable, to such as are
delighted with the like studies.Errors touching Moldauia, and Walachia. And the error is this,
that P. Iouius describing the said Prouinces of Walachia
and Moldauia, beeing deceiued by the ambiguous
and doubtfull worde of Polackes, confoundeth the one
of them with the other. And so are others also deceyued
who doo thinke that to bee Walachia, which the
Hungarians call Transalpina the lesser, whereas in
comparison of Moldauia, it should bee called Transalpina
the Greater. Those are likewise in an error, who do
hold, that walachia called by the Turkes Islakia, deriuing
the name from the ancient Romane Flacci, is also termed
by them Bogdania & Cara Bogdania,Islakia. Bogdania. Cara Bogdania. for by that
name they terme Moldauia (and not Walachria) eyther
because it is very plentifull of that kinde of graine, which
wee call Saracino, and Formentone, that is to say, Wheat,
whereof Formentie is made, Or because one of those Princes



of Moldauia, with whom the Turkes had some long
warre, was called Bogdano, that is to say, Deodato. i.
Gods gift, adding therevnto for his praenomen or forename
Cara, which signifieth Blacke. And it is called also
Moldauia of the Daui, who were the frist inhabiters therof,
and rather for the softnesse and fatnesse of the moulde
of that soyle, then for the blackenesse of it, as he thought,
that called it Mori-Dauia.
            But returning backe againe to Polonia, I will here
set downe also the aunswere, which the Chanceller
of that kingdome made to Sinan Bassa, at such time
as he required and demaunded the tribute, which he
wrongfully pretended to bee due to his Lord and
maister: to the end that thereby may be knowne the
benefite and profite, that in all reason is to bee expected
of this cōbination, if the Polonian will yeeld
vnto it.The answer of the Chanceller of Polonia to the demaunds of Sinan. Sinan caused a message to be deliuered to
the Chanceller, that without delay hee should pay
the said tribute: or else he would force him to leaue
the Frontiers, and to retire to the Icie Sea. The
Chanceller caused answere to bee redeliuerd backe
vnto him, that hee would not stay for him in his
owne Countrey of Polonia, but that he would enter
into the Ottomans Territories, and proceed with all
speed euen to the banks of the Danow, & fortifying
them on both sides, would make the place more easie
to passe vp further into those Countreyes of the
Turke. This is Dacia Ripensis,Dacia Ripensis. Constantine the Emperour. which as you may read
in Procopius, was fortifyed by the Romanes. Zozimus
doth greatly blame Constantine the Emperour, because
he forsooke and abandoned the Fortes of the
Danow: the reliques whereof are yet to be seene in



Roscic, Vidim, Nicopolis, Silistria, and other places that
are possessed by the Turkes.
         
         
            § XXIII.
            MOreouer,Why the Turke feareth Moscouia. the Ottoman not only esteemeth the
Pope to be the head and chiefe of all the princes
Christian, so that by his auctoritie hee may easily
vnite now some, and then some of them against him
but also accounteth him to be as a temporall prince,
in regard of that which he possesseth in Italie:By whar names the Turkes, and Persians call the Pope. and
thereupon he calleth him Franch-Beg, the Prince of
Italie, or of the Italians, and Rum-Beg, the prince of
Rome, whom the Persians call in their language
Rum-Schach.The Califa. The Czar of Moscouia. Halife and Califa the Turkes call the
Vicar of God, a title, which most impiously the ancient
Agarenes began to appropriate to themselues.
So that the Turke dooth greatly feare, least the
Pope should send some person of credite into Moscouia,
to solicite the vnion of that prince with the
Emperour, which would bee a matter of great losse
vnto him: or at least that he should perswade him
to let or hinder the comming foorth of the Tartarians:
as we haue shewed before, how hee may easily
doe it.
            He also feareth the armies and power of the Czar
or Zar of Moscouia, for so the Moscouites doe call
their prince: besides the reasons before alledged, as
well for that he doth absolutely commaund and gouerne
his subiects, and therefore it seemeth that among
al the princes of the world, he is the only man



that may compare with him: as also for that he doth
verie well remember the discomfitures which the
Moscouites haue giuen to the Turkes (for the Turkish
princes doe vse to record in writing the actions
of their ancesters) and in particular, when thy went
about at the last to draw the Tana into the Vlga, they
were by the Moscouites (who had vnited themselues
with the Tartarians of Precop,) scattered and put to
flight.
            Hee feareth the Czar likewise,The Turke feareth the vnion of the Moscouite with the church of Rome▪ because hee
doubteth least vpon this occasion there followe a
treatie of the vnion of that prince, with the Church
of Rome, as it hapned in the times of Adrian the 6,
of Leo the 10. and of Clement the 7. Popes of Rome,
in maner and sort as it is written by Albertus
Campensis, and as it is more at large recorded
in the Moscouia of father Antonio Posseuino, a
greate minister of the seruice of God, sent of late
for the same purpose by Gregorie the 13. to Iohn Basilius,
vpon occasion of the warre, which the said Iohn
had with Stephen king of Polonia. Or rather he feareth
the Moscouite, because hee suspecteth, that if he
should become the head and chiefe of all the Grecicians,He feareth the Moscouits attempt to trouble his state.
it would so much the more encourage and
hearten that Nation to make an insurrection and
rebellion in the Ottoman state. These are matters that
might peraduenture be brought to passe and sort to
good issue, if among the Moscouites there were lesse
ignorance in matters appertaininh to God, so that a
man might freely conuerse with them,A wish of the Authors, that these things may come to passe, & how. and preach
the worde of Christ: and in briefe, if these vnions
were not of purpose negociated and handled, rather



by such cunning and craftie deuises the more easily
to enlarge Dominion and Schisme, then for any
thing else: euen as the Turke vnder the amitie and
friendship, which hath beene sought and offered vnto
him by many Princes, hath entred and pierced
into the bowels of Europe. But of this point we doe
not nowe stande in feare: and therefore I wish that
we would hope in the Lord, and pray that he would
take away from their eyes that vaile of obstinacie,
which hath hindered them from seeing the goodly
light of the euangelicall truth, and that he would renue
in the great duke now liuing, or in his successors
those spirites,Basilius. which were in that same Basilius, who
by the meanes and mediation of Iohn king of Denmarke,
requested of Pope Iulie the second, that hee
might send his Ambassodours to the Councell, not
for any ambition, or ostentation, or priuate interest,
but onely to humble himselfe in truth, and
sinceritie vnder the mightie hand of God, and to visite
the Pope.
            This suspition is increased in the Turke,The submission of the Maroniti to the Church of Rom. by the
late humiliation, which was made to the Church of
Rome by the Maroniti, (who (as Haythone writeth)
doe inhabite about the Mount Libanus in Soria) procured
and wrought by the Iesuites, and by Vecchietti,
with the protection and patronage of pope Gregorie
the 13. and of Ferdinando the great Duke of
Tuscane.The submission likewise of the Russiou Bishops. But much more is he dismayed at the obedience
which those Bishops of Russia haue of late
yeelded, who in the names of themselues, and of
the Russians which are subiects vnto them, by the
zeale of Sigismond king of Polonia, haue humbled



themselues to Pope Clement the viii. whereof Cardinall
Baronius hath more particularly written in
his learned Annales Ecclesiasticall. And this
matter is so much the more considerable, for that
especially by the meanes and helpe of the Russians,
the conuersion and vniting of the Moscouites,
may exceeding easily bee procured: and also for
that with lesse expenses and danger, passage may be
made by Moscouia into Asia, for the sowing and
planting of the Faith of Iesus Christ, then by all the
other parts of the world besides.
            Lastly, the Turke feareth the Moscouite,The Moscouites Embassadors to the Emperour. because
he suspecteth, that hee will-dispose himselfe
to moue warre against him, as often as hee seeth the
Emperour and Empire to doo the like in earnest.
And in this point consisteth the whole matter, as it
was signified to the Emperours Maiestie by the
Embassadors of Moscouia, that were last sent vnto
him from the Prince of Moscouia with verie rich
presentes, at the instigation and exhortation of Alessandro
Cumuli the Popes Agent.
         
         
            § XXIIII.
            THE Ottoman likewise feareth,Why the Turke feareth Tartaria. that his Holines
will send Agentes, especially men of great authority
and good iudgement to the Tartarians, aswell
those that are free, as those that are subiect to
the Tartar of Crimo, to the end that by offering &
giuing Money to certaine chiefe persons, which are
of greatest reputation among them (as it is vsed also
among the Swizzers) they should prouide, that



they stirre not out of their own Countrey: with an
open publication of the Popes name, as at other
times it hath beene done. For all the Tartarians
are of an opinion, that the Pope hath exceeding
store of treasure, and is a man of great power and
authority,Why the Tartarians haue come in so smal a number to aide the Turke. and therefore they will bee very readilie
resolued to pleasure him in any thing. And it is
holden for certain among the Turkes, that the Emperour
and the Transyluanian did so this last yeare,
because the Tartarians came vnto them in so small
a number, and not in that multitude, as they had
prouided, and as some of vs (Christians) did vainely
and falsly belieue. And so much the more is our
vaine opinion confuted, because it is notoriously
known, that Alipe Chan, treating with Visconte the
Nuntio for some aide, that hee might bee preserued
in his State against his Brother Hirach, was not able
to procure many of his owne people to be sent
foorth out of his owne Countrey. I know it wel
that some haue attributed the cause of this defect of
the Tartarians to the discontentmentes,Why the Tartarians were disconted with Amurath. which they
haue conceyued against Amurath, for the peace
which hee made with the Persians: For (say they)
they had thought to haue gotten vpon the Persian,
before this peace had beene concluded, so safe
a passage to goe to Mecca, as without passing thorough
the Turkes Countrey, they might freelie
haue gone thether. But I know that these men are
greatlie deceyued. For they were not the Tartarians
of Crimo, that were so greatlie discontented
with the Turke: but those that were vnder the obedience
of Vsbeg-Chan (of whome I haue somewhat



spoken before:) and those also not for that
cause which they alledge. For (if I be not in an errour)
although they would haue gained and gotten
into their handes all the whole Persian Estate and
kingdome, yet they must algates of necessitie passe
through the Countrey of the Turkes, when so euer
they would go to Mecca. But the reason thereof was
because Amurath had concluded a peace with the
Persians, without making them acquainted therewithall,
and to the exceeding great detriment of
their designements and affaires.
            And in sooth euen as true is it,The difference and quarrell betweene Alip Chan, and his brother Hirach that the Tartarians
did forbeare to come to the Turks in so great a
multitude as they expected, because they were kept
backe by the Moscouite, although the Tartarians
themselues did vse it for an excuse: but the verie
truth is, that the Tartarian two brethren being become
great enemies, the one to the other. Alipe Chan
to maintaine himselfe in the state, and Hirach to
driue him out of it, they held all the Countrey in a
faction, and busied wholy in the defence of their
owne priuate quarels, as yet they doe. For Alipe
though he be the King now reigning, is not obeyed
by all the Tartarians: and Hirach is acknowledged
to be king, onely by such as haue serued him as generall
in this warre. Who although it is verie likely
that in the end hee will get the victorie, because the
Turkish Emperour Mahamet hath commaunded
them all to obey him, and acknowledge him for
their king, and the greatest part of the Souldiers doe
follow him: yet is the contrarie opinion holden by
such as haue the best intelligence of the Tartarian



affaires, not onely because euen among the Barbarians.
Ius Naturae, i. the right of Nature caryeth
a great stroke, but also because Hirach is lesse beloued,
more auaricious, and esteemed among them
to be a man of small braine and valour.
         
         
            § XXV.
            LAstly,The Turke feareth to be troubled by the Pope, and the king of Spaine. the Turke feareth that the Pope and the
king of Spaine are minded to trouble his state
and Countrey, both by sea and by land, and by that
meane to diuert him from his purposed designmēts.
But forasmuch as this may bee done by diuerse and
sundrie wayes, it will not be amisse in plaine and distinct
maner to tell you, what I thinke.Conditions requisite to be in such as should be sent to trouble the Turkish state. The Christian
princes, and especially the pope, may send diuerse
Agents into the Turkish Empire, who (that they
might haue the more credite) would be of the selfe
same Countreys, wherein such a trouble and insurrection
should be attempted. It were verie fit also
that they had the tongue, to the ende they might
both vnderstand, and be vnderstood: and lastly that
they be men of good cariage and iudgement: but
aboue all other thinges, that they haue conuenient
supplie of money, to spend vppon such chiefe men
and Captaines as are of greatest credite with the
people, and that they haue authoritie withal to promise
to such as are the mightiest among them,What pretense or colour they may vse. that
they shall be well rewarded and recompensed. Finally,
it shall bee verie needfull, that for their more
easie admittance and intertainment in the Country,
and not on a sodaine to be driuen away, they should



couer all their treaties with the couer of Religion,
not to couch the Snake vnder the grasse, as our
naughtie Polititians do, but (if so it may please the
Lord) among the thornes of their errours to sowe
the seede of Gods worde, making shew for the time
that they wil reforme and repaire the Churches that
are in Tartaria, Circassia, Bulgaria, Walacchia, Moldauia,
and Graecia.
            Moreouer the territorie of the Turkes,Howe the Turke may be ouerthrowen by his owne nation. and especially
that part which the Turkish Empire doth possesse
in Europe, inhabited partly by Turks Natural,
partly by Rinegados, and partly by Christians, the
Ottoman Prince may with great reason feare, that if
either his Armies shall receiue an ouerthrow, or
some of his principals be corrupted, his peoples wil
make an insurrection and tumult to his exceeding
great losse, yea, and peraduenture to his vtter ruine,
euen as Caesar wrought and effected against Iuba.
            But because the knowledge of these peoples is verie necessarie,
for the better vnderstanding of this point touching
these insurrections and rebellions, I will enlarge the
matter somewhat farther.
         
         
            § XXVI.
            THE Turkes naturall, that is to say,The naturall Turkes. those that be
Turkes of the auncient ofspring, although they
be by nature not of so euill a disposition and inclination,
as the other Rinegate Turkes are, yet bee they
as greatly discontented and displeased as the Rinegates
are: so that it will be no great matter for them
one day to make a rebellion, especially if they shall



find a Head, or a Captaine fit for the purpose.Why the naturall Turkes are discontented. The
occasion of their discontentments springeth from
hence, that they see all the militarie charges and offices,
whereon only the profite, commoditie, & honour
of that Empire doth chiefly depende, (as it is
before partly touched) are giuen and bestowed vpon
the rinegate Turkes, those few onely excepted,
which are graunted to some of the naturall Turkes
by exceeding great fauour, or to the children of the
Sultane-Ladies. And herevpon it commeth, that among
the Musulmani, there is no terme or title
more honourable,What the word Turke signifyeth. or more in request, then to be called
Schiauo del Gran Signore, the vassall or slaue of the
great Lord: nor any more infamous and more abhorred,
then the worde Turke: for Turke in their
tongue signifieth a villaine: as among the Greeks
Nomade doth not signifie onely a man of Numidia,
but a Sheepheard, and therfore Strabo calleth the
Scythians, Nomadi. And hereof likewise it is, as it
hath beene also obsetued by a late moderne writer,
that euen as the Italians doe in their Comedies
bring on the stage a Zani, which is a Bergamaske
slaue or villaine, so the Turks in their playes do bring
vp a Turke, that is to say, a rusticall or rude Clowne.
Others there are, which deriue the worde Turke
from the Hebrew, and wil haue it to signifie an Exul
or a banished man, for the selfe same reasons, for
which we told you before, that the Tartarians calthemselues
Reliquias, reliques.
            The rinegate Turkes, out of all question it is certaine,The Rinegados.
that when by the grace of God they shall feele
and vnderstand the benefite which they haue lost,



they will easily ouerturne that state vp-side downe,
with the totall and vtter ouerthrow of that Empire:
considering that they haue in their hands (as it hath
beene tolde you) all the reputation and riches,
which are the thinges whereon both Credite and
Obedience do necessarily depend. But for as much
as they are men of a most vitious and wicked nature,
and are tollerated in all kind of beastly insolences,
so that they dare doe any thing that them
listeth, they are willing and content to liue in that
infamous liberty, without attempting any innouation.
            The Christians,The Christians called by the Turkes Ghiauri. who by the Turkes are called
Ghiauri, that is to say, Gentiles and Infidels, euen in
regarde of the diuerse and sundry Rites that are among
them, especially in the Turkish Countrey,
(not knowing poore vnhappy soules, that there is
but one onely true Church, one Baptisme and one
true Faith) they are eyther of the Greeke Sect, or
of the Latine Rite. I doe not entend at this time
to discourse particularly of althose that haue strayed
from the purity of the Greeke sect, as the Georgians,
the Armenians,Georgians, Armenians, Aethiopians the Aethiopians, the Iacobites
and many others, that dwell (as I told you) in
the Ottoman Empire, aswell in Europe, as in Asia,
and Africa, both because it hath beene diligently &
curiously done by others, and also because it is a
very intricate and difficult matter, by reason of their
differences in opinions, and distances of Countryes,
and for many other respectes, to bring them to
conspire together in one, (without the great miracle
of GOD,) for the subuersion and ruine of that



Empire.Heretikes. I ouerpasse also the Heretikes that are among
them, for that although they doe remaine in
the Ottoman State, eyther as Reliques of their ancient
Forefathers, or else of late retyred into diuerse
partes of that Countrey, to liue the more licentiously,
or like the Sonnes of Sathan, to disperse
their poyson euen among the Turkes: yet being so
greatly abhorred of them,Sultan Soliman to the Widdowe Queene of Transyluania. as disturbers of the publike
peace and tranquilitie (as Sultan Soliman wrote
to the Queene Dowager of Transyluania.) They
cannot bee permitted to make any great trayne, or
worke any innouation among the people. I wil onely
speake of those Greekes, which serue best for this
our purpose, not regarding them for this time touching
their Religion, but considering them for so
much as in policie may bee expected and hoped
for at their handes, in this particular point of rebellion
and insurrection.Greekes. The Greekes without al
doubt, are by a certaine pricke and eagre desire to
dominere and rule, which they haue had by nature
most desirous of Nouelties: and because the Turks
doe so greatly tyrannize ouer them, they doe
willingly and readily embrace any alteration or
tumult, hoping by that onely meane to shake
off the heauie yoke of their most miserable slauerie.
And this is chiefly and especially desired by the
Greekes of Morea and of Thessalie, and by those
rather which dwell towardes the sea, because forraine
aides and helpes may more easily bee supplyed
to them, then to those that dwell within the
land. But farre aboue all others, it is most desired
by the Seruiani, being a Nation that inhabiteth



in the mountaines of Albania, euen to the Danow: among
whom those that are in Dardania, and most
neare vnto the saide Mountaines, are best able to
make the greatest stirres. And they be the Piperi, the
Cucci, the Clementi, the Bellopauligi, and others in the
Countrey of Plaua, and among them there are many
Albanians that liue after the Romish rite. And
these be they, that because they haue a strong site for
dwelling, and are by nature verie fierce and hardie,
haue not as yet suffered themselues to bee subdued
by the Turkish forces. And therefore they did (at
the last) attempt to withdraw themselues out of the
Ottoman tyrannie.Rebellion of the Greekes in Plaua vnder Gardan Vaiuode. For hauing vnderstood that Mahamet
was discomfited and slaine in the battaile at
Agria, they all arose in a tumult vnder the commaund
of Gardan Vaiuode, and made a great slaughter
of the Turkes that were in their Countrey: but
when they were minded to passe further, they vnderstood
the contrarie, and so in a discontented maner
retired themselues into their mountaines.
            And for as much as these poore miserable Greeks
haue endured so seuere chastisement at the handes
of the Turkish officers, that they remaine not onely
most pitifully afraied, but also most grieuously oppressed,
their chiefe heades and gouernours being
cruelly put to death, their children taken from their
parents, some killed and slaughtered, and almost all
of them bereaued and spoyled of that little which
they had, and brought to extreame miserie: a man
may verie plainely and clearly see and know that to
be most true,Iohn Botero Antonio Bruni. which is written by Iohn Botero in his
Africa, and more at large by Antonio Bruni in his



treatise of the Beglerbey-ship of Graecia,Caution to be obserued in rebellion. that is to say,
That it is not good to attempt such enterprises and
insurrections, but with a strong resolution, and forces
sufficient to bring the intended purpose to passe.
For otherwise they waken and arme the enemie,
and serue to none other end, but to worke losse to
the Authours of them, and to themselues that are in
the action: and so much the rather because such rebellions
(for the most part) are not throughly considered
of,Why the Turk tooke Bernegasso from Prete Iani. nor well aduised, nor raised in fit time &
oportunitie. And that this is true, it may bee perceiued
& known by that which the Turke did, whē he
vnderstood that the Armadaes of the Portugals had
oftentimes entered into the redde sea, and were
there entertained by the Officers of Prestre-Ian, and
that they also gaue ayde to the Portugals agaynst
him. For thereupon he tooke away from Prete-Ian
almost all the Prouince of Bernagasso, and made the
Arabians to fortifie their hauens, which alwayes before
were wont to be open and common.
            Moreouer, the Chimeriotes, of whom I haue spoken
somewhat alreadie,Rebellion of the Chimeriotres. hauing lately made a rebellion,
by some perswasions giuen vnto them (and specially
by the meanes and helpe of Athanasius Bishop
of Ocrida, who made them beleeue that hee had
intelligence with the Emperour,Athanasius B. of Ocrida. and that he expected
aydes from the king of Spaine) were enforced
to reconcile themselues to the Turkes, as diuerse other
times they had done before, with such conditions
as were of great disaduantage vnto them: which
likewise (to leaue now al older examples) happened
in our dayes to the Ducati their neighbours, who



after they were well chastised by Pirri Bassa,Pirri Bassa. then
being the Sangiack of Deluino, and brought not to
many mo then two hundred housholds, were transported
to Neriho.
            Lastly,The taking of Clissa. the taking of Clissa (to leaue those of Corone,
of Castle Nuouo in the time of Charles the fift,
and others) which fell out now last of all, hath not
wrought that benefite and profite, which was highly
desired by the popes holy minde: and principally
because the Murlacchi, by whom the imperialists
did verily beleeue they shoulde haue beene ayded
against the Turke,Why the Murlacchi went against Lencouich. perceiuing so small a number of
them to come, quite contrarie to their hope and expectation,
because they would not make their estate
worse with a greater affliction & punishment, came
downe from the mountaines and fought on the
Turkes side, who did helpe them to defeate Lencouich,
telling him plainly that they would be true and
faithfull to the grand-Turke.
            But returning to those peoples, that dwell in the
Turkish Country,The Latines The forren Latines. it remaineth now to speake of the
Latines. Some of them dwell there as forreiners and
straungers, and some make their continuall abode
there. The forreiners attend and employ themselues
vpon trades and trafficke, either by themselues, or
by others for them: and little harme can they doe,
hauing neither a Head or Captaine to guide them,
nor weapons sufficient to fight withal, especially being
in number so few, and dispersed scattringly here
and there ouer all that state. Some there be that making
these Latines to bee all one with other Christians,
that are of a seuerall sect, do hold opinion, that



they which dwell in Constantinople, by conspiring togither,
vpon any occasion of some notable tumult
and vprore raised by the Turks thēselues, may make
some stirre not vnworthie of good consideration.
For they do think, that the Latines being (indeed)
of greater number in Constantinople, then in the other
most populous Cities of that Empire, such as are
Cairo, Aleppo, and Tauris, adding Pera therevnto,
where all the Latines almost do remaine, those few
Caffaluchi excepted,The Caffaluluchi. which keep in Constantinople
after they were transported thither from Caffa by
Mahamet, they may the more easily confederate
themselues togither, and be prouided and furnished
with armour, whereof the Turkes are wont most
strictly to spoyle the Christians in other places,
therby the more to strengthen and secure their own
estates.Why Amurath meant to put to death certaine Christians of Constantinople, & yet did not. And hereupon Amurath the last, hauing accused
the Christians that they had set on fire certain
streetes in Constantinople (euen like for all the worlde
as Nero did, when hee accused the Christians that
were in Rome in his time of the like crime) & therfore
had giuen order, that the Iannizaries should hew
them in peeces, he reuoked that commaundement,
when he was aduertised by the Aga, that in regarde
of their multitude it could not bee put in execution
without great daunger: besides that it would breed
an exceeding notable losse of his customs, and greatly
disturbe the trafficke which would bee a thing against
reason, and the law of all nations: and therefore
he caused diuerse Iewish women to be put to
death, that had counsailed and aduised him therevnto.
            

               
Others are of opinion,The meanes to raise ciuill warres among the Turkes. that some persons might
bee vsed without any suspition of the Turkes, who
vnder the colour and by occasion of traffique, in the
Ottomans Dominions, and speciallie in Constantinople,
might eyther by large bribes, or by soothing
and fostering the ambition or discontentmentes of
the chiefest great men, ouerthrow that Empire
with a ciuill warre, and the rather for that their
Prince is a man of small witte or forecast: as peraduenture
it had fallen out, if wee Christians had
furthered the discontentmentes and iealousies of
Ferat,Iars betweene the Great men of Turkie. of Hibraim, of Pirri, and of Mustafa, and of
Mahamet Bassa, and lastly of Sinan and of Ferat, and
those iarres that are not yet appeased betweene Cicala
and Hibraim. And this matter might the
more safely bee brought to passe, if any occasion
should fall out, that diuerse Brethren should meete
in pretense and challenge of the Empire, as it happened
among the Children of Mahamet, of Baiazet,
and of Soliman: or if the Empire should chance to
want a Naturall Successor.
            And forasmuch as the will of Man,That the Turkish estate may be ouerturned rather by learning then by Force. may bee
wonne and bowed two manner of wayes, that is to
say, eyther by force or by reason: Some thinke
that the Turkish State may bee ouerturned not only
by such meanes as are aboue mentioned, but also
by discouering vnto the Turkes, and particulatly
vnto the Ianizzaries, on the one side their
birth and ofspring, and the Baptisme which they
haue had, and on the other side the fables and mad
fooleries of the Alcoran, which are verie learnedly
declared by Cardinall Cusanus, and other writers



But the more auaileable course would bee,Iohn Andrea Alfacqui of Sciatiua. to make
some easie and witty bookes of this matter in the
Sclauoyne tongue, and in the Arabike, as in particular
hath beene alreadie done by Iohn Andrea,Bookes to bee dispersed in Turkie, to aduertise the Turks of their errors. somtimes
a Moore, and Alfacqui, of the Cittie of Sciatiua:
and the bookes of the one language to bee dispersed
and scattered in Europe, and the other in Asia,
causing them to passe from the Indies, to Mozambique
in Africa, and from thence to Zofala &
Quiloa which are in Asia: Or to the Moluccoes, to
Gouien, Goa, Diu, Ormuz and other places where the
Turkish merchantes doe haunt and frequent: or els
to Oran, to Arzide, and to other places subiect to the
King of Spaine: or lastly thorough the Countryes
of the Gentiles and Heathen, that are in amity and
confederacie with the Christians, as Calicut, Zeilam,
Cambaia and others, and ouer all the partes of Europe,
that confine and border vppon the Turkes.
which course in mine opinion, although it will not
peraduenture worke that which such like bookes
doe vsually worke among vs Christians, being sowen
and scattered abroade for the most part by men,
that are desirous of Nouelties, especially for that the
Turkes are as farre from employing themselues in
reading and studie, as wee are too much addicted
thereunto, and curious therein: yet notwithstanding,
it may peraduenture one day worke some
great good, if some Great man among them should
become the Head of a new sect:The Sophilarii. for thereby it
may easily come to passe, that hee should bee followed
by the multitude, as it hath happened in
Germanie, in England, and in France, and oftentimes



among the Turkes themselues in Africa, where learning
flourished for a long time,Erdeuil. and in Persia among
the Sophilarii, who are the followers of the Sect of
Hali, one of the fower companions of the seducer
Mahamet, which sect was afterward rather renewed
then inuented by Erdeuil, whome Paulus Iouius
calleth Arduel the Father of Ismael the Sophi.
            And here I cannot but vpon this occasion recount
vnto yon a matter most worthie to be recorded
in Historie,A notable hystorie of the Confession & death of a youth of the Serraglio. that happened in the life time of
the last Emperour Amurath at Constantinople. And
thus it was. That one of those youthes which are
brought vp in the Royal Serraglio, hauing leasure &
conueniencie to reade the Holy Bible, and therevpon
by the mediation and working of the grace of
God, being brought to the knowledge of his error
wherein hee liued, caused himselfe to be carried into
the Presence of the Great Turke, and there with
a Christian courage and boldnesse told him, That if
he would preserue his soule from the eternall fire
and damnation, hee must surcease from following
that impious superstition of Mahamet, and humble
himselfe vnder the obedience of the true law of Iesus
Christ the Sauiour and Redeemer of the whole
world. But hee was for the same, as though he had
committed a most heynous and grieuous offence,
condemned publikely to bee spitted aliue vppon a
stake, where hee iterated and repeated the same
words to all the people, with such effectuall termes
replenished and enflamed with the fiery spirite of
the holy Ghost, that many of the beholders feeling
themselues inwardly inkindled therewith, did burst



foorth in commiseration of his death, into verie
disdainefull and despitefull speeches against Amurath:
and if the tumulte had not beene appeased
at the first, by the Praetorian Bandes, certainelie
there had followed thereupon a most daungerous
and perilous sedition.
            So that in truth,Commendation of the D. of Florence for printing in the Arabike tong. the Great Duke of Tuscane,
deserueth exceeding prayse and commendation, for
causing many good and godly workes to bee imprinted
in the Arabike Character or Letter, of

in Africa, and else where. A course out of all question,
that although it was heretofore disturbed
and hindered by the Siriffe of Africa, vpon the insinuation
of Antonio di Flores, a Neapolitane, yet
one day perhappes may bee so happily promoted
and furthered, as it will bring foorth that fruit which
was affected & desired by Pope Gregorie the XIII.
a man in that respect worthie of euerlasting memorie,
and is also at this time greatly endeauored by
the Pope that now liueth.
            But forasmuch as the greatest part of those Christians,
which doe continuallie dwell and remayne within
the Turkish dominions, are Albanois, I will somewhat
insist vpon telling you somewhat of them.
         
         
            § XXVII.
            SOme of these Albanois or Albanians do liue according
to the Latine rite,The Albanians others after the Greekish
rite: but all of them dwell not onely in that
part which is called Albania, beginning on the west



at Dulcigno, and the lake of Scutari,Their habitation. and ending on
the East at Bastia, which I tolde you was right ouer
against the Island of Corfu: but also in other places
of Morea, and of Grecia, where they haue withdrawne
themselues eyther by occasion of the wars,
or beene transported thether by the Emperours of
the East, thereby to remedy their often rebellions.
Touching these Albanois Latines,Their Conditions. the same Bruni
their Countryman in his Treatise before alleadged
doth write, that as they are the best armed people
so are they the most true and faithfull Christians in
all the Ottoman Empire, holden also to be the most
valiant and greatliest feared for their continuall insurrections,
raysing trouble and tumult vpon any
the least occasion that they can catch: and this is
the qualitie both of those that dwell in the playne
Countrey, and also of those that keepe in the mountaines.
Howbeit they are constrayned in despite
of their teeth to submit and humble themselues,Their weakenes.
because they are not able alone and of themselues
to resist the Turkes, and much lesse their neighbour
Christians, by whome they are verie many times
more vexed and troubled for their rapine and spoyling
of Christians, then for fayning themselues to
be faithfull towardes the Turke. Besides that oftentimes
the Sangiackes doe minister good cause
vnto them to rebell, eyther because they vse to praye
vpon them, or for that they would be reuenged on
them, or else that they might haue a likely excuse for
not going abroad to any warre a farre off.The Sangiacks of the Ducagini. And for
the same purpose the Sangiack of the Ducagini doth
neuer depart from thence, like as also he of Castell-Angelo



doth,The Sangiack of Castel-Angelo. who vnder the colour and pretense
of defending that Countrey from the Christian
Armadaes, stayeth alwayes at home.
            These Ducagini do dwell in the mountain Scardo,The Ducagini.
at the confines of Preseremo, called in times past
Parrecopoli, or Perenopoli which is in Dardania vpon
the borders of Albania, inhabited more by the Albanois,
then by the Seruians:Preseremo is not Iustendili. neyther is it that
which is called Iustendil, as some doe think: for the
one Cittie is distant from the other by the space of
three dayes iourneyes, and yet they bee in one and
the selfe same Prouince.Iustendil is not Instiniana the first. They are are also greatlie
deceyued in my iudgement, which are of opinion,
that Iustendil is Iustiniana the first, and not the second,
and that Preseremo or Iustendil, was the naturall
Countrey of Iustinian the Emperour, and not
O crida, which is in truth Iustiniana the first, and
was called in the old time Lycbindo. Those that do
dwell somewhat farre off out of the common highway,
doe pay no tribute, because they are defended
by the rough and craggie passage of their mountaine
scituation. The mountaine is called Nero,
Blacke, and so are many mountaines in Turkie, called
likewise by the same name.Albania described.
            
            This Albania at the Adriatike Sea is compassed
about by verie high mountaines. A plaine countrey
it is, and watered with many very great riuers, so
that they debarre passage for footmen to trauell to
those Christians that inhabite the other partes of the
Countrey. They haue no Horse, neyther haue they
any meanes to make Bridges. Those places that
are inward and inclosed within the waters are in



the possession of the Turkes: and although they
be not all garded with Garrisons, nor strongly kepte,
yet the principall of them are verie safe,Antonio Brun so that they
cannot couertly bee robbed or spoyled by the Christians:
which point (sayeth the said Bruni) I thought
good to note vnto you, in regarde of the opinion,
which is, conceiued of these peoples, that they are
able of themselues to performe soome good, without
the helpe and succours of any forraine Nation:
and that the fame and rumor onely of the aides
that should come from Italie and Spain, with a shew
likewise but of one Regiment vnder an Ensigne, (euen
as the Embassadour of Lewes Duke of Myllane,Lewes D. of Milan. Charles the VIII. K. of France.
told Charles the VIII. King of France,) is sufficient
and enough to stirre them vppe to an insurrection.
But God graunt that the vnhappy wretches be not
brought into daunger hereby, and that by these open
and publike treaties, there bee no losse indeed
of the oportunity of some good, that may be expected
in times to come.
            And thus much bee spoken of the Turkes naturall,
and of the Rinegadoes, and of the Grecians and Latines,
that dwell in the Turkes dominions.
         
         
            § XXVIII.
            AND lastly the Turke considereth,The Turke feareth the ioyning of the Popes Gallyes with the Spanish Gallyes. that if the
Gallyes of the king of Spaine, that is to say, the
Guardes of Naples, Sicilie and Genoa, should ioyne
themselues with the Gallyes of the Pope, of Malta,
of Florence, and of Sauoy, they would make so good
a bodie of an Armada, that being assisted by fauourable



winds, they may very easily on a suddaine assault,
either Castle-Nuouo, or the Velona, and other
places of Albania: or else if they forbeare so to doe
in regard of the Common-wealth of Venice, who
chalengeth iurisdiction in the Adriatical sea, for such
reasons as are at large displayed by Girolamo Bardi,
they may assaile Morea, and perhaps also the Dardanelli,
or some other notable place of his Empire to
his exceeding losse.
            Which poynt being verie considerable and of good consequence,How the places possessed by the Turkes on the seacoast may be assaulted.
it will not be amisse, for the better information of
such, as shall courteonsly reade all these discourses, aud doe
not so well know the particulars of those places which belong
to the Turke, and may by vs Christians be easily assaulted,
that I tell you somewhat in particularitie, and specially
touching their situation, and the manner of winning
them, whether it be likely to proue well or no.
            Castle-Nuouo is within the Chanell of Catharo
called in olde times the auncient Ascriuius.Castel-Nouo. The entrance
therevnto is verie hard and difficult, by reason
of the straites in the mouth of it, where Iacomo
Soranzo the general Proueditorie for the Venetian
Armada,The Fort of Varbagno defaced by Iacomo Soranzo had made the fort of Verbagno euen with
the ground, which was there built by the Turkes.
To get that place, the spade may worke much, but
it may easily be succoured by land. It was somtimes
possessed by the Spaniards, who although they did
not maintaine and keepe it against Barbarosso, for the
reasons that are most manifest, and knowne, yet are
they greatly commended by the Turkes in their
Chronicles.
            Velona, called in times past Aulon, is situate at the



mouth of the gulf of the Sea Adriatike,Velona▪ The Promontorie of Santa Maria. ouer against
the promontorie of Santa Maria, in old time called
Iapygia, in Pulia, not aboue threescore miles from Otranto.
This place hath no conuenient Port or Hauen
for the Gallies, but some three miles off: the entrance
thereof, being well defended, and barred with
marishes, with Pooles and Saltpits. It is not verie
strong, and yet if you should be minded to conquer
it, you must batter two Castels, the one, which is in
the plaines and almost conioyned with the Burgo,
and built in times past by the aduise of Pignatello an
Out-law of Naples:Pignatello an Out-law of Naples. and the other, which standeth
aloft, lesse then a mile distant from the Citie, and is
called Canina, now inhabited by the Turkes, who
had driuen the Christians from thence, vpon a suspition,
that they had taken of them in this present
treatise of reuolt.
            Touching the rest of Albania or Arbania,Why the Armenians cannot doe that which they did in times past. the
places which may bee gotten, are within land, and
those that are on the sea-coasts haue no Hauens. Besides
that the Inhabitants are for the most part verie
base and cowardly people. And although the time
was indeed, wherein the Albanois did shew themselues
verie valiant against the Turkes, and specially
in the dayes of George Castriotte, yet now they cannot
shew themselues to be the same men,George Castriotta. because they
haue their enemie not onely their absolute Lord
and Maister at home in their houses, but they haue
him also on their backes, as in tymes past they
had not: to which calamitie they haue been
subiect, euer since the Turke hath gained their
Countrey, and the Countrie adioyning vnto them.



Moreouer, the Albanois are greatly diminished, and
want such a couragious Captaine as Castriotte was,
who had good intelligence of the Turkish affaires,
well experienced in the Countrey and highly beloued
and admired of the Countrey inhabitants, and
also of his souldiers.
            Dulcigno,Dulcigno▪ called heretofore Olcinio, or Colchinio,
may be assailed by an Armada. For although it want
a Hauen, yet in good weather the Fleete may disbarke
vpon the shore. It is by situation verie strong,
but a great part of it is fallen by an earthquake: and
therefore if it should be wonne, it wil be most needfull
for the maintaining and keeping of it, to fortifie
it anew.Scutari. If Dulcigno be wonne, Scutari, in times past
called Scodra, may peraduenture be woone also. For
although it bee fortified in a situation that is by Nature
most strong, yet is it so ill guarded by the
Turkes as it may easily bee entred in the night time
vpon a sodaine.
            Durazzo,Durazzo. of old called Dyrracchium lieth in the
plaine Countrey. It is not strong, but in trueth it
would be the aptest and fittest of all other places
to make entrance into the enemies Countrey, bee
cause it is situate in the middle, and neare vnto Italy,
although it bee very subiect to the expectation and
feate of the enemies assaults.
            The Turke may also be greatly damnified,Morea. by entering
in Peloponesus, which is at this day called Morea,
either for the many Mulberie trees which are
there, or because it hath the shape or forme of a
Mulberie leafe. This prouince lying in the midst of
the states, which the Turke hath in Europe, if it



were entred,The true way how to warre with the Turk wee should make warre with him at
home within his owne Countrey: which is indeed
the true Art of warfare: for so did Cyrus, Caesar, and
Hanniball, and so haue the most famous auncient
Captaines aduised to do, whatsoeuer other moderne
men of later times do say to the cōtrarie. Moreouer,
by this meanes he should easily be diuerted and turned
away indeed, and his Armada hindred from going
any further.
            Lastly,Salonicchi. if Salonicchi, sometimes called Thessalonica
might be gotten, it is most certaine that it would be
verie auailable for the forwarning of our affaires.
For our people and Souldiers being disbarked at
that place, they may afterwardes very conueniently
and commodiously passe vnto such places as lie vpon
the high way which leadeth to Constantinople,
and cut out a way into Greece, as did the Romanes,
and Alaricus king of the Gotthes,Alaricus king of the Gotthes who with thirtie
thousand men onely, subdued and conquered the
Romanes themselues. And so much the easier will
it be, if at the verie selfe same time the Polack and
the Transyluanian be pricked forwarde to passe ouer
the Danow, and so going on through Bulgaria,
to annoy the enemie in earnest, euen to the Citie
of Constantinople.
         
         
            § XXIX.
            BVt most true it is,Aduertisemēt how to bring their matters to passe. that it will be verie necessarie
for the safe and sure effecting of these other like
resolutions, if our Princes shall happen to bee resolued
to put them in execution in deed, that they vse
the greatest secrecie that may be.Secree. One thing (sayeth
Haytho the Armenian, writing vpō the iourny to the



Holy Land,) among others. I dare bee bolde to
put you in mind of that in any case,Haytho the Armenian as soone as the
Christians shall bee resolued to doe any good, they
doo warily and curiously keepe secret their intents
and counsels, to the end that the enemie be in no
wise informed or acquainted with their purposes.
For the Christians in times by-past, because they
would not conceale their designementes, found by
experience, that they fell into many disaduantages,
whereas on the contrarie side, the enemie hath auoided
many daungers, and so bereaued the Christians
of their opportunities, to bring their wished
desires to effect. To leaue the examples of the
Gentiles, when Iudith was resolued with a couragious
minde to goe and kill Holofernes, for the deliuerie
of the Cittie of Bethulia, it is written in the
Holy Scripture, that shee would not make any partaker
of her purpose, but sayde to two onelie,Iudith. cap. 8 and
afterwardes to the Priestes: Vos nolo vt scrutemini
actum meum, & vsque dum renuntiem vobis, nihil aliud
fiat, nisi oratio pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum:
I will not haue you to enquire of my Act, and vntill
I declare it vnto you, Let no other thing be done,
but prayer for mee to the Lorde our God. This
course if it were practised in our times with true deuotion
and Faith, certainely it would not fall out,
that our Princes should haue any neede at all to
feare a happy and prosperous issue of their counsels
and deuises, and thereby they might also more
curiously search and find out the designementes of
their enemies. For euen as God doth neuer abandon
or forsake those, that with pure zeale do fight



for his most holy name, so dooth hee well know,
how to find good and conuenient meanes for the
discouerie of all the secrets of his enemies vnto the
true ministers of his Holie will, as hee did to Elizeus,Elizeus. 4. King. 6. cap.
when hee disclosed vnto him the Counsels of
the King of Syria, although hee vsed all the care
and cunning that hee had to conceale them from
him.Knowledge of the Countrey. Knights of Malta.
            
            Moreouer it would bee also necessarie to haue
such persons in the Armada, as are verie expert in
the knowledge of the Countryes, least it happen
to them, as it happened to the Knightes of Malta,
who fayled in the surprise of Modone, because they
did not know at the first that there was a Bridge
to bee passed ouer, presently after they had made
their first entrance.
            It were likewise very fitte and conuenient,Languages, Iudgement, Credite. Vnderstanding and desire to praise God.
that the saide persons (as I haue told you alreadie)
should haue the language, a sound iudgement, good
credite, and quicke vnderstanding, but especially,
and aboue all, that they haue a desire to doe good
to Christendome. Qualities (no doubt) that
are to bee found in plentifull manner in some that
liue at this day, and would be verie apt and meet
instrumentes to bring greate enterprises to good
passe, if our Princes by their good seruice and
meanes would resolue themselues to doe it in deed
as did Pope Iuly the II, by the helpe of Constantine
Cominianus, and Pope Pius the V. who called
Fryer Gasper Bruni, the commendatorie of Ierusalem
from Dulcigno, of purpose to vse him in the
Armada against the Turke and other matters of moment



appertaining to that warre.Why Princes do oftentimes entertaine the opinions of such as know least. But the mischiefe
is, that for the most part our Princes doe giue credite
to such persons, as neither know nor vnderstand
the mysterie and Art of warrefare, either because
those places are carried away by fauour, yea
and verie oftentimes disposed vpon those that vnderstand
least: or because they make a promise to
performe the enterprise with lesse charges and expenses
then others will doe: or by flatterie, or by
ambition, or rather (as I thinke) to make a gaine
thereof: wherevpon there ariseth great losse and
shame, both to the Princes themselues, and to the
Promoters and furtherers of such goodly instruments.
         
         
            § XXX.
            TO be briefe, the Turke is afraid, least the Armada
of Spaine,The Turke feareth the assaulting of the Dardanelli. or any other fleete of ships might
depart in Iune with some North-westernly windes,
not to goe (as it went the last yeare to sacke Patarasse)
or into Alexandria (as it thought to haue
done long ago) or into Africa (as peraduenture it
will be no difficult matter for the Spanish Armada
to doe) or lastly to endomage and annoy some other
place both within and without the Adriatike
Sea, which I will not name, because I will not discouer
or disclose that which is not so well knowne in
Hystories, as some other things also are (that I haue
touched) and which peraduenture may one day be
happely attempted: but to goe, and vpon a sodaine
to assault the Dardanelli, called in auncient times



Sestus and Abydo, which are (as it were) the forewals
and the first hate of entrance into his pallace, and
Mahamet the second fortified them as soone as hee
had gotten Constantinople. And so much the rather,
for that if they haue the said windes fauourable, the
voyage will be but of a fewe dayes iourney: and by
sayling to the Gulfe Lanciato, the passage will be also
more safe from the enemies Armada. For although
our Armada should bee perceiued by the
Turkes that keepe on the sea coasts, yet would they
thinke that it were the Turkish fleete. And therefore
it will bee verie needfull for those that desire to attempt
this enterprise, that they would remember,
not to put this deuise in execution, vntill such time
as they shall know for a certaintie, that the enemies
Armada is gone forth.By taking the Dardanelli the entrance into Turkie will be easie.
            
            And yet I do not say, that when the Dardanelli are
surprised & taken, Constantinople will presently be gotten,
as some haue written: but this I say, that it wil
put that Citie in such a fright, as it will be no great
matter, if any tumult be raised to make the entrance
into it, verie easie of it selfe and open, especially if
they shall haue before hand entertained some intelligence
within the Citie, or that the Turke shall
haue receiued some notable ouerthrow, eyther by
land or Sea.The distance of the Dardanelli, the one from the other: and from Gallipolis, and from Constantinople,
            
            The Dardanelli, that is on Europes side, hath a
hil that doth wholy commaund it. The other which
is in Natolia, or Asia, as they call it, lieth in the plaine.
They are both easie to be gotten, because they are
built after the olde maner. Against that which standeth
in Asia, the Abbay may also bee vsed, and so by



making great hilles of sand (for it is built vpon the
shore) it may be vndermined, as the Turkes vse to
doe. They are in breadth distant the one from the
other more then a mile: and in length from Gallipoli,
thirtie myles, and from Constantinople about a hundred
and threescore.
         
         
            § XXXI.
            THere are likewise many other wayes,How the Polonians, Hungarians, and Trausyluanians may make outroades into the Turkish territories by diuerse waies▪ whereby
the Polonians, the Hungarians, and the Transiluanians
may attempt also by land with diuerse
outrodes in the time of Haruest to gaine vpon the
Turke some place of good moment, and so enter
within the enemies Countrey, by some way which
they would little dreame off, and specially by keeping
themselues towardes the Sea, to the end they
may be succoured by our Armadaes, if need should
be.The Taifali, what they are, For so we reade, that heretofore fiue hundred
Taifali alone (as Zozimenus writeth) which now are
the Transyluanians, and Walachians, made an incursion
vnder Constantine, euen as farre as Constantinople,
to the exceeding affrightment and terrour
of the inhabitants of that Cittie.The wayes which the Turke chiefly feareth. The wayes,
whereof the Turkes are most afrayed, are those of
Sophia, of Andrinopolis, of Philippo-polis, and of those
quarters.
            But to the ende that our Princes may bee assured,The reading of hystories in this point verie auailable.
how after their departure from Italie, they
may enter a great way within the Ottomans Countrey,
and passe euen to Constantinople it selfe, let them
reade the voyages of Constantine and Licinius, of



Constantius and Magnentius, of Iulian and Theodosius,
of Eugenius, of Arbogastes, of Theodoricus king of the
Gotthes, of Odoacre king of the Heruli, of Alaricus
king also of the Gotthes, & of Attila, of whō I haue
before made mention. And lastly let them very well
consider, of the purposes and deuises that Mithridates
had to come into Italie, when he departed from
Pontus, and Scythia, that is to say, from Circassia and
Tartaria: The Designements of Philip king of Macedonie
to passe into the Adriatike sea. The disbarking
and landing of the Romanes vpon the Macedonians,
and the returne which the Captaines of
Vespasian, of Antonie the first, and of Mutianus made
into Italy out of Soria, and also the iourney of Boemond,
and others, when they went to the conquest
of the holy land, and other such like voyages, that
may be collected out of Histories.
         
         
            § XXXII.
            FInally, I will set downe for the last poynt,The consultation of Pope Leo the tenth, about the attempt of making warre against the Turke. as it
were for a Conclusion or Epilogue, of so much
as hath beene spoken, what Francis Guicciardin writeth
of Pope Leo the tenth, when he greatly feared,
that Selim would haue passed into Italie, not vnlike
to that which other Popes haue done, as P. Iouius
writeth in his counsell giuen for the warre against
the Turke, and sundry other Authours likewise. The
Pope (saith Guicciardin) like an vniuersall father,Frances Guicciardin. bethinking
himselfe of the Common good of Christendome,
after hee had first caused verie deuout
prayers and supplications to bee celebrated to God,



whereunto hee went himselfe bare-foot: he sent
writtes or Brieffes to all the Princes Christian,
warning them of the great daunger that was imminent
and at hand, and comfortably exhorted
them, that laying aside all discordes and contentions,
they would readilie attend vpon the defence
of religion, and their owne common safety, by vniting
their mindes and their Forces against the
Turke, and by going to assault him, euen at his own
home: Hee published vniuersall and generall
truces betweene the said Princes, with the punishment
of the heauiest censures of the Church to be
inflicted vppon such as gainesaide the same, to the
end, that onely such matters as belonged to so
great an enterprise, should bee entertayned and
handled. He dispatched vnto them for the same
purpose diuerse Legate-Cardinals, men of great authoritie,
and renowned aswell for their experience
in this businesse, as also for their opinion of learning.
He aduised and consulted with the Embassadors
of euery Prince, and examined the seuerall
conceites and iudgementes of militarie
men, and of such persons as were well acquainted
with the Countryes, with the disposition of the
Prouinces, and with the Forces and Armes of that
Empire. Last of all hee resolued with himselfe,
that it was most necessarie to prouide a very great
summe of Moneyes, partly by a contribution voluntarie
to bee made among the saide Princes, and
partly by an vniuersall Imposition to bee leuied
vpon all Christian Nations: and therevpon the
Emperour accompanied with the Hungarian and



Polonian Horsemen (who are verie warlike Nations,
and well exercised with continuall warres against
the Turkes) and with such an armie of Dutch
Horse and Foote, as were requisite for so great an
Enterprise; to sayle by the Danowe into Bossina:
(hee would say into Seruia, for so was the vpper
Mysia called in auncient times) and so to goe from
thence into Thracia, & approching neare vnto Constantinople,
the verie seate of the Empire of the Ottoman:
Secondly, that the king of France with all
the Forces of his owne kingdome, of the Venetians
and of other Princes of Italie, accompanied with the
Footemen of the Swizzers, should passe from the
Hauen of Brindes, (aunciently called Brundusium,)
into Albania (an easie and very short passage) to
assault Grecia, which is full of Christian inhabitants
who both in that respect, and in regarde of the
crueltie of the Turkish Empire, are very ready and
well disposed for a rebellion. Thirdly, that the
Kinges of Spaine, of Portugall, & of England should
ioyne their Armadaes together at Cartagena, and
at other Hauens thereaboutes, and so with CC.
shippes full of Spanish Footemen, and other souldiers,
addresse themselues to the Straites of Gallipoli,
of purpose to assault Constantinople it selfe, after
they had wonne the Dardanelli, otherwise called
the two Castles, situate in the mouth of the saide
Streytes. In the which iourney the Pope himselfe
would sayle likewise, taking shippe at Ancona with
C. Beaked shippes (hee would say Gallyes) in
his Companie. So that the State and Empire
of the Turkes being assaulted both by land and by



Sea, on all sides, with these preparations, (especially
for that the Turkes doe principally build vpon this
foundation, to defend themselues in the open field:)
it were likely (chiefly by Gods helpe and assistance)
that a happie end might be expected and atchieued
of so pitifull and lamentable a warre.
         
         
            § XXXIII.
            I Would to God it might please his Maiestie, that
euen as the vniting togither of all the Princes
Christian agaynst the Turke,ours either by a proportionable
contributing to the expenses of so vniuersall
and holie an association,
                  
                or else euerie one of them
by himselfe (I speak of such as are more conueniently
able to do it then the rest) by setting vpon the
enemie all at one time, as this (I say) is thought to
bee a matter in the eye and iudgement of man,
surely not altogither impossible, but in deed verie
hard and difficult, especially in these dayes, for the
sinnes of the world, which require wrath and calamitie:
So hee would vouchsafe with the eie of his
iustice to looke vpon the Ottoman, that he bee no
longer the rodde and scourge of his Diuine furie
against vs, but like an vnprofitable wretch, and
proude Colossus, he may at the last bee broken into
verie small peeces, by the stone of his Diuine
power: or at the least, with the eye of his mercie,
to beholde the Christian Princes, and to enspire
into their heartes a minde and desire to binde
themselues togither in one, with the bond of true
Charitie, euen as there is but one faith which they



professe, and one Church wherein all true beleeuers
do liue, (and therfore is called a cōgregation:)
to the end that leauing those subtill cōsiderations of
their priuate interests and commodities, either in regard
that their states are verie neer vnto the enemie,
or in respect of the power of some, and the weaknes
of others, or because the gaine and profite can not
be equall and alike to euerie man, without any greedinesse
of commaunding, and without ambition of
reigning, one in the East, another in the South, they
would vnite themselues, not (as it were) for cerimonie
& fashions sake, (for so Guicciardin himself saith)
as these matters and practises haue heretofore been
handled. But with effect, and in the zeale of true religion
and pietie, with the glorie of his diuine Maiestie,
and their owne saluation, against al the enemies
of his most holy name: Imitating therein,Godfrey of Boleine. that great
Godfrey of Boleine, not onely in resolution, but also, (if
need should so require) in alienating their owne
proper states & dominions, as he did with the dukedom
of Boleine, that so he might haue means to make
& maintaine war against the same tyrant: as many other
of those Lords did, that concurred in that holy
league, whereof we haue told you before. Wherevpon
it pleased the Lord of Hoasts, either for
our instruction, or for our shame and confusion,
so to work with them that they
recouered the holy Sepulchre,
and with verie great glorie
subdued all the East.
            FINIS.
