         THE VOYAGE ABOVT
the world, by Sir FRANCIS DRAKE.
         EVer since Almighty God commanded
Adam to subdue the earth, there haue
not wanted in all ages, some heroicall spirits,
which in obedience to that high mandate,
either from manifest reason alluring
them, or by secret instinct inforcing them
thereunto, haue expended their wealth,
imployed their times, and aduentured their
persons, to finde out the true circuit thereof.
         Of these, some haue endeauored to effect this their purpose,
by conclusion and consequence, drawne from the proportion
of the higher circles; to this nethermost globe, being the center
of the rest. Others not contented with schoole points. and such
demonstrations (for that a small errour in the beginning, groweth
in the progresse to a great inconuenience) haue added thereunto
their owne history and experience. All of them in reason
haue deserued great commendation of their owne ages, and
purchased a iust renowne with all posterity. For if a surueyer of
some few Lordships, whereof the bounds and limits were before
knowne, worthily deserue his reward, not onely for his trauell,
but for his skill also, in measuring the whole and euerie part
thereof: how much more, aboue comparison, are their famous
trauells by all meanes possible to be eternized, who haue bestowed
their studies and indeauor, to suruey and measure this globe
allmost vnmeasurable? Neither is here that difference to be obiected,

which in priuate possessions is of value: Whose Land suruey
you? forasmuch as the maine Ocean by right is the Lords alone,
and by nature left free, for all men to deale withall, as very sufficient
for all mens vse, and large enough for all mens industry.
         And therefore that valiant enterprise, accompanied with
happy successe, which that right rare and thrice worthy Captaine
Francis Drake atcheiued, in first turning vp a furrow about
the whole world, doth not onely ouermatch the ancient Argonautes,
but also outreacheth in many respects, that noble mariner
Magellanus and by farre surpasseth his crowned victory. But
hereof let posterity iudge.
         It shall, for the present, be deemed a sufficient discharge of duty,
to register the true and whole history of that his voyage, with
as great indifferency of affection as a history doth require, and
with the plaine euidence of truth, as it was left recorded by
some of the chiefe, and diuers other actors in that action.
         The said Captaine Francis Drake, hauing in a former voyage,
in the yeares 72. and 73. (the description whereof is already
imparted to the veiw of the world) had a sight, and onely a sight
of the south Atlantik, and thereupon either conceiuing a new, or
renewing a former desire, of sailing on the same, in an English
bottom; he so cherished thenceforward, this his noble desire
and resolution in himselfe, that notwithstanding he was hindered
for some yeares, partly be secret enuie at home, and partly
by publique seruice for his Prince and countrie abroad,
(wherof Ireland vnder Walter Earle of Essex giues honorable
testimonie) yet, against the yeare 1577. by gratious commission
from his soueraigne, and with the helpe of diuers friends aduenturers,
he had fitted himselfe with fiue ships.
         1. The Pellican. admirall. burthen 100. tonnes. Captaine
generall. Francis Drake.
         2. The Elizabeth. vice admirall. burthen 80. tonnes. Captaine
Iohn Winter.
         3. The Marigold. a bark of 30. tonnes. Captaine Iohn Thomas.
         4. The Swanne. a fliboat of 50. tonnes. Captaine Iohn Chester.
         
            
            
            
               A New and accurate Mappe of the World, drawne according to the best and latest discoveries that have beene made.
             
         
         
            
            
5. The Christopher. a pinnace of 15. tonnes. Captaine. Thomas
Moone.
         These ships he mand with 164. able and sufficient men, and
furnished them also with such plentifull prouision of all things
necessary, as so long and dangerous a voyage did seeme to require:
and amongst the rest, with certaine pinnaces ready framed,
but caried aboard in peices, to be new set vp in smoother
water, when occasion serued. Neither had he omitted, to make
prouision also for ornament and delight, carying to this purpose
with him, expert musitians, rich furniture (all the vessels for his
table, yea many belonging euen to the Cooke-roome being
of pure siluer) and diuers shewes of all sorts of curious workmanship,
whereby the ciuilitie and magnificence of his natiue contrie,
might, amongst all nations whithersoeuer he should come,
be the more admired.
         
             Being thus appointed we set saile out of the sound of Plimmouth,
about 5. of the clocke in the afternoone Nouember
15. of the same yeare, and running all that night Southwest, by
the morning were come as farre as the Lyzard, where meeting
the winde at Southwest (quite contrarie to our intended course)
we were forced, with our whole fleet to put in to Falmouth.
         
             The next day, towards euening, there arose a storme, continuing
all that night, and the day following (especially betweene
10. of the clocke in the forenoone, and 5. in the after noone)
with such violence, that though it were in a verygood harbor,
yet 2. of our ships viz. the admirall (wherein our generall himselfe
went) and the Marigold, were faine to cut their maine masts
by board, and for the repairing of them, and many other dammages
in the tempest sustained (as soone as the weather would
giue leaue) to beare backe to Plimmouth againe, where wee all
arriued the 13. day after our first departure thence.
         
         Whence (hauing in few daies supplied all defects) with happier
sayles we, once more put to sea Decem. 13. 1577.
            
         
         As soone as we were out of sight of land, our generall gaue
vs occasion to coniecture in part, whither he intended, both by

the directing of his course, and appointing the Randeuous (if
any should bee seuered from the fleet) to be the Iland Mogadore.
And so sailing with fauorable windes, the first land that
wee had sight of, was Cape Cantine in Barbarie December 25.
Christmas day in the morning. The shoare is faire white sand,
and the inland contrie very high and mountainous, it lieth in
32. deg. 30. mi. north latitude, and so coasting from hence
southward, about 18. leagues, we arriued the same day at
Mogadore the Iland before named.
         This Mogadore, lies vnder the dominion of the king of Fesse in
31. deg. 40. mi. about a mile off from the shoare, by this meanes
making a good harbor betweene the land and it. It is vninhabited,
of about a league in circuit, not very high land, all ouergrowne
with a kinde of shrub brest high, not much vnlike our
priuet, verie full of Doues and therefore much frequented of
Goshaukes, and such like birds of prey, besides diuers sorts of
sea-foule very plentie. At the south side of this Iland are three
hollow rocks, vnder which are great store of very wholesome
but very vglie fish to looke to. Lying here about a mile from
the maine, a boate was sent to sound the harbor, and finding it
safe, and in the very entrance on the north side about 5. or 6.
fathome water (but at the souther side it is very dangerous) we
brought in our whole fleet December 27. and continued there
till the last day of the same moneth, imploying our leasure, the
meane while, in setting vp a pinnace, one of the 4. brought from
home in peices with vs. Our abode here was soone perceiued by
the inhabitants of the contrie, who comming to the shoare, by
signes and cries made shewe, that they desired to be fetched aboard,
to whom our generall sent a boate, into which 2. of the
chiefest of the Moores were presently receiued, and one man
of ours, in exchange, left a land, as a pledge for their returne.
         They that came aboard were right courteously entertained,
with a daintie banquet, and such gifts as they seemed to be most
glad of, that they might thereby vnderstand, that this fleete
came in peace and friendship, offering to traffique with them,

for such commodities as their contrie yeelded, to their owne
content. This offer they seemed most gladly to accept, and promised,
the next day, to resort againe, with such things as they
had to exchange for ours. It is a law amongst them to drinke no
wine, notwithstanding by stealth it pleaseth them well to haue
it abundantly, as here was experience. At their returne ashoare,
they quietly restored the pledge which they had stayed, and the
next day, at the houre appointed, returning againe, brought
with them Camells, in shewe loaden with wares to be exchanged
for our commodities, and calling for a boate in haste, had
one sent them, according to order, which our generall (being at
this present absent) had giuen before his departure to the
Iland.
         Our boate comming to the place of landing (which was among
the rocks) one of our men called Iohn Fry, mistrusting no
danger, nor fearing any harme pretended by them, and therefore
intending to become a pledge, according to the order vsed
the day before, readilie stept out of the boate and ranne a land,
which oportunitie (being that which the Moores did looke for)
they tooke the aduantage of, and not onely they which were in
sight, layed hands on him to carrie him away with them, but a
number more, which lay secretly hidden, did forth with breake
forth from behinde the rocks, whither they had conueyed themselues
(as it seemeth the night before) forcing our men to leaue
the rescuing of him that was taken as captiue, and with speed to
shift for themselues.
         The cause of this violence, was a desire which the king of
Fesse had, to vnderstand what this fleet was, whether any forerunner
of the kings of Portugall or no, and what newes of certaintie
the fleet might giue him. And therefore after that he was
brought to the kings presence, and had reported that they were
Englishmen, bound for the straights, vnder the conduct of
generall Drake, he was sent back againe with a present to his
Captaine and offer of great curtesie and freindship, if he would
vse his contry But in this meane time, the generall being grieued
with this shew of iniurie, and intending, if he might, to recouer

or redeeme his man, his pinnace being ready, landed his company,
and marched somewhat into the countrie, without any
resistance made against him: neither would the Moores, by any
meanes come nigh our men, to deale with them any way;
wherefore hauing made prouision of wood, as also visited an old
fort, built sometime by the king of Portugall, but now ruined by
the king of Fesse, we departed December 31. towards Cape
Blanck, in such sort, that when Fry returned, he found to his
great griefe, that the fleet was gone: but yet, by the kings fauor,
he was sent home into England not long after, in an English
Merchants ship.
         Shortly after our putting forth of this harbour, we were met
with contrary windes and foule weather, which continued till
the fourth of Ianuary: yet we still held on our course, and the
third day after, fell with cape De Guerre in 30. deg. min. where
wee lighted on 3. Spanish fishermen called Caunters, whom
we tooke with our new pinnace, and caried along with vs, till
we came to Rio Del Oro, iust vnder the Tropick of Cancer:
where with our pinnace also we took a caruell. From hence, till
the fifteenth day, we failed on towards cape Barbas, where the
Marigold tooke a caruell more, and so onward to cape Blanck
till the next day at night.
         
         This cape lieth in 20. deg. 30. min. shewing it selfe vpright
like the corner of a wall, to them that come towards it from the
North, hauing, betweene it and cape Barbas, lowe, sandy, and
very white land all the way. Here we obserued the south Guards,
called the Crosiers 9. deg. 30. min. aboue the horizon. Within
the cape, we tooke one spanish ship more riding at anchor (all
her men being fled ashoare in the boate saue two) which, withall
the rest we had formerly taken, we caried into the harbor, 3.
leagues within the cape.
         Here our generall determined, for certaine dayes to make
his abode, both for that the place afforded plenty of fresh victualls,
for the present refreshing of our men, and for their future
supply at sea (by reason of the infinite store of diuers sorts of

good fish, which are there easie to be taken, euen within the
harbor, the like whereof, is hardly to be found againe, in any
part of the world) as also, because it serued very fitly, for the dispatching
of some other businesses that we had. During the time
of our abode in this place, our generall being ashoare was visited
by certaine of the people of the country, who brought
downe with them a woman a Moore (with her little babe hanging
vpon her dry dugge, hauing scarce life in herselfe, much
lesse milke to nourish her child) to be sould as a horse, or a cow
and calfe by her side, in which sort of merchandise our generall
would not deale. But they had also Amber-greece, with certaine
gummes of some estimation, which they brought to exchange
with our men for water (whereof they haue great want)
so that comming with their Allforges (they are leathern bags
holding liquor) to buy water, they cared not at what price they
bought it, so they might haue to quench their thirst. A very heauie
iudgement of God vpon that coast! The circumstances
whereof considered, our generall would receiue nothing of
them for water, but freely gaue it them that came to him, yea
and fed them also ordinarily with our victualls, in eating whereof,
their manner was not onely vnciuill, and vnsightly to vs, but
euen inhumane and loathsome in it selfe.
         And hauing washed and trimd our ships, and discharged all
our spanish prises, excepting one Caunter (for which we gaue to
the owner one of our owne ships viz. the Christopher) and one
caruell formerly bound to Saint Iago, which we caused to acompanie
vs hither, where shee also was discharged:  after 6. dayes
abode here, we departed, directing our course for the Ilands of
cape Verde, where (if any where) we were of necessity to store
our fleet with fresh water, for a long time, for that our generall
intended from thence to runne a long course (euen to the coast
of Brasill) without touch of land. And now, hauing the winde
constant at North East & East North East, which is vsuall about
those parts, because it bloweth almost continually from the
shoare. Ianuary the 27. we coasted Bonavista, and the next day

after, we came to anchor vnder the Wester part (towards Saint
Iago) of the Iland Maio, it lyeth in 15. deg. oo. high land, sauing
that the North-west part stretcheth out into the sea, the
space of a league very low, and is inhabited by subiects to the
king of Portugall.
         
             Here landing, in hope of traffique with the inhabitants for
water, we found a Towne, not farre from the waters side, of a
great number of desolate and ruinous houses, with a poore naked
Chappell or Oratory, such as small cost and charge might
serue and suffice, being to small purpose, and as it seemeth onely
to make a shew, and that a false shew, contrary to the nature
of a scarcrow, which feareth birds from comming nigh; this entiseth
such as passe by to hale in, and looke for commodity,
which is not at all to be found there; though in the inner parts
of the Iland it be in great abundance.
         For when wee found the springs and wells which had beene
there (as appeared) stopped vp againe, and no other water, to
purpose, to bee had to serue our need, we marched vp to seeke
some more conuenient place to supply our want, or at least to
see whether the people would be dealt withal, to helpe vs therein.
In this trauelling, we found the soile to be very fruitfull, hauing
euery where plenty of figgetrees, with fruite vpon most of
them. But in the vallies and low ground, where little low cottages
were built, were pleasant vineyards planted, bearing then,
ripe and most pleasant grapes. There were also tall trees, without
any branch till the top, which bare the Coco nuts. There were
also great store of certaine lower trees, with long and broad
leaues, bearing the fruit which they call Plantanes, in clusters together
like puddings, a most dainty and wholesome fruit. All
of these trees were euen laden with fruit, some ready to be eaten,
others comming forward, others ouer-ripe. Neither can this
seeme strange, though about the middest of Winter with vs, for
that the Sunne doth neuer withdraw himselfe farther off from
them, but that with his liuely heate he quickeneth and strengtheneth
the power of the soyle and plant; neither euer haue they

any such frost and cold, as thereby to loose their greene hew and
appearance.
         We found very good water in diuerse places, but so farre off
from the roade, that wee could not with any reasonable paines
enioy it. The people would by no meanes be induced to haue
any conference with vs, but keeping in the most sweet and fruitfull
vallies among the hils, where their townes and places of
dwelling were, gaue vs leaue without interruption to take our
pleasure in suruewing the Iland, as they had some reason, not to
endanger themselues, where they saw they could reape nothing
sooner then damage and shame, if they should haue offered violence
to them which came in peace to do them no wrong at all.
         This Iland yeeldeth other great commodities, as wonderfull
heards of goats, infinite store of wilde hens, and salt without labour
(onely the gathering it together excepted) which continually
in a maruellous quantitie is increased vpon the sands by
the flowing of the sea, and the heate of the Sunne kerning the
same. So that of the increase thereof they keepe a continuall traffique
with their neighbours in the other adiacent Ilands.  Wee
set sayle thence the 30. day.
         Being departed from Maio, the next day wee passed by the
Iland of Saint Iago, ten leagues West of Maio in the same latitude,
inhabited by the Portugals and Moores together. The
cause whereof is said to haue beene in the Portugals themselues,
who (continuing long time Lords within themselues, in the
said Iland) vsed that extreame and vnreasonable crueltie ouer
their slaues, that (their bondage being intollerable) they were
forced to seeke some meanes to helpe themselues, and to lighten
that so heauy a burden; and thereupon chose to flie into the
most mountany parts of the Iland: and at last, by continuall
escapes, increasing to a great number, and growing to a set
strength, do now liue, with that terror to their oppressors, that
they now endure no lesse bondage in mind then the Forcatos did
before in body: besides the dammage that they daily suffer at
their hands in their goods and cattell, together with the abridging

of their liberties in the vse of diuerse parts of the fruitfull
soile of the said Iland: which is very large, maruellous fruitfull (a
refuge for all such ships as are bound towards Brasill, Ginny, the
East Indies, Binny, Calecut. &c.) and a place of rare force, if it
were not for the cause afore-recited, which hath much abated
the pride, and cooled the courage of that people, who (vnder
pretence of traffique and friendship) at first making an entrance
ceased not, practising vpon the poore Ilanders (the ancient remainder
of the first planters thereof, as it may seeme from the
coast of Guinea) vntil they had excluded them from all gouernment
and liberty, yea almost life.
         On the South-west of this Iland, we tooke a Portugall laden
the best part with wine, and much good cloth, both linnen and
woollen, besides other necessaries, bound for Brasill, with many
gentlemen and Marchants in her.
         As we passed by with our fleet, in sight of 3. of their townes,
they seemed very ioyfull that wee touched not with their coast;
and seeing vs depart peaceably, in honour of our fleet and Generall,
or rather to signifie that they were prouided for an assault,
shot off two great peeces into the sea, which were answered
by one giuen them againe from vs.
         South west from Saint Iago in 14. deg. 30. min. about twelue
leagues distant, yet, by reason of the height seeming not aboue
three leagues lyeth another Iland, called of the Portugals Fogo,
viz. the burning Iland, or fierie fornace, in which riseth a steepe
vpright hill, by coniecture at least six leagues, or eighteene English
miles from the vpper part of the water: within the bowels
whereof, is a consuming fire, maintained by sulphury matter,
seeming to be of a maruellous depth, and also very wide. The
fire sheweth it selfe but foure times in an houre, at which times
it breaketh our with such violence and force, and in such maine
abundance, that besides that it giueth light like the Moone a
great way off, it seemeth, that it would not stay till it touch the
heauens themselues. Herein are ingendred great store of pumice
stones, which being in the vehement heate of the fire caried vp

without the mouth of that fiery body, fall downe, with other
grosse and slimy matter vpon the hill, to the continuall increasing
of the same. And many times these stones falling downe into
the sea are taken vp and vsed, as we our selues had experience
by sight of them swimming on the water. The rest of the Iland
is fruitfull notwithstanding, and is inhabited by Portugals, who
liue very commodiously therein, as in the other Ilands thereabout.
         Vpon the South side, about two leagues off this Iland of burning,
lyeth a most sweet and pleasant Iland, the trees thereof are
alwaies greene and faire to looke on, the soile almost full set with
trees, in respect wherof its named the Braue Iland, being a storehouse
of many fruits and commodities, as figges alwayes ripe,
cocos, plantons, orenges, limons, cotton, &c. from the bancks
into the sea do runne in many places the siluer streames of sweet
and wholsome water, which with boats or pinnaces may easily
be taken in. But there is no conuenient place or roade for ships,
neither any anchoring at all. For after long triall, and often casting
of leades, there could no ground be had at any hand, neither
was it euer knowne (as is reported) that any line would
fetch ground in any place about that Iland. So that the top of
Fogo burneth not so high in the aire, but the roote of Braua (so
is the Iland called) is buried and quenched as low in the seas.
         The onely inhabitant of this Iland is an Heremit, as we suppose,
for we found no other houses but one, built as it seemed
for such a purpose; and he was so delighted in his solitarie liuing,
that he would by no meanes abide our comming, but fled, leauing
behind him the relicks of his false worship; to wit, a crosse,
with a crucifix, an altar with his superaltar, and certaine other
idols of wood of rude workemanship.
         Here we dismissed the Portugals taken neere Saint Iago, and
gaue to them in exchange of their old ship, our new pinnace
built at Mogadore: with wine, bread, and fish for their prouision,
and so sent them away, Febr. 1.
         Hauing thus visited, as is declared, the Ilands of cape Verde,

and prouided fresh water as we could,  the second of Febr. we departed
thence, directing our course towards the straights, so to
passe into the South sea; in which course wee sayled 63. dayes
without sight of land (passing the line equinoctiall  the 17. day
of the same moneth) till we fell with the coast of Brasill, the fift
of April following.
         
         During which long passage on the vast gulph, where nothing
but sea beneath vs and aire aboue vs was to be seene, as our eies
did behold the wonderfull workes of God in his creatures, which
he hath made innumerable both small and great beasts, in the
great and wide seas: so did our mouthes taste, and our natures
feed on, the goodnesse thereof in such fulnesse at all times, and
in euery place, as if he had commanded and enioyned the most
profitable and glorious works of his hands to waite vpon vs, not
alone for the reliefe of our necessities, but also to giue vs delight
in the contemplation of his excellence, in beholding the variety
and order of his prouidence, with a particular tast of his fatherly
care ouer vs all the while.
         The truth is, wee often met with aduerse winds, vn welcome
stormes, and to vs (at that time) lesse welcome calmes, and being
as it were in the bosome of the burning zone, we felt the effects
of sultring heat, not without the affrights of flashing lightnings,
and terrifyings of often claps of thunder; yet stil with the admixture
of many comforts. For this we could not but take notice of,
that whereas we were but badly furnished (our case considered)
of fresh water (hauing neuer at all watred (to any purpose, or that
we could say wee were much the better for it) from our first setting
forth out of England till this time, nor meeting with any
place where we might conueniently water, till our comming to
the riuer of Plate, long after) continually, after once we were
come within foure degrees of the line on this side, viz. after Feb.
10. and till we were past the line as many degrees towards the
South, viz. till Feb. 27. there was no one day went ouer vs but
we receiued some raine, whereby our want of water was much
supplyed.
         
            
This also was obseruable, that of our whole fleet, being now
6. in number, notwithstanding the vncouthnes of the way, and
what euer other difficulties, by weather or otherwise wee met
withall, not any one, in all this space, lost company of the rest;
except onely our Portugall prise for one day, who March 28.
was seuered from vs, but the day following March 29. shee
found vs againe, to both here owne, and our no little comfort:
shee had in her 28. of our men, and the best part of all our prouision
for drinke; her short absence caused much doubting and
sorrow in the whole companie, neither could shee then haue
been finally lost, without the ouerthrow of the whole voyage.
         Among the many strange creatures which we sawe, we tooke
heedfull notice of one, as strange as any; to wit, the flying fish,
a fish of the bignes and proportion, of a reasonable or middle
sort of Pilchards: hee hath finnes, of the length of his whole
body, from the bulk to the top of the taile, bearing the forme,
and supplying the like vse to him, that wings doe to other creatures.
By the helpe of these finnes, whe?? he is chased of the Bonito,
or great mackrel (whom the Aurata or dolphin likewise pursueth)
and hath not strength to escape by swimming any longer, hee
lifteth vp himselfe aboue the water, and flieth a pretty height,
sometimes lighting into boates or barkes as they saile along:
The quills of their wings are so proportionable, and finelie set
together, with a most thinne and dainty filme, that they might
seeme to serue, for a much longer and higher flight, but the drienes
of them is such, after some 10. or 12. strokes, that hee must
needs into the water againe to moisten them, which else would
grow stiffe and vnfit for motion. The inrease of this little and
wonderfull creature is in manner infinite, the fry whereof lieth
vpon the vpper part of the waters, in the heate of the Sun, as
dust vpon the face of the earth, which being in bignesse of a
wheat straw, and length an inch more or lesse, do continually
exercise themselues in both their faculties of nature: wherein,
if the Lord had not made them expert indeed, their generation
could not haue continued, being so desired a prey to so many,

which greedily hunt after them, forcing them to escape in the
ayre by flight, when they cannot in the waters liue in safety.
Neither are they allwayes free, or without danger, in their flying;
but as they escape one euill, by refusing the waters so they
sometimes, fall into as great a mischiefe, by mounting vp into
the ayre, at that, by meanes of a great and rauening foule, named
of some a Don or Spurkite, who feeding chiefely, on such
fish as he can come by at aduantage, in their swimming in the
brim of the waters, or leaping aboue the same, presently ceaseth
vpon them with great violence, making great havock, especially
amongst these flying fishes, though with small profit to himselfe.
         There is another sort of fish, which likewise flieth in the ayre,
named a Cuttill: its the same, whose bones the goldsmithes
commonly vse, or at least not vnlike that sort, a multitude of
which, haue at one time, in their flight, fallen into our ship, amongst our men.
         Passing thus, in beholding the most excellent works of the
eternall God in the seas, as if we had beene in a garden of pleasure.
Aprill 5. we fell with the coast of Brasill, in 31. deg. 30. min.
towards the pole Antartick, where the land is lowe neere the
sea, but much higher within the countrie; hauing in depth not
aboue 12. fathome, 3. leagues off from the shoare: and being
descried by the inhabitants, we sawe great and huge fires,
made by them in sundry plaes. Which order of making fires,
though it be vniuersall, as well among Christians as heathens,
yet is it not likely that many doe vse it to that end, which the
Brasilians doe: to wit, for a sacrifice to Deuills, whereat they???
intermixe many and diuers ceremonies of coniurations, casting
vp great heapes of sand, to this end, that if any ships, shall go
about to stay vpon their coasts, their ministring spirits may
make wrack of them, whereof the Portugalls by the losse of diuers
of their ships, haue had often experience.
         In the reports of Magellanes voyage, it is said, that this people
pray to no maner of thing, but liue only according to the instinct
of nature, which if it were true, there should seeme to be a

wonderfull alteration in them, since that time, being fallen from
a simple and naturall creature, to make Gods of Deuills; But
I am of the minde, that it was with them then, as now it is, onely
they lacked then the like occasion, to put it in practise which
now they haue: for then, they liued as a free people among
themselues, but now, are in most miserable bondage and slauery,
both in body, goods, wife, and children, and life it self to the
Portugalls, whose hard and most cruell dealings against them,
forceth them to flie, into the more vnfruitful parts of their owne
land, rather there to starue, or at least liue miserably with libertie,
then to abide such intollerable bondage, as they lay vpon
them vsing the aforesaid practises with deuills, both for a reuenge
against their oppressors, and also for a defence, that they
haue no further entrance into the country. And supposing indeed,
that no other had vsed trauell by sea in ships, but their
enemies onely, they therefore vsed the same at our comming:
notwitstanding, our God made their deuilish intent of none effect;
For albeit there lacked not (within the space of our falling
with this coast) forcible stormes and tempests, yet did we sustaine
no dammage, but onely the seperating of our ships, out of
sight for a few dayes. Here our generall would haue gone ashore,
but we could finde no harbor in many leagues. And
therefore coasting along the land, towards the south, Aprill 7.
we had a violent storme, for the space of 3. houres, With thunder,
lightning, and raine in great abundance, accompanied
with a vehement south winde, directly against vs, which caused
a seperation of the Christopher (viz. the Caunter which wee
tooke at cape Blank, in exchange for the Christopher, whose
name she henceforward bore) from the rest of the fleet.
         After this, we kept on our course, sometime to the sea ward,
sometimes toward the shoare, but alwayes southward, as neere
as we could:  till Aprill 14. in the morning, at which time wee
passed by cape Saint Mary, which lies in 35. deg. neere
the mouth of the riuer of Plate: and running within it about 6.
or 7. leagues along by the maine, we came to anchor in a bay,

vnder another cape which our Generall afterwards called cape
Ioy by reason that the second day after our anchoring here, the
Christopher (whom we had lost in the former storme) came to
vs againe.
         Among other cares which our Generall tooke in this action,
next the maine care of effecting the voyage it selfe, these were
the principall and chiefly subordinate: to keepe our whole fleet
(as neere as possible we could) together; to get fresh water which
is of continuall vse; and to refresh our men wearied with long
toyles at sea, as oft as we should find any opportunitie of effecting
the same. And for these causes it was determined, and publique
notice thereof giuen at our departure from the Ilands of
cape Verde; that the next Randeuous both for the recollecting
of our nauy (if it should be despersed) as also for watering, and
the like, should be the riuer of Plate: whither we were all to repaire
with all the conuenient speed that could be made, and to
stay one for another, if it should happen that we could not arriue
there all together; and the effect wee found answerable to
our expectations, for here our seuered ship (as hath beene declared)
found vs againe, and here we found those other helps also
so much desired. The countrey hereabout is of a temperate
and most sweet aire, very faire and pleasant to behold, and besides
the exceeding fruitfulnesse of the soile, its stored with plentie
of large and mightie deere.
         Notwithstanding that in this first bay wee found sweet and
wholsome water euen at pleasure; yet the same day after the arriuall
of the Caunter, we remoued some twelue leagues farther
vp into another; where we found a long rocke, or rather Iland of
rocks, not farre from the maine; making a commodious harbor,
especially against a Southerly wind: vnder them we anchored,
and rode till the 20. day at night; in which meane space we killed
diuers Seales, or sea-wolues (as the Spaniard cals them) which
resorted to these rocks in great abundance. They are good meat,
and were an acceptable food to vs for the present, and a good
supply of our prouision for the future.
         
            
             Hence April 20. we waighed againe and sayled yet further
vp into the riuer, euen till we found but three fadome depth, and
that we roade with our ships in fresh water; but wee staid not
there, nor in any other place of the riuer, because that the winds
being strong, the shoales many, and no safe harbour found, we
could not without our great danger so haue done. Haling therefore
to seaward againe, the 27. of the same moneth (after that
we had spent a iust fortnight in that riuer, to the great comfort
of the whole fleet) we passed by the South side thereof into the
maine. The land here lieth South, South-West, and North N. E.
with shole water, some three or foure leagues off into the sea; its
about 36. deg. 20. min. and somewhat better South latitude.
         
             At our very first comming forth to sea againe, to wit, the same
night our flyboate the Swanne lost company of vs: whereupon,
though our Generall doubted nothing of her happy comming
forward againe to the rest of the fleete; yet because it was grieuous
to haue such often losses, and that it was his duty as much
as in him lay, to preuent all inconueniences besides, that might
grow; he determined to diminish the number of his ships, thereby
to draw his men into lesse roome; that both the fewer ships
might the better keepe company, and that they might also bee
the better appointed with new and fresh supplies of prouision
and men, one to ease the burthen of another: especially, for that
he saw the coast (it drawing now toward Winter here) to bee
subiect to many and grieuous stormes: And therefore he continued
on his course, to find out a conuenient harbour for that
vse; searching all that coast from 36. to 47. degrees (as diligently
as contrary winds and sundry stormes would permit) and yet
sound none for the purpose. And in the mean time viz. May 8. by
another storme the Caunter also was once more seuered fro?? vs.
         
            May 12. wee had sight of land, in 47. deg. where wee were
forced to come to anchor in such roade as we could find for the
time. Neuerthelesse our Generall named the place cape Hope; by
reason of a bay discouered within the hedland, which seemed to
promise a good and commodious harbour. But by reason of

many rockes lying off from the place, wee durst not aduenture
with our ships into it without good and perfect discouery before
hand made.
         Our Generall, especially in matters of moment, was neuer
wont to relye onely on other mens care, how trusty or skilfull
soeuer they might seeme to be; but alwayes contemning danger
and refusing no toyle, he was wont himselfe to be one whosoeuer
was a second at euery turne, where courage, skill, or industry
was to be imployed; neither would hee at this time intrust the
discouery of these dangers to anothers paines, but rather to his
owne experience in searching out and sounding of them.  A boat
being therefore hoised forth, himselfe with some others the next
morning, May 13. rowed into the bay; and being now very nigh
the shore, one of the men of the countrey shewed himselfe vnto
him seeming very pleasant, singing and dancing, after the noise
of a rattle which he shooke in his hand, expecting earnestly his
landing.
         But there was sudainly so great an alteration in the weather,
into a thick and misty fogge; together with an extreame storme
and tempest, that our generall, being now 3. leagues from his
ship, thought it better to returne, then either to land, or make
any other stay: and yet the fogg thickened so mightily, that the
sight of the ships was bereft them, and if Captaine Thomas (vpon
the abundance of his loue and seruice to his generall) had
not aduentured, with his ship to enter that bay, in this perplexitie,
where good aduise would not suffer our ships to beare in,
while the windes were more tolerable, and the ayre cleerer; we
had sustained some great losse, or our generall had beene further
endangered, who was now quickly receiued abord his ship; out
of which, being within the bay, they let fall an anchor, and rode
there (God be praised) in safety: but our other ships, riding
without, were so oppressed with the extremitie of the storme,
that they were forced to run off to sea for their owne safegard,
being in good hope onely of the good successe of that ship,
which was gone in to releiue our generall; before this storme

arose, our Caunter, formerly lost, was come in the same day
vnto vs into the roade, but was put to sea againe, the same euening,
with the rest of the fleete.
         
             The next day May 14. the weather being faire, and the
windes moderate, but the fleet out of sight, our generall determined
to goe ashore, to this end, that he might, by making of
fires, giue signes to the dispersed ships, to come together againe
into that roade: whereby at last, they were all assembled, excepting
the Swanne, lost long time before, and excepting our
Portugall prise, called the Mary; which waighing in this last
storme, the night before, had now lost company, and was not
found againe in a long time after.
         In this place (the people being remoued vp into the country,
belike for feare of our comming) we found neere vnto the rocks,
in houses made for that purpose, as also in diuers other places,
great store of Ostriches at least to the number of 50. with much
other foule; some dried and some in drying for their prouision,
as it seemed, to carrie with them to the place of their dwellings.
The Ostriches thighs were in bignes equall to reasonable
legs of murton, They cannot flie at all; but they runne so swiftly,
and take so long strides, that it is not possible for a man in running
by any meanes to take them, neither yet to come so nigh
them, as to haue any shot at them either with bow or peece:
Whereof our men had often proofe on other parts of that coast
for all the countrey is full of them; We found there the tooles
or instruments which the people vse in taking them.
         Among other meanes they vse in betraying these Ostriches,
they haue a great and large plume of feathers, orderly compact
together vpon the end of a staffe; in the forepart bearing the
likenesse of the head, necke, and bulke of an Ostrich; and in the
hinder part, spreading it selfe out very large, sufficient (being holden
before him) to hide the most part of the body of a man:
With this it seemeth they staulke, driuing them into some straite
or necke of land close to the sea side; where spreading long and
strong nets, with their dogs which they haue in readinesse at all

times, they ouerthrow them, and make a common quarry. The
countrey is very pleasant, and seemeth to be a fruitfull soyle.
         Being afterwards driuen to fall with this place againe, we had
great acquaintance and familiarity with the people, who reioyced
greatly in our comming, and in our friendship, in that wee
had done them no harme. But because this place was no fit or
conuenient harbor for vs, to do our necessary busines; neither
yet to make prouision, of such things as we wanted, as water,
wood, and such like, we departed thence the 15. of May.
         
         At our departure hence, we held our course South and by
VVest, and made about 9. leagues in 24. houres; bearing very
little sayle, that our fleet might the easier gett vp with vs, Which
by reason of the contrary windes, were cast a sterne of vs.
         In 47. deg. 30. min. we found a bay, which was faire, safe,
and beneficiall to vs, very necessary for our vse; into which
we haled, and anchored  May 17. and the next day  May 18. we
came further into the same bay, where we cast anchor, and made
our abode full fifteene dayes.
         The very first day of our arriuall here, our generall hauing set
things in some order, for the dispatch of our necessary busines,
being most carefull for his two ships which were wanting, sent
forth to the southward, Captaine Winter in the Elizabeth viceadmiral;
himself in the admiral, going forth northward, into the
sea, to see, if happily they might meete with either of them:
at which time, by the good prouidence of God, hee himselfe
met with the Swanne, formerly lost at our departure from the
riuer of Plate, and brought her into the same harbor, the same
day: where being afterward vnloaden, and discharged of her
fraight, shee was cast off, and her iron worke, and other necessaries
being saued, for the better prouision of the rest; of the remainder
was made fire wood, and other implements which we
wanted. But all this while, of the other ship which wee lost so
lately, in our extremitie, we could haue no newes.
         While we were thus employed, after certaine dayes of our
stay in this place, being on shoare, in an Iland, nigh vnto the

maine, where at lowe water was free passage on foot, from the
one to the other; the people of the country did shew themselues
vnto vs, with leaping, dancing, and holding vp their hands, and
making ourcries after their manner: but being then high water,
we could not go ouer to them on foot. Wherefore the Generall
caused immediatly a boat to bee in readinesse, and sent vnto
them such things as he thought would delight them; as kniues,
bells, bugles, &c. whereupon they beeing assembled together
vpon a hill, halfe an English mile from the waters side; sent
downe two of their company, running one after the other with
a great grace, trauersing their ground as it seemed after the manner
of their warres, by degrees descending towards the waters
side very swiftly. Notwithstanding drawing nigh vnto it, they
made a stay, refusing to come neere our men: which our men
perceiuing, sent such things as they had tyed with a string vpon
a rod, and stucke the same vp a reasonable distance from them,
where they might see it. And assoone as our men were departed
from the place, they came and tooke those things, leauing instead
of them, as in recompence, such feathers as they vse to
weare about their heads, with a bone made in manner of a toothpick,
carued round about the top, and in length about six inches,
being very smoothly burnished. Whereupon our Generall, with
diuers of his gentlemen and companie, at low water went ouer
to them to the maine.
         Against his comming they remained still vpon the hill, and
set themselues in a ranke, one by one; appointing one of their
company to runne before them from the one end of the ranke
to the other, and so backe againe, continually East and West,
with holding vp his hands ouer his head, and yeelding forward
his body in his running toward the rising and setting of the
Sunne: and at euery second or third turne at the most, erected
his body, aginst the midst of the ranke of the people, lifting
himselfe vaulting-wise from the ground towards the Moone,
being then ouer our heads: signifying thereby, as we conceiued,
that they called the Sunne and Moone (whom they serue for

gods) to witnesse, that they meant nothing towards vs but peace.
But when they perceiued that we ascended the hill apace, and
drew nigh vnto them, they seemed very fearefull of our comming.
         Wherefore our Generall not willing, to giue them any way
any occasion to mislike, or be discomfited, etyred his company;
wherby they were so allured, and did so therein confirme themselues
of vs, that we were no enemies, neither meant them harm,
that without al feare diuers came down with great speed after vs,
presently entring into traffique with our men. Notwithstanding
they would receiue nothing at our hands but the same must be
first cast vpon the ground, vsing this word, Zussus, for exchange
T??ytt to cast vpon the ground. And if they misliked any thing,
they cryed Cor??h. Cor??h, speaking the same with ratling in the
throat. The wares we receiued from them were arrowes of reeds,
feathers, and such bones as are afore described.
         This people go naked, except a skin of furre which they cast
about their shoulders, when they sit or lye in the cold: but hauing
any thing to do, as going or any other labour, they vse it as
a girdle about their loynes. They weare their haire very long, but
lest it might trouble them in their trauell, they knit it vp with a
roll of Ostrich feathers, vsing the same rolls and haire together
for a quiuer for their arrowes, and for a store house, in which
they carry the most things which they carry about them. Some
of them within these rolls sticke on either side of their heads
(for a signe of honour in their persons) a large and plaine feather
shewing like hornes afarre off: So that such a head vpon a naked
body (if diuels do appeare with hornes) might very nigh resemble
diuels.
         Their whole brauery and setting out themselues standeth in
painting their bodies with diuers colours, and such workes as
they can deuise. Some wash their faces with sulphure, or some
such like substance: some paint their whole bodies black, leauing
onely their neckes behind and before White, much like our damosels
that weare their squares, their neckes and breasts naked.

Some paint one shoulder blacke, another white??? and their sides
and legs interchangeably, with the same colours, one still contrary
to the other. The black part hath set vpon it white moones,
and the white part blacke Suns, being the marks and characters
of their gods, as is before noted.
         They haue some commodity by painting of their bodies, for
the which cause they vse it so generally: and that I gather to be
the defence it yeeldeth against the piercing and nipping cold.
For the colours being close layd on vpon their skinne, or rather
in their flesh, as by continuall renewing of these iuyces which
are layed on, soakt into the inner part thereof, doth fill vp the
pores so close that no aire or cold can enter, or make them once
to shrinke.
         They haue cleane, comely, and strong bodies: they are swift
of foot, and seeme very actiue. Neither is any thing more lamentable
(in my iudgement) then that so goodly a people, and
so liuely creatures of God, should bee ignorant of the true and
liuing God. And so much the more is this to be lamented, by
how much they are more tractable, and easie to be brought to
the sheepfold of Christ: hauing in truth a land sufficient to recompence
any Christian Prince in the world, for the whole trauell
and labour, cost and charges bestowed in that behalfe: with
a wonderfull enlarging of a kingdome, besides the glory of God
by encreasing of the Church of Christ.
         Its wonderfull to heare, being neuer knowne to Christians
before this time, how familiar they became in short space with
vs; thinking themselues to be ioyned with such a people, as they
ought rather to serue, then offer any wrong or iniurie vnto. Presuming
that they might be bold with our Generall as with a Father,
and with vs as with brethren and their neerest friends; neither
seemed their loue lesse towards vs. One of the chiefest
among them hauing on a time receiued a cap of our Generals
head, which he did daily weare, remouing himselfe but a little
from vs, with an arrow pierced his legge deepely, causing the
bloud to streame out vpon the ground: signifying thereby, how

vnfainedly he loued him, and giuing therin a couenant of peace:
The number of men which here did frequent our companie,
were about fiftie persons. Within, in the Southermost part of
this bay, there is a riuer of fresh water, with a great many profitable
Ilands; of which, some haue alwaies such store of Seales or
sea-wosues as were able to maintaine a huge army of men. Other
Ilands being many and great, are so replenished with birds and
foule, as if there were no other victuals, a wonderfull multitude
of people might be nourished by the increase of them for many
posterities. Of these we killed some with shot, and some with
status, and tooke some with our hands, from mens heads and
shoulders vpon which they lighted. We could not perceiue that
the people of the countrey had any sort of boate or canowe, to
come to these Ilands. Their owne prouision which they eate,
for ought we could perceiue, was commonly raw. For we should
sometimes find the remnants of Seales all bloudy which they
had gnawne with their teeth like dogs: They go all of them armed,
with a short bow of about an ell in length in their hands,
with arrowes of reeds, and headed with a flint stone, very cunningly
cut and fastned.
         This bay by reason of the plenty of Seales therein found (insomuch
that we killed two hundred in the space of one houre)
we called Seale, bay. And hauing now made sufficient prouision
of victuals and other necessaries, as also happily finished all our
businesses, Iune 3. we set saile from thence; And coasting along
towards the pole Antartick Iune 12. we fell with a little bay, in
which we anchored for the space of two dayes spent in the discharging
of our Caunter, the Christopher, which wee here
layed vp.
         
             The 14. day we waighed againe, and kept on our course Southward
till the 17. and then cast anchor in another bay in 50. deg.
20. min. lacking but little more then one degree, of the mouth of
the Straights, through which lay, our so much desited passage
into the South sea.
         Here our generall on good aduise determined to alter his

course; and turne his sterne to the Northward againe, if happily
God would grant we might find our ship and friends whom
we lost in the great storme, as is before said. Forasmuch as (if we
should enter the Straight without them in our company) it must
needs go hard with them; and we also in the meane time as well
by their absence, as by the vncertaintie of their state, must needs
receiue no small discomfort.
         
             And therefore Iune 18. in the morning putting to sea againe,
with hartie and often prayers wee ioyned watchfull industry to
serue Gods good prouidence: and held on our purpose to runne
backe toward the line into the same height, in which they were
first disseuered from vs.
         
             The 19. day of Iune toward night, hauing sayled within a few
leagues of port Saint Iulian, we had our ship in sight: for which
we gaue God thankes with most ioyfull minds. And forasmuch
as the ship was farre out of order, and very leake, by reason of
extremity of weather which she had endured, aswell before her
loosing company as in her absence: our Generall thought good
to beare into Port Saint Iulian with his fleet, because it was so
nigh at hand, and so conuenient a place: intending there to refresh
his wearied men, and cherish them which had in their absence
tasted such bitternesse of discomfort, besides the want of
many things which they sustained.
         
             Thus the next day the 20. of Iune we entred Port Saint Iulian:
which standeth in 49. deg. 30. min. and hath on the South
side of the harbour picked rockes like towers, and within the harbour
many Ilands, which you many ride hard aboard off, but in
going in you must borrow of the North shoare.
         Being now come to anchor, and all things fitted and made
safe aboard, our Generall with certaine of his companie, (viz.
Thomas Drake his brother, Iohn Thomas, Robert Winter, Oliuer
the Master gunner, Iohn Brewer, and Thomas Hood)  Iune 22.
rowed further in with a boate to find out some conuenient
place which might yeeld vs fresh water, during the time of our
abode there, and furnish vs with supply for prouision, to take to

sea with vs at our departure. Which worke as it was of great necessitie,
and therefore carefully to be performed; so did not he
thinke himselfe discharged of his duty, if he himselfe bestowed
not the first trauell therein, as his vse was at all times in all other
things, belonging to the relieuing of our wants, and the maintenance
of our good estate, by the supply of what was needfull.
Presently vpon his landing he was visited by two of the inhabitants
of the place, whom Magellane named Patagous, or rather
Pentagours from their huge stature, and strength proportionable:
These as they seemed greatly to reioyce at his arriuall, so did
they shew themselues very familiar, receiuing at our Generals
hands whatsoeuer he gaue them, and taking great pleasure in
seeing Master Oliuer master gunner of the Admirall, to shoot
an English arrow: trying with him to shoot at length, but came
nothing neere him.
         Not long after, came one more of the same laste, but of a
sowerer sorte, for he, misliking of the familiarity which his fellowes
had vsed, seemed very angry with them, and stroue earnestly
to withdrawe them, and to turne them to become our enemies;
Which our generall with his men not suspecting in the??,
vsed them as before: and one Mr. Robert Winter, thinking of
pleasure to shoote an arrow at length, as Mr. Oliuer had done
before, that he which came last also might haue a sight thereof,
the string of his bow brake; which, as before it was a terror vnto
them, so now broken, it gaue them great incouragement, and
boldnes, and as they thought, great aduantage in their treacherous
intent and purpose; not imagining that our calliuers,
swords, and targets, were any munition or weapon of warre.
         In which perswasion (as the generall with his companie
were, quietly without any suspition of euill, going downe
towards his boate) they sodainely being prepared, and gotten by
stealth behinde them, shot their arrowes; and cheifely at him
which had the bowe, not suffering him to string the same againe,
which he was about to haue done, as well as hee could:
but being wounded in the shoulder at the first shot, and turning

about, was sped with an arrow, which peirced his lunges, yet he
fell not. But the Mr. gunner being ready to shoote of his calliuer,
which tooke not fire in leuelling thereof, was presently
slaine out right. In this extremitie, if our generall had not beene
both expert in such affaires, able to judge, and giue present direction
in the danger thereof, and had not valiantly thrust himselfe
into the dance, against these monsters, there had no one of
our men, that there were landed, escaped with life. He therefore,
giuing order that no man should keepe any certaine
ground, but shift from place to place, encroaching still vpon the
enemie, vsing their targets, and other weapons for the defence
of their bodies, and that they should breake so many arrowes, as
by any meanes they could come by, being shot at them; wherein
he himselfe was very diligent, and carefull also in calling on
them, knowing that their arrowes being once spent, they should
haue these enemies at their deuotion and pleasure, to kill or
saue, and this order being accordingly taken, himselfe I say with
a good courage and trust in the true and liuing God, taking and
shooting off, the same peece, which the gunner could not make
to take fire, dispatched the first beginner of the quarrell, the same
man which slewe our Mr. gunner. For the peece being charged
with a bullet, and haile shot, and well aimed, tare out his bellie
and gutts, with great torment, as it seemed by his cry, which
was so hideous and horrible a roare, as if ten bulls had ioyned
together in roaring, wherewith the courage of his partners was
so abated, and their hearts appalled, that notwithstanding, diuerse
of their fellowes and countriemen appeared out of the
woods, on each side: yet they were glad, by flying away, to
saue themselues, quietly suffering our men either to depart or
stay. Our generall chose rather to depart, then to take further
reuenge of them, which now he might, by reason of his wounded
man, whom for many good parts he loued dearely; and
therefore would rather haue saued him, then slaine an hundred
enemies, but being past recouery, he died the 2. day, after his
being brought aboard againe.
         
            
That night our Mr. gunners body being left ashoare, for the
speedier bringing of the other aboard, our generall himselfe the
next day, with his boate well appointed, turned to the shoare,
to fetch it likewise: which they found lying where it was left,
but stript of his vppermost garment, and hauing an english arrow
stucke in his right eye.
         Both of these dead bodies were layd together in one graue,
with such reuerence, as was fit for the earthen tabernacles of
immortall soules; and with such commendable ceremonies, as
belong vnto souldiers of worth, in time of warre, which they
most truly and rightfully deserued.
         Magellane was not altogether deceiued, in naming them
Giants; for they generally differ from the common sort of
men, both in stature, bignes, and strength of body, as also in
the hideousnesse of their voice: but yet they are nothing so
monstrous, or giantlike as they were reported; there being
some English men, as tall, as the highest of any that we could
see, but peraduenture, the Spaniards did not thinke, that euer,
any English man would come thither, to reproue them; and
therevpon might presume the more boldly to lie: the name
Pentagones, Fiue cubits viz. 7. foote and halfe, describing the full
height (if not some what more) of the highest of them.
         But this is certaine, that the Spanish cruelties there vsed,
haue made them more monstrous, in minde and manners, then
they are in body; and more inhospitable, to deale with any
strangers, that shall come hereafter. For the losse of their friends
(the reme??brance wherof is assigned and conueighed ouer from
one generation to another, among their posteritie) breedeth an
old grudge, which will not easily be forgotten, with so quarrellsome
and revengefull a people. Notwithstanding the terrour
which they had conceiued of vs, did henceforward so quench
their heate, and take downe their edge, that they both forgate
reuenge, and seeming by their countenance, to repent
them of the wrong they had offered vs, that meant them no
harme, suffered vs to doe what we would, the whole space of

two monethes after this, without any interruption or molestation
by them, and it may perhaps be a meanes, to breede
a peace in that people, towards all that may hereafter this,
come that way.
         To this euill, thus receiued at the hands of infidells, there was
adioyned, and grew another mischiefe, wrought and contriued
closely amongst our selues, as great, yea farre greater, and of farre
more greiuous consequence then the former: but that it was,
by Gods prouidence, detected and preuented in time, which
else had extended it selfe, not onely to the violent shedding of
innocent blood, by murthering our generall and such others as
were most firme and faithfull to him: but also to the finall ouerthrow
of the whole action intended, and to diuers other most
dangerous effects.
         These plotts had beene layd before the voyage beganne in
England: the very modell of them was shewed, and declared to
our generall in his garden at Plimmouth, before his setting sayle,
which yet he either would not credit, as true or likely, of a person
whom he loued so deerely, and was perswaded of to loue
him likewise vnfainedly, or thought by loue and benefits, to remoue
and remedy it, if there were any euill purposes conceiued
against him.
         And therfore, he did not onely continue (to this suspected &
accused person) al countenance, credit, and courtesies, which he
was wont to shew & giue him, but encreased them, vsing him in
a manner as another himselfe, and as his most inmost friend:
lodging him with himselfe; giuing him the second place, in all
companies, in his presence; leauing in his hand, the state as it
were of his owne person; in his absence; imparting vnto him
all his counsells; allowing him free liberty in all things, that
were reasonable; and bearing often, at his hands great infirmities;
yea despising, that any priuate iniury, should breake so
firme a friendship, as he meant towards him. And therefore, was
he often times not a little offended, euen with those, who (vpon
conscience of their duty, and knowledge that otherwise they

should indeed offend) disclosed from time to time vnto him,
how the fire increased, that theatned his owne, together with
the destruction of the whole action.
         But at length, perceiuing that his lenity and fauours did little
good; in that the heat of ambition was not yet allayed, nor
could be quenched, as it seemed, but by blood; and that the
manifold practises grew dayly more and more, euen to extremities;
he thought it high time, to call these practises into question,
before it were too late, to call any question of them into
hearing. And therefore setting good watch ouer him, and assembling
all his Captaines, and gentlemen of his comapany together;
he propounded to them, the good parts which were in
the gentleman, the great good will, and inward affection, more
then brotherly, which he had euer, since his first acquaintance
borne him, not omitting the respect, which was had of him,
among no meane personages in England; and afterwards deliuered
the letters, which were written to him, with the particulars
from time to time, which had beene obserued, not so much
by himselfe, as by his good friends; not onely at sea, but euen
at Plimmouth; not bare words but writings; not writings alone,
but actions, tending to the ouerthrowe of the seruice in
hand, and making away of his person.
         Proofes were required and alleaged, so many, and so euident,
that the gentleman himselfe, stricken with remorse of his inconsiderate
and vnkinde dealing, acknowledged himselfe to haue
deserued death, yea many deathes; for that he conspired, not
onely the ouerthrow of the action, but of the principall actor
also, who was not a stranger or il-willer, but a deare and
true friend vnto him: and therefore in a great assembly openly
besought them, in whose hands iustice rested, to take some
order for him; that he might not be compelled, to enforce his
owne hands, against his owns bowells, or otherwise to become
his owne executioner.
         The admiration and astonishment hereat, in all the hearers
euen those which were his neerest friends, and most affected him

was great, yea in those, which for many benefits receiued from
him, had good cause to loue him: but yet the generall was
most of all distracted; and therefore withdrewe himselfe, as not
able to conceale his tender affection, requiring them, that had
heard the whole matter, to giue their iudgements, as they would
another day answer it vnto their prince, and vnto almightie
God, judge of all the earth. Therefore they all, aboue 40. in
number, the chiefest of place and judgement in the whole fleet,
after they had discussed diuersly of the case, and alleaged whatsoeuer
came in their mindes, or could be there produced by any
of his other friends, with their owne hands, vnder seale, adiudged
that: He had deserued death: And that it stoode, by no meanes
with their safety, to let him liue: And therefore, they remitted the
manner thereof, with the rest of the circumstances to the generall.
         This judgement, and as it were assise, was held a land, in one
of the Ilands of that port; which afterwards, in memory hereof
was called, the Iland of True iustice and iudgement.
         Now after this verdict was thus returned vnto our generall
(vnto whom, for his company, her maiestie before his departure,
had committed her sword, to vse for his safety, with this
word: We doe account that he which striketh at thee Drake striketh
at vs) he called for the guilty party, and caused to be read vnto
him, the seuerall verdicts which were written, and pronounced
of him, which being acknowledged for the most part (for none
had giuen heauier sentence against him, then he had giuen against
himselfe) our generall proposed vnto him this choice:
whether he would take, to be executed in this Iland? or to be sett aland
on the maine? or returne into England, there to answer his
deed before the Lords of her maiesties Councell?
         He most humbly thanked the generall for his clemencie, extended
towards him in such ample sort: and crauing some respit,
to consult thereon, and so make his choice aduisedly: the
next day he returned this answer, that: Albeit he had yeelded in
his heart, to entertaine so great a sinne; as whereof now he was iustly
condemned: yet he bad a care, and that excelling all other cares,

to die a christian man, that whatsoeuer did become of his clay body, he
might yet remaine assured of an eternall inheritance, in a farre better
life. This he feared, if he should be set a land among Infidels, how
he should be able to maintaine this assurance, feeling in his owne
frailtie, how mighty the contagion is of lewde custome. And therefore
he besought the generall most earnestly, that he would yet
haue a care, and regard of his soule; and neuer jeopard it amongst
heathen and sauage Infidells. If he should returne into England, he
must first haue a ship, and men to conduct it, with sufficient victuals:
two of which though they were had, yet for the third, he
thought no man would accompanie him, in so bad a message to so vile
an issue, from so honorable a seruice. But if that there were, which
could induce their mindes, to returne with him; yet the very shame
of the returne, would be as death, or grieuouser if it were possible: hecause
be should be so long a dying, and die so often. Therefore he professed,
that with all his heart, he did embrace the first branch of the
generals proffer; desiring onely this fauour, that they might receiue
the holy communion, once againe together before his death; and that
he might not die, other then a gentlemans death.
         Though sundry reasons were vsed by many, to perswade him
to take either of the other wayes: yet when he remained resolute
in his former determination, both parts of his last request
were granted: and the next conuenient day, a communion was
celebrated, by Mr. Francis Fletcher, preacher and pastor of the
fleet at that time. The generall himselfe communicated in this
Sacred ordinance, with this condemned penitent gentleman;
who shewed great tokens of a contrite and repentant heart, as
who was more deepely displeased with his owne act, then any
man else. And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same
table together, as cheerefully in sobriety, as euer in their liues
they had done aforetime: each cheering vp the other, and
taking their leaue, by drinking each to other, as if some journey
onely had beene in hand.
         After dinner, all things being brought in a readines, by him
that supplied the roome of the prouost Marshall; without any

dallying, or dolaying the time, he came forth, and kneeled
downe, preparing at once, his necke for the axe, and his spirit
for heauen: which hauing done, without long ceremony, as
who had before digested this whole tragedy, he desired all the
rest to pray for him, and willed the executioner to doe his office,
not to feare nor spare.
         Thus hauing by the worthie manner of his, death (being
much more honorable by it, then blameable for any other of his
actions) fully blotted out, what euer staine, his fault might
seeme to bring vpon him; he left vnto our fleete, a lamentable
example of a goodly gentleman, who in seeking aduancement
vnfit for him, cast away himselfe: and vnto posteritie a monument,
of I know not what, fatall calamitie, incident to that Port,
and such like actions, which might happilie afford a new paire
of paralells, to be added to Plutarchs: in that the same place,
neere about the same time of the yeare, witnessed the execution
of 2. gentlemen, suffring both for the like cause, employed both
in like seruice, entertained both in great place, endued both
with excellent qualities, the one 58. yeare after the other.
         For on the maine, our men found a gibbet, fallen downe,
made of a spruce mast, with mens bones vnderneath it, which
they coniectured to be the same gibbet, which Magellane commanded
to be erected, in the yeare 1520. for the execution, of
Iohn Carthagene the Bishop of Burgos cosen, who by the kings
order, was ioyned with Magellane in commission, and made his
vice-admirall.
         In the Iland, as we digged to burie this gentleman, we found
a great grinding stone, broken in two parts, which wee tooke
and set fast in the ground, the one part at the head, the other at
the feet, building vp the middle space, with other stones and
turfes of earth, and engraued in the stones, the names of the parties
buried there, with the time of their departure, and a memoriall
of our generalls name in Latine, that it might the better be
vnderstood, of all that should come after vs.
         These things thus ended, and set in order, our generall discharging

the Mary viz. our Portugall prise, because shee was
leake and troublesome, defaced her; and then left her ribs and
keele vpon the Iland: where for two moneths together we had
pitched our tents. And so hauing wooded, watered, trimmed
our ships, dispatched all our other businesses, and brought our
fleet into the smallest number, euen 3. onely, besides our pinnaces,
that we might the easier keepe our selues together, be the
better furnished with necessaries, and be the stronger mand, against
what soeuer need should be, August 17. we departed out
of this port, and being now in great hope, of a happie issue to
our enterprise, which almighty god hitherto had so blest and
prospered, we set our course for the Straights. Southwest.
         August 20. we fel with the cape; neere which lies the entrance
into the straight, called by the Spaniards Capo virgin Maria,
appearing 4. leagues before you come to it with high and
steepe gray cliffes, full of blacke starres, against which the sea
beating, sheweth as it were the spoutings of Whales, hauing the
highest of the cape, like cape vincent in Portugall: At this cape,
our generall caused his fleet, in homage to our soueraigne lady
the Queenes maiesty, to strike their top-sailes vpon the bunt,
as a token of his willing and glad minde, to shewe his dutifull obedience
to her highnes, whom he acknowledged to haue full
interest and right, in that new discouery; and withall, in remembrance
of his honorable friend and fauorer, Sir Christopher
Hatton, he changed the name of the shippe, which himselfe went
in, from the Pellican to be called the golden Hinde. Which ceremonies
being ended, together with a sermon, teaching true obedience,
with prayers and giuing of thankes for her maiesty,
and most honorable counsell, with the whole body of the common
weale, and church of God, we continued our course on
into the said frete, where passing with land in fight on both sides,
we shortly fell with so narrow a straite, as carrying with it much
winde, often turnings, and many dangers, requireth an expert
judgement, in him that shall passe the same, it lieth West North
West & East South East: but hauing left this straite a sterne, we

seemed to be come out of a riuer of two leagues broade, into a
large and maine sea, hauing the night following, an Iland in
sight, which (being in height nothing inferior to the Iland Fogo,
before spoken of) burneth (like it aloft) also in the aire, in a wonderfull
sort, without intermission.
         It hath formerly beene receiued as an vndoubted truth, that
the seas, following the course of the first mouer, from East to
West, haue a continuall current through this straite, but our
experience found the contrary: the ebbings and flowings here,
being as orderly (in which the water rises and falls more then 5.
fathomes, vpright) as on other coasts.
         The 24 of August being Bartholomew day, we fell with 3.
Ilands, bearing triangle-wise one from another, one of them
was very faire and large, and of a fruitfull soile, vpon which being
next vnto vs, and the weather very calme, our generall with
his gentlemen, and certaine of his mariners, then landed; taking
possession thereof in her Maiesties name, and to her vse, and called
the same Elizabeth Iland.
         The other two, though they were not so large, nor so faire to
the eye, yet were they to vs exceeding vsefull, for in them wee
found great store of strange birds, which could not flie at all, nor
yet runne so fast, as that they could escape vs with their liues: in
body they are lesse then a goose, and bigger then a mallard,
short and thicke set together, hauing no feathers, but insteed
thereof, a certaine hard and matted downe; their beakes are not
much vnlike the bills of crowes, they lodge and breed vpon the
land, where making earthes, as the conies doe, in the ground,
they lay their egges, and bring vp their young; their feeding
and prouision to liue on, is in the sea, where they swimm in such
sort, as nature may seeme to haue granted them no small prerogatiue
in swiftnesse, both to prey vpon others, and themselues to
escape from any others that seeke to cease vpon them, and such
was the infinite resort of these birds to these Ilands, that in the
space of 1. day, we killed no lesse then 3000. & if the increase be
according to the number, it is not to be thought, that the world

hath brought forth, a greater blessing in one kinde of creature
in so small a circuit, so necessarily and plentifully seruing the vse
of man, they are a very good and wholesome victuall: our generall
named these Ilands, the one Bartholomew, according to
the day; the other Saint Georges, in honour of England, according
to the ancient custome there obserued.
         In the Iland of Saint George, we found the body of a man, so
long dead before, that his bones would not hold together, being
moued out of the place whereon they lay.
         From these Ilands, to the entrance into the South sea, the
frete is very crooked; hauing many turnings, and as it were shuttings
vp, as if there were no passage at all, by meanes whereof, we
were often troubled with contrary windes, so that some of our
ships, recouering a cape of land, entring another reach, the rest
were forced to alter their course, and come to anchor where
they might. It is true which Magellane reporteth of this passage:
namely that there be many faire harbours, and store of
fresh water; but some ships, had need to be fraughted with nothing
else, besides anchors and cables, to finde ground, in most
of them, to come to anchor; which when any extreame gusts,
or contrary windes doe come (whereunto the place is altogether
subiect) is a great hindrance to the passage and carrieth
with it no small danger.
         The land on both sides is very high and mountainous, hauing
on the North and West side the continent of America,
and on the South and East part, nothing but Ilands: among
which, lye innumerable fretes or passages into the South sea.
The mountaines arise with such tops, and spires into the aire, &
of so rare a height, as they may well be accounted amongst the
wonders of the world; enuironed as it were, with many regions
of congealed clouds, and frozen meteors, wherby they are continually
fed and increased, both in height and bignes, from time
to time, retaining that which they haue once receiued, being
little againe diminished by the heate of the sun, as being so farre
from reflexion, and so nigh the cold and frozen region.
         
            
But notwithstanding all this, yet are the lowe and plaine
groundes verie fruitful, the grasse greene and naturall; the hearbs
that are of very strange sorts, good and many; the trees for
the most part of them alwaies greene; the ayre of the temperature
of our countrey, the water most pleasant; and the soile
agreeing to any graine which we haue growing in our countrie:
a place no doubt, that lacketh nothing, but a people to vse the
same to the Creators glory, and the encreasing of the Church:
the people inhabiting these parts, made fires as we passed by in
diuers places.
         Drawing nigh the entrance of the South sea, wee had such a
shutting vp to the Northwards, and such large and open fretes
toward the South, that it was doubtfull which way wee should
passe, without further discouerie: for which cause, our generall
hauing brought his fleete to anchor vnder an Iland; himselfe,
with certaine of his gentlemen, rowed in a boate to descrie the
passage; who hauing discouered a sufficient way towards the
North, in their returne to their ships, met a cannowe vnder the
same Iland, where wee rode then at anchor, hauing in her diuers
persons.
         This cannowe or boate was made of the barke of diuers
trees, hauing a prowe and a sterne standing vp, and semicirclewise
yeelding inward, of one forme and fashion; the body
whereof was a most dainty mould, bearing in it most comely
proportion, and excellent workmanship; in so much as to our
generall and vs, it seemed neuer to haue beene done, without
the cunning and expert iudgement of art; and that not for the
vse of so rude and barborous a people, but for the pleasure of
some great and noble personage, yea of some Prince: It had no
other closing vp or caulking in the seames, but the stitchin with
thongs, made of Seale-skins, or other such beast, and yet so close
that it receiued very little or no water at all.
         The people are of a meane stature, but well set and compact,
in all their parts and limmes; they haue great pleasure in painting
their faces, as the others haue, of whom we haue spoken

before. Within the said Iland they had a house of meane building,
of certaine poles, and couered with skinnes of beast; hauing
therein fire, water, and such meate, as commonly they can
come by: as seales, mussels, and such like.
         The vessels wherein they keepe their water, and their cups in
which they drinke, are made of barkes of trees, as was their canow:
and that with no lesse skill (for the bignesse of the thing)
being of a very formall shape and good fashion. Their working
tooles, which they vse in cutting these things and such other,
are kniues made of most huge and monstrous mussell shels (the
like whereof haue not beene seene or heard of lightly by any
trauellers; the meate thereof beeing very sauourie and good in
eating) which, after they haue broken off the thinne and brittle
substance of the edge, they rub and grinde them vpon stones
had for the purpose, till they haue tempered and set such an edge
vpon them, that no wood is so hard but they will cut it at pleasure
with the same: whereof we our selues had experience. Yea
they cut therewith bones of a maruellous hardnesse; making of
them fisgies to kill fish, wherein they haue a most pleasant exercise
with great dexteritie.
         
             The sixth of September we had left asterne vs all these troublesome
Ilands, and were entred into the South sea, or Mare
del zur: at the cape whereof, our Generall had determined with
his whole company to haue gone ashore, and there after a Sermon
to haue left a monument of her Maiestie ingrauen in mettall,
for a perpetuall remembrance; which he had in a readinesse
for that end prepared: but neither was there any anchoring,
neither did the wind suffer vs by any meanes to make a stay.
         Onely this by all our mens obseruations was concluded; that
the entrance, by which we came into this straite, was in 52. deg.
the middest in 53. deg. 15. m and the going out in 52. deg. 30. m.
being 150. leagues in length: At the very entry, supposed also
to be about 10. leagues in bredth. After we were entred ten
leagues within it, it was found not past a league in breadth: farther
within, in some places very large, in some very narrow, and

in the end found to be no straite at all, but all Ilands.
         Now when our Generall perceiued that the nipping cold, vnder
so cruell and frowning a Winter, had empaired the health
of some of his men; hee meant to haue made the more hast againe
toward the line, and not to saile any farther towards the
pole Antartick, lest being father from the Sunne, and neerer
the cold, we might happily be ouertaken with some greater danger
of sickness. But God giuing men leaue to purpose, reserueth
to himselfe the disposition of all things: making their intents of
none effect, or changing their meanings oft times cleane into
the contrary, as may best serue for his owne glory and their
profit.
         
             For September 7. the second day after our entrance into the
South sea (called by some Mare pacificum, but prouing to vs rather
to be Mare furiosum.) God by a contrary wind and intollerable
tempest, seemed to set himselfe against vs: forcing vs not
onely to alter our course and determination, but with great
trouble, long time, many dangers, hard escapes, and finall separating
of our fleet, to yeeld ourselues vnto his will. Yea such was
the extremitie of the tempest, that it appeared to vs as if he had
pronounced a sentence, not to stay his hand, nor to withdraw his
iudgement till he had??? buried our bodies and ships also, in the
bottomlesse depth of the raging sea.
         
             In the time of this incredible storme the 15. of September,
the Moone was ecclipsed in Aries, and darkened about three
points, for the space of two glasses: which being ended, might
seeme to giue vs some hope of alteration and change of weather
to the better. Notwithstanding, as the ecclipticall conflict, could
adde nothing to our miserable estate, no more did the ending
thereof ease vs any thing at all; nor take away any part of our
troubles from vs: but our ecclipse continued still in its full force,
so preuailing against vs, that for the space of full 52. dayes together,
we were darkened more then the Moone by 20. parts, or
more then we by any meanes could euer haue preserued, or recouered
light of our selues againe, if the Sonne of God which

layed this burthen vpon our backs, had not mercifully borne it
vp with his owne shoulders, and vpheld vs in it by his owne
power, beyond any possible strength or skill of man. Neither
indeed did we at all escape, but with the feeling of great discomforts
through the same.
         For these violent and extraordinarie flawes (such as seldome
haue been seene) still continuing, or rather increasing, September
30. in the night, caused the sorrowfull separation of the Marigold
from vs, in which was Captaine Iohn Thomas, with many
others of our deare friends: who by no means that we could conceiue
could helpe themselues, but by spooming along before
the sea. With whom albeit wee could neuer meet againe, yet
(our Generall hauing aforehand giuen order, that if any of our
fleet did loose company, the place of resort to meet againe
should be in 30. deg. or thereabouts, vpon the coast of Peru, toward
the Equinoctiall) wee long time hoped (till experience
shewed our hope was vaine) that there we should ioyfully meet
with them: especially for that they were well prouided of victuals,
and lackt no skilfull and sufficient men (besides their Captaine)
to bring forwards the ship to the place appointed.
         From the seuenth of September (in which the storme began)
till the seuenth of october we could not by any meanes recouer
any land (hauing in the meane time beene driuen so farre South,
as to the 57. deg. and somewhat better) on this day towards
night, somewhat to the Northward of that cape of America
(whereof mention is made before in the description of our departure
from the straite into this sea) with a sorrie saile wee entred
a harbour: where hoping to enioy some freedome and ease,
till the storme was ended, we receiued within few houres after
our comming to anchor, so deadly a stroake and hard entertainement,
that our Admirall left not onely an anchor behind her,
through the violence and furie of the flawe; but in departing
thence, also lost the company and sight of our Vice-admirall,
the Elizabeth: partly through the negligence of those that had
the charge of her, partly through a kind of desire that some in

her had to be out of these troubles, and to be at home againe:
which (as since is knowne) they thence forward by all meanes
assayed and performed. For the very next day October 8. recouering
the mouth of the straits againe (which wee were now so
neere vnto) they returned backe the same way by which they
came forward, and so coasting Brasill, they arriued in England
Iune 2. the yeare following.
         So that now our Admirall if she had retained her old name
of Pellican, which she bare at our departure from our countrey,
she might haue beene now indeed said to be as a Pellican alone
in the wildernesse. For albeit our Generall sought the rest of his
fleet with great care, yet could we not haue any sight or certaine
ne wes of them by any meanes.
         From this bay of parting of friends, we were forcibly driuen
backe againe into 55. deg. towards the pole Antarticke. In
which height we ranne in among the Ilands before mentioned,
lying to the Southward of America, through which we passed
from one sea to the other, as hath beene declared. Where comming
to anchor, wee found the waters there to haue their indraught
and free passage, and that through no small guts, or narrow
channels, but indeed through as large frets or straights, as
it hath at the supposed streights of Magellane through which we
came.
         Among these Ilands, making our abode with some quietnesse
for a very little while,(viz. two dayes) and finding diuers good
and wholesome herbs together with fresh water; our men which
before were weake, and much empaired in their health, began to
receiue good comfort: especially by the drinking of one herbe
(not much vnlike that herbe which wee commonly call Pennylease)
which purging with great facilitie affoorded great helpe
and refreshing to our wearied and sickly bodies. But the winds
returning to their old wont, and the seas raging after their former
manner, yea euery thing as it were setting it selfe against our
peace and desired rest, here was no stay permitted vs, neither any
safety to be looked for.
         
            
For such was the present danger by forcing and continuall
slawes, that we were rather to looke for present death then hope
for any deliuery, if God almightie should not make the way for
vs. The winds were such as if the bowels of the earth had set all
at libertie; or as if all the clouds vnder heauen had beene called
together, to lay their force vpon that one place: The seas, which
by nature and of themselues are heauie, and of a weightie substance,
were rowled vp from the depths, euen from the roots of
the rockes, as if it had beene a scroll of parchment, which by the
extremity of heate runneth together: and being aloft were carried
in most strange manner and abundance, as feathers or drifts
of snow, by the violence of the winds, to water the exceeding
tops of high and loftie mountaines. Our anchors, as false friends
in such a danger, gaue ouer their holdfast, and as if it had beene
with horror of the thing, did shrinke downe to hide themselues
in this miserable storme; committing the distressed ship and
helpelesse men to the vncertaine and rowling seas, which tossed
them, like a ball in a racket. In this case, to let fall more anchors,
would auaile vs nothing; For being driuen from our first place
of anchoring, so vnmeasurable was the depth, that 500. fathome
would fetch no ground: So that the violent storme without intermission;
the impossibility to come to anchor; the want of opportunitie
to spread any sayle, the most mad seas; the lee shores;
the dangerous rocks; the contrary and most intollerable winds;
the impossible passage out; the desperate tarrying there; and ineuitable
perils on euery side, did lay before vs so small likelihood
to escape present destruction, that if the speciall prouidence of
God himselfe had not supported vs, we could neuer haue endured
that wofull state: as being inuironed with most terrible and
most fearefull iudgements round about. For truly, it was more
likely that the mountaines should haue beene rent in sunder,
from the top to the bottome, and cast headlong into the sea, by
these vnnaturall winds; then that, we, by any helpe or cunning
of man, should free the life of any one amongst vs.
         Notwithstanding the same God of mercy which deliuered

Ionas out of the Whales belly, and heareth all those that call vpon
him faithfully, in their distresse; looked downe from heauen,
beheld our teares, and heard our humble petitions, ioyned with
holy vowes. Euen God (whom not the winds and seas al one,
but euen the diuels themselues and powers of hell obey) did so
wonderfully free vs, and make our way open before vs, as it were
by his holy Angels still guiding and conduting vs, that more
then the affright and amaze of this estate, we receiued no part of
damage in all the things that belonged vnto vs.
         But escaping from these straites and miseries, as it were
through the needles ey (that God might haue the greater glory
in our deliuery) by the great and effectuall care and trauell of
our Generall, the Lords instrument therein; we could now no
longer forbeare, but must needes finde some place of refuge,
aswell to prouide water, wood, and other necessaries, as to comfort
our men, thus worne and tired out, by so many and so long
intollerable toyles: the like whereof, its to be supposed, no traueller
hath felt, neither hath there euer beene, such a tempest
(that any records make mention of) so violent, and of such continuance,
since Noahs flood, for as hath beene sayd it lasted
from September 7. to October 28, full 52. dayes.
         Not many leagues therefore to the Southwards of our former
anchoring, we ranne in againe among these Ilands; where
we had once more better likelihood to rest in peace: and so
much the rather, for that wee found the people of the countrie,
trauelling for their liuing, from one Iland to another, in their
canowes, both men, women, and young infants wrapt in skins,
and hanging at their mothers backs; with whom we had traffique,
for such things as they had, as chaines of certaine shells
and such other trifles; here the Lord gaue vs three dayes to
breath our selues, and to prouide such things as we wanted, albeit
the same was with continuall care, and troubles to auoid
imminent dangers, which the troubled seas and blustering
windes, did euery houre threaten vnto vs.
         But when we seemed to haue stayed there too long, we were

more rigorously assaulted by the not formerly ended, but now
more violently renewed storme; and driuen thence also with no
small danger; leauing behind vs the greater part of our cable
with the anchor; being chased along by the winds, and buffeted
incessantly in each quarter by the seas (which our Generall interpreted,
as though God had sent them of purpose to the end
which ensued) till at length wee fell with the vttermost part of
land towards the South pole, and had certainely discouered how
farre the same doth reach Southward, from the coast of America
aforenamed.
         The vttermost cape or hedland of all these Ilands, stands
neere in 56. deg. without which there is no maine, nor Iland to
be seene to the Southwards: but that the Atlanticke Ocean, and
the South sea, meete in a most large and free scope.
         It hath beene a dreame through many ages, that these Ilands
haue beene a maine, and that it hath beene terra incognita;
wherein many strange monsters liued. Indeed it might truly, before
this time, be called incognota, for howsouer the mappes and
generall descriptions of Cosmographers, either vpon the deceiueable
reports of other men, or the deceitfull imaginations of
themselues (supposing neuer herein to be corrected) haue set it
downe, yet it is true, that before this time, it was neuer discouered,
or certainely knowne by any traueller, that wee haue heard
of.
         And here as in a fit place, it shall not be amisse, to remoue
that error in opinion, which hath beene held by many, of the
impossible returne, out of Mar Del Zur, into the West Ocean;
by reason of the supposed Easterne current, and leuant windes:
which (say they) speedily carrie any thither, but suffer no returne.
They are herein likewise altogether deceiued: for neither
did we meete with any such current, neither had we any such certaine
windes, with any such speed to carry vs through; but at
all times, in our passage there, we found more opportunity to
returne backe againe, into the West Ocean, then to goe forward
into Mar Del zur, by meanes either of current, or windes to

hinder vs, whereof we had experience more then we wished:
being glad oftentimes, to alter our course, and to fall asterne againe,
with francke winde (without any impediment of any
such surmised current) farther in one afternoone, then we could
fetch vp, or recouer againe in a whole day, with a reasonable
gale. And in that they alleage the narrownes of the frete, and
want of sea-roome, to be the cause of this violent current; they
are herein no lesse deceiued, then they were in the other without
reason: for besides, that it cannot be sayd, that there is one
onely passage, but rather innumerable it is most certaine, that
a sea-board all these Ilands, there is one large and maine sea,
wherein if any will not be satisfied, nor belieue the report of our
experience and ey-sight, hee should be aduised to suspend his
iudgement, till he haue either tried it himselfe, by his owne
trauell, or shall vnderstand, by other trauellers, more particulars
to confirme his minde herein.
         Now as wee were fallen to the vttermost part of these Ilands
 Octob. 28. our troubles did make an end, the storme ceased, and
all our calamities (onely the absence of our friends excepted)
were remoued, as if God, all this while, by his secret prouidence,
had lead vs to make this discouery; which being made,
according to his will he stayed his hand, as pleased his maiestie
therein, and refreshed vs as his seruants.
         At these Southerly parts we found the night, in the latter
end of October, to be but 2. houres long: the sunne being yet
aboue 7. degrees distant from the Tropick: so that it seemeth,
being in the Tropick, to leaue very little, or no night at all in
that place.
         There be few of all these Ilands, but haue some inhabitants,
whose manners, apparell, houses, canowes and meanes of liuing,
is like vnto those formerly spoken of, a little before our
departure out of the Straight. To all these Ilands, did our generall
giue one name, to wit Elizabethides.
         
             After two daies stay, which wee made in and about these Ilands,
the 30. of October we set saile; shaping our course right

North west, to coast alongst the parts of Peru (for so the generall
mappes set out the land to lie) both for that we might, with conuenient
speed, full with the height of 30. deg. being the place
appointed, for the rest of our fleete to re-assemble; as also, that
no opportunity might be lost, in the meane time to finde them
out, if it seemed good to God to direct them to vs.
         In this course, we chanced (the next day) with two Ilands,
being as it were store houses, of most liberall prouision of victualls
for vs, of birds; yeelding not onely sufficient and plentifull
store, for vs who were present, but enough, to haue serued all
the rest also, which were absent.
         Thence (hauing furnished our selues to our content) we continued
our course Nouember 1. still Northwest, as wee had
formerly done, but in going on, we soone espied, that we might
easily haue beene deceiued: and therefore casting about,
and steering vpon another point, wee found, that the generall
mappes did erre from the truth, in setting downe the coast of Peru,
for 12. deg. at least to the Northward, of the supposed
straite; no lesse then is the Northwest point of the compasse,
different from the Northeast, perceiuing hereby, that no man,
had euer by trauell, discouered any part of these 12. deg. and
therefore the setters forth of such descriptions, are not to be
trusted; much lesse honored, in their false and fraudulent coniectures;
which they vse, not in this alone, but in diuers other
points of no small importance.
         We found this part of Peru, all alongst to the height of Lima,
which is 12. deg. South of the line, to be mountainous and very
barren, without water or wood, for the most part, except in
certaine places, inhabited by the Spaniards, and few others,
which are very fruitfull and commodious.
         After we were once againe thus fallen with the land, we continually
coasted along, til we came to the height of 37. d. or thereabout:
and finding no conuenient place of abode, nor likelihood
to heare any newes of our ships, we ranne off againe with
an Iland, which lay in sight, named of the Spaniards Mucho, by

reason of the greatnesse and large circuit thereof.
         
             At this Iland comming to anchor, Nouemb. 25. we found it
to be a fruitfull place, and well stored with sundrie sorts of good
things: as sheepe and other cattell, maize, which is a kinde of
graine whereof they make bread, potatoes, with such other
rootes: besides that, it is thought to be wonderfull rich in gold
and to want no good thing for the vse of mans life. The inhabitants
are such Indians, as by the cruell and most extreame dealing
of the Spaniards, haue beene driuen to flie from the maine,
here to releeue and fortifie themselues. With this people, our
Generall thought it meet to haue traffique, for fresh victuals and
water: and for that cause, the very same night of our arriuall
there, himselfe with diuers of his company went ashoare, to
whom the people with great courtesie came downe, bringing
with them such fruits and other victuals as they had, and two
very fat sheepe, which they gaue our Generall for a present. In
recompence whereof, hee bestowed vpon them againe many
good and necessarie things; signifying vnto them, that the end
of his comming was for no other cause but by way of exchange,
to traffique with them for such things as wee needed, and they
could spare: and in particular, for such as they had alreadie
brought downe vnto vs, besides fresh water, which wee desired
of them. Herein they held themselues well contented, and seemed
to be not a little ioyful of our comming: appointing where
we should the next morning haue fresh water at pleasure, and
withall signifying that then also they would bring vs downe such
other things as we desired to serue our turnes.
         
             The next day therefore very early in the morning (all things
being made readie for traffique, as also vessels prepared to bring
the water) our Generall taking great care for so necessarie prouision,
repaired to the shoare againe; and setting aland two of
his men, sent them with their Barricoes to the watering place, assigned
the night before. Who hauing peaceably past on one
halfe of the way, were then with no small violence set vpon by
those traiterous people, and suddenly slaine: And to the end that

our Generall with the rest of his company should not onely be
stayed from rescuing them, but also might fall (if it were possible)
into their hands in like manner, they had layed closely behind
the rockes an ambushment of (as we guessed) about 500.
men, armed and well appointed for such a mischiefe. Who suddenly
attempting their purpose (the rocks being very dangerous
for the boate, and the sea-gate exceeding great) by shooting
their arrowes hurt and wounded euery one of our men, before
they could free themselues, or come to die vse of there weapons
to do any good. The General himself was shot in the face, vnder
his right eye, and close by his nose, the arrow piercing a maruellous
way in, vnder basis cerebri, with no small danger of his life;
besides that, he was grieuously wounded in the head. The rest,
being nine persons in the boate, were deadly wounded in diuers
parts of their bodies, if God almost miraculously had not giuen
cure to the same. For our chiefe Surgeon being dead, and the
other absent by the losse of our vice-admirall, and hauing none
left vs but a boy, whose good will was more then any skill hee
had, we were little better then altogether destitute of such cunning
and helpes as so grieuous a state of so many wounded bodies
did require. Notwithstanding God, by the good aduice of
our Generall, and the diligent putting too of euery mans helpe,
did giue such speedy and wonderfull cure, that we had all great
comfort thereby, and yeelded God the glory thereof.
         The cause of this force and iniurie by these Ilanders, was no
other but the deadly hatred which they beare against their cruell
enemies the Spaniards, for the bloudy and most tirannous oppression
which they had vsed towards them. And therefore with
purpose against them (suspecting vs to bee Spaniards indeed,
and that the rather, by occasion that though command was giuen
to the contrary, some of our men in demanding water, vsed
the Spanish word Aqua)sought some part of reuenge against vs.
         Our Generall notwithstanding he might haue reuenged this
wrong; with little hazard or danger; yet being more desirous to
preserue one of his owne men aliue, then to destroy 100. of his

enemies, committed the same to God: wishing this onely punishment
to them, that they did but know whom they had
wronged, and that they had done this iniurie not to an enemie,
but to a friend, not to a Spaniard, but to an Englishman; who
would rather haue beene a patron to defend them, then any
way an instrument of the least wrong that should haue beene
done vnto them. The weapons which this people vse in their
warres, are arrowes of reeds, with heads of stone, very brittle and
indented??? but darts of a great length, headed with iron or bone.
         The same day that we receiued this dangerous affront, in the
afternoone we set sayle from thence; and because we were now
nigh the appointed height, wherein our ships were to be looked
for, as also the extremity and crasie state of our hurt men aduising
vs to vse expedition, to finde sone conuenient place of repose,
which might afford them some rest, and yeeld vs necessary
supply of fresh victuals for their diet; we bent our course, as the
wind would suffer vs, directly to run in with the maine.  Where
falling with a bay, called Philips Bay, in, 32. deg. or thereabout,
Nouemb. 30. we came to anchor: and foorthwith manned and
sent our boate to discouer what likelihood the place would offer
to affoord vs such things as we stood in need of.
         Our boate doing her vttermost endeuour in a diligent search,
yet after long trauell could find no appearance of hope for reliefe,
either of fresh victuals or of fresh water: huge heards of
wild buffes they might disecrne, but not so much as any signe of
any inhabitant thereabout. Yet in their returne to vs, they descried
within the bay, an Indian with his Canow as he was a fishing:
him they brought aboard our generall, canow and all as he
was in it. A comely personage, and of a goodly stature; his apparell
was a white garment, reaching scarcely to his knees, his
armes and legges were naked; his haire vpon his head verie long;
without a beard, as all the Indians for the most part are. He seemed
verie gentle, of mild and humble nature, being verie tractable
to learne the vse of euery thing, and most gratefull for such
things as our Generall bestowed vpon him. In him we might see

a most liuely patterne of the harmelesse disposition of that people;
and how grieuous a thing it is that they should by any
meanes be so abused as all those are, whom the Spaniards haue
any command or power ouer.
         This man being courteously entertained, and his paines of
comming double required; after we had shewed him, partly by
signes, and partly by such things as we had, what things we needed,
and would gladly receiue by his meanes, vpon exchange
of such things as he would desire; wee sent him away with our
boate and his owne canow (which was made of reed straw) to
land him where he would. Who being landed, and willing our
men to stay his returne, was immediatly met with by two or three
of his friends; to whom imparting his newes, and shewing what
gifts he had receiued, he gaue so great content, that they willingly
furthered his purpose; so that, after certaine houres of our
mens abode there, hee with diuers others (among whom was
their head or Captaine) made their returne; bringing with them
their loadings of such things as they thought would do vs good:
as some hennes, egges, a fat hogge, and such like. All which
(that our men might be without all suspition of all euill to be
meant or intended by them) they sent in one of their canowes,
a reasonable distance from off the shoare, to our boate, the sea-gate
being at that present very great, and their Captaine hauing
sent backe his horse, would needs commit himselfe to the credit
of our men, though strangers, and come with them to our Generall,
without any of his owne acquaintance or countriemen
with him.
         By his comming as we vnderstood, that there was no meane
or way, to haue our necessities relieued in this place; so he offered
himselfe to be our pilote, to a place and that a good harborough,
not farre backe to the Southward againe: where, by
way of traffique, we might haue at pleasure, both water, and
those other things which we stood in need of. This offer our generall
very gladly receiued, and so much the rather, for that the
place intended, was neere about the place appointed, for the

randenoues of our fleete. Omitting therefore our purpose, of
pursuing the buffes formerly spoken of, of which we had otherwise
determined, if possible to haue killed some; this good
newes of better prouision, and more easie to come by, drew vs
away: and so the 5. day after our arriuall, viz.  December 4. we
departed hence, and the next day  December 5. by the willing
conduct of our new Indian Pilote, we came to anchor in the desired
harbor.
         This harbor the Spaniards call valperizo, and the towne adioyning
Saint Iames of Chinli it stands in 35. deg. 40. min.
where albeit we neither met with our ships, not heard of them,
yet there was no good thing which the place afforded, or which
our necessities indeed for the present required, but we had the
same in great abundance: amongst other things we found in
the towne diuerse storehouses of the wines of Chilie; and in
the harbour, a ship called the Captaine of Moriall, or the grand
Captaine of the South, Admirall to the Ilands of Salomon; loaden
for the most part, with the same kinde of liquors: onely there
was besides, a certaine quantity of fine gold of Baldiuia and a
great crosse of gold beset with Emeranlds, on which was nailed
a God of the same mettall, wee spent some time in refreshing
our selues, and easing this ship of so heauy a burthen: and on
the 8. day of the same moneth (hauing in the meane time, sufficiently
stored our selues with necessaries, as wine, bread, bacon
&c. for along season) we set saile, returning backe towards the
line; carrying againe our Indian pilote with vs, whom our generall
bountifully rewarded, and enriched with many good
things, which pleased him exceedingly, and caused him, by the
way, to be landed in the place where he desired.
         Our necessities being thus to our content releeued, our next
care was the regaining (if possible) of the company of our ships,
so long seuered from vs: neither would any thing haue satisfied
bur generall, or vs so well, as the happy meeting, or good newes
of them, this way therefore (all other thoughts for the present
set apart) were all our studies and endeauours bent, how to fit it

so, as that no opportunity of meeting them might be passed
ouer.
         To this end, considering that we could not conueniently
runne in with our ship (in search of them) to euery place, where
was likelihood of being a harbour; and that our boate was too
little, and vnable to carry men enough, to encounter the malice
or treachery of the Spaniards (if we should by any chance
meete with any of them) who are vsed to shew no mercy, where
they may ouermaster; and therefore meaning not to hazard
our selues to their cruell courtesie; we determined, as we coasted
now towards the line, to search diligently for some conuenient
place, where we might, in peace and safety, stay the trimming
of our ship, and the erecting of a pinnace, in which wee
might with better security, then in our boate, and without endangering
of our ship, by running into each creeke, leaue no
place vntried, if happily we might so finde againe our friends
and countrimen.
         For this cause December 19. we entred a bay, not farre to
the Southward of the towne of Cyppo now inhabited by the
Spaniards, in 29. deg 30. min. where hauing landed certaine of
our men, to the number of 14. to search what conueniency
the place was likely to afford, for our abiding there; we were
immediatly descried by the Spaniards, of the towne of Cyppo,
aforesayd, who speedily made out 300. men at least wherof 100.
were Spaniards, euery one well mounted vpon his horse; the
rest were Indians, running as dogs, at their heeles, all naked,
and in most miserable bondage.
         They could not come any way so closely, but God did open
our eyes to see them, before there was any extremity of danger,
whereby our men being warned, had reasonable time to shift
themselues as they could; first from the maine, to a rocke within
the sea; and from thence into their boate: which being ready
to receiue them, conueighed them with expedition, out of the
reach of the Spaniards fury, without the hurt of any man.
         Onely one Richard Miniuy, being ouer bold and carelesse of

his owne safety, would not be intreated by his friends, nor feared
by the multitude of his enemies, to take the present benefit
of his owne deliuery: but chose either to make 300. me?? by outbrauing
of them to become afraide, or else himselfe to die in
the place; the latter of which indeed he did, whose dead body
being drawne by the Indians from the rocke to the shoare, was
there manfully by the Spaniards beheaded, the right hand cut
off, the heart pluct out, all which they carried away in our sight,
and for the rest of his carcase, they caused the Indians to
shoote it full of arrowes, made but the same day, of greene
wood, and so left it to be deuoured of the beastes and foules
but that we went ashoare againe and buried it: wherein as
there appeareth a most extreame and barbarous cruelty, so doth
it declare to the world, in what miserable feare the Spaniard
holdeth the gouernment of those parts; liuing in continuall
dread of forreigne inuasion by strangers, or secret cutting of their
throats, by those whom they kept vnder them in so shamefull
slauery, I meane the innocent and harmelesse Indians. And
therefore they make sure to murther what strangers soeuer they
can come by, and suffer the Indians by no meanes to haue any
weapon longer then they be in present seruice: as appeared by
their arrowes cut from the tree the same day, as also by the
credible report of others who knew the matter to be true. Yea
they suppose they shew the wretches great fauour, when they
do not for their pleasures whip them with cords, and day by day
drop their naked bodies with burning bacon: which is one of
the least cruelties, amongst many, which they vniuersally vse
against that Nation and people.
         This being not the place we looked for, nor the entertainement
such as we desired;  we speedily got hence againe, and Decemb.
20. the next day, fell with a more conuenient harbour, in
a bay somewhat to the Northward of the forenamed Cyppo, lying
in 27. deg. 55. win. South the line.
         In this place we spent some time in trimming of our ship, and
building of our pinnace, as we desired: but still the griefe for the

absence of our friends remained with vs, for the finding of
whom, our generall hauing now fitted all things to his mind, intended
(leauing his ship the meane while at anchor in the bay)
with his pinnace and some chosen men, himselfe to returne
backe to the Southwards againe; to see if happily he might either
himselfe meete with them, or find them in some harbour, or
creeke; or heare of them by any others, whom he might meete
with, with this resolution he set on, but after one daies sayling,
the winde being contrary to his purpose, he was forced, whether
he would or no to returne againe.
         within this bay, during our abode there, we had such abundance
of fish, not much vnlike our Gurnard in England, as no
place had euer afforded vs the like (Cape Blanck onely vpon
the coast of Barbary excepted) since our first setting forth of
Plymmouth, vntill this time, the plenty whereof in this place
was such, that our gentlemen sporting themselues day by day,
with 4. or 5. hookes and lines, in 2. or 3. houres, would take
sometimes 400. sometimes more at one time.
         
             All our businesse being thus dispatched, Ianuary 19. we set
sayle from hence; and the next place that we fell withall,  Ian.
22. was an Iland standing in the same height, with the North
cape of the prouince of Mormorena, at this Iland we found 4.
Indians with their canowes, which tooke vpon them to bring
our men to a place of fresh water, on the foresayd cape; in hope
whereof, our generall made them great cheere (as his manner
was towards all strangers) and set his course by their direction,
but when we came vnto the place, and had trauelled vp a long
way into the land, wee found fresh water indeed, but scarce so
much as they had drunke wine in their passage thither.
         As we sayled along, continually searching for fresh water;
we came to a place called Tarapaca, and landing there we lighted
on a Spaniard who lay asleepe, and had lying by him 13.
barres of siluer, waighing in all, about 4000. Spanish duccatts:
we would not (could wee haue chosen) haue awaked him of his
nappe: but seeing we, against our wills, did him that iniury, we

freed him of his charge, which otherwise perhaps would haue
kept him waking, and so left him to take out (if it pleased him)
the other part of his sleepe, in more security.
         Our search for water still continuing, as we landed againe
not farre from thence, we met a Spaniard with an Indian boy,
driuing 8. Lambes or Peruvian sheepe: each sheepe bare two
leathren bagges, and in each bagge was 50. pound waight of
refined siluer, in the whole 800. waight: we could not indure
to see a gentleman Spaniard turnd carrier so; and therefore
without intreaty, we offered our seruice, and became drouers:
onely his directions were not so perfect, that we could keepe the
way which hee intended; for almost as soone as hee was parted
from vs, we with our new kinde of carriges, were come vnto
our boates.
         Farther beyond this cape fore-mentioned lie certaine Indian
towns, fro?? whence as we passed by, came many of the people in
certaine bawses made of Seales skins; of which two being ioyned
together of a iust length, and side by side, resemble in fashion
or forme a boate: they haue in either of them a small gutt,
or some such thing blowne full of winde; by reason whereof it
floateth, and is rowed very swiftly, carrying in it no small burthen.
In these vpon sight of our ship, they brought store of fish
of diuerse sortes, to traffique with vs, for any trifles wee would
giue them: as kniues, margarites, glasses, and such like, whereof,
men of 60. & 70. yeares old, were as glad as if they had receiued
some exceeding rich commodity; being a most simple and
plaine dealing people. Their resort vnto vs was such, as considering
the shortnesse of the time, was wonderfull to vs to
behold.
         Not farre from this, viz. in 22. deg. 30. min. lay Mormorena,
another great towne of the same people, ouer whom 2. Spaniards
held the gouerment, with these our generall thought meet
to deale; or at least to try their courtesy, whether they would, in
way of traffique, giue vs such things as we needed or no, and
therefore  Ian. the 26. we cast anchor here, we found them (more

for feare then for loue) somewhat tractable, and receiued from
them by exchange many good things, very necessarie for our
vses.
         Amongst other things which we had of them, the sheepe of
the countrey (viz. such as we mentioned before bearing the leatherne
bags) were most memorable. Their height and length
was equall to a pretty cow, and their strength fully answerable,
if not by much exceeding their size or stature. Vpon one of their
backes did sit at one time three well growne and tall men, and
one boy, no mans foot touching the ground by a large foot in
length, the beast nothing at all complaining of his burthen in
the meane time. These sheepe haue neckes like camels; their
heads bearing a reasonable resemblance of another sheepe. The
Spaniards vse them to great profit. Their wooll is exceeding
fine, their flesh good meate, their increase ordinarie, and besides
they supply the roome of horses for burthen or trauell: yea
they serue to carry, ouer the mountaines, maruellous loades, for
300. leagues together, where no other carriage can be made but
by them onely. Hereabout, as also all along, and vp into the
countrey throughout the Prouince of Cusko, the common
ground wheresoeuer it bee taken vp, in euery hundred pound
weight of earth, yeeldeth 25. s. of pure siluer, after the rate of a
crowne an ounce.
         The next place likely to affoord vs any newes of our ships
(for in all this way from the height where wee builded our pinnace,
there was no bay or harbour at all for shipping) was the
port of the towne of Arica, standing in 20. deg. whither we arriued
the 7. of February : This towne seemed to vs to stand in the
most fruitfull soile that we saw all alongst these coasts: both for
that it is situate in the mouth of a most pleasant and fertile vally,
abounding with all good things; as also in that it hath continuall
trade of shipping, as well from Lyma as from all other parts
of Peru. It is inhabited by the Spaniards. In two barks here, we
found some forty and odde barres of siluer (of the bignesse and
fashion of a brickbatte, and in waight each of them about 20.

pounds) of which wee tooke the burthen on our selues to ease
them, and so departed towards Chowley; with which wee fell
the second day following, viz. Febr. 9. and in our way to Lima,
we met with another barke at Ariquipa, which had begun to
loade some siluer and gold, but hauing had (as it seemed from
Arica by land) some notice of our coming, had vnloaden the
same againe before our arriuall. Yet in this our passage we met
another barke loaden with linnen: some of which we thought
might stand vs in some stead, and therefore tooke it with vs.
         
             At Lima we arriued Febr. 15. and notwithstanding the Spaniards
forces, though they had thirtie ships at that present in
harbour there, whereof 17. (most of them the especiall ships in
all the South sea) were fully ready, we entred and anchored all
night in the middest of them, in the Calao: and might haue
made more spoile amongst them in few houres if we had beene
affected to reuenge, then the Spaniard could haue recouered
againe in many yeares. But wee had more care to get vp that
company which we had so long mist, then to recompence their
cruell and hard dealing by an euen requitall, which now wee
might haue tooke. This Lima stands in 12. deg. 30. min. South
latitude.
         Here albeit no good newes of our ships could bee had, yet
got we the newes of some things that seemed to comfort, if not
to counteruaile our trauells thither, as namely, that in the ship
of one Mighell Angell there, there were 1500. barres of plate,
besides some other things (as silkes, linnen, and in one a chest
full of royals of plate) which might stand vs in some stead in the
other ships; aboard whom we made somewhat bold to bid our selues
welcome. Here also we heard the report of some things
that had befallen in & neere Europe, since our departure thence;
In particular of the death of some great personages: as, the king
of Portugall, and both the kings of Morocco and Fesse, dead all
three in one day at one battell: The death of the king of France,
and the Pope of Rome: Whose abhominations as they are in
part cut off from some Christian kingdomes, where his shame

is manifest, so do his vassals and accursed instruments labour by
all meanes possible to repaire that losse, by spreading the same
the further in these parts, where his diuellish illusions and damnable
deceiuings are not knowne. And as his doctrine takes place
any where, so do the manners that necessarily accompanie the
same infinuate themselues together with the doctrine. For as its
true that in all the parts of America, where the Spaniards haue
any gouernment, the poisonous infection of Popery hath spread
it selfe; so on the other side it is as true, that there is no Citie, as
Lima, Panama, Mexico, &c. no towne or village, yea no house
almost in all these Prouinces, wherein (amongst other the like
Spanish vertues) not onely whoredome, but the filthinesse of
Sodome, not to bee named among Christians, is not common
without reproofe: the Popes pardons being more rife in these
parts then they be in any part of Europe, for these filthinesses
whereout he sucketh no small aduantage. Notwithstanding the
Indians, who are nothing neerer the true knowledge of God
then they were afore, abhorre this most filthie and loathsome
manner of liuing; Shewing themselues in respect of the Spaniards,
as the Scythians did in respect of the Grecians: who in their
barbarous ignorance, yet in life and behauiour, did so farre excell
the wise and learned Greekes, as they were short of them in
the gifts of learning and knowledge.
         But as the Pope and Antichristian Bishops labour by their
wicked factors with tooth and naile to deface the glory of God,
and to shut vp in darknesse the light of the Gospell; so God doth
not suffer his name and Religion to be altogether without witnesse,
to the reprouing both of his false and damnable doctrine,
as also crying out against his vnmeasurable and abhominable licentiounesse
of the flesh, euen in these parts. For in this City of
Lima, not two monethes before our comming thither, there
were certaine persons, to the number of twelue apprehended,
examined, and condemned for the profession of the Gospell,
and reproouing the doctrines of men, with the filthie manners
vsed in that City: Of which twelue, sixe were bound to one stake

and burnt, the rest remained yet in prison, to drinke of the same
cup within few dayes. Lastly, here we had intelligence of a certaine
rich ship, which was loaden with gold and siluer for Panama,
that had set forth of this hauen the second of February.
         The very next day therefore in the morning (viz. the 16. of
the said moneth ) wee set sayle, as long as the wind would serue
our turne, and towed our ship as soone as the wind failed; continuing
our course toward Panama, making stay no where, but
hastening all wee might, to get sight if it were possible, of that
gallant ship the Cacafuego, the great glory of the South sea;
which was gone from Lima 14. dayes before vs.
         We fell with the port of Paita in 4. deg. 4o. min.  Feb. 20. with
port Saint Hellen and the riuer and port of Guiaquill,  Febr. 24.
we past the line  the 28. and the first of March  wee fell with cape
Francisco: where, about midday, we descried a sayle a head of
vs, with whom after once we had spoken with her, we lay still in
the same place about sixe dayes; to recouer our breath againe
which we had almost spent with hasty following, and to recall
to mind what aduentures had past vs since our late comming
from Lima; but especially to do Iohn de Anton a kindnesse, in
freeing him of the care of those things with which his ship was
loaden.
         This ship we found to bee the same of which we had heard,
not onely in the Calao of Lima, but also by diuers occasions
afterward (which now we are at leasure to relate, viz. by a ship
which we tooke betweene Lima and Paita: by another which
we took loaden with wine in the port of Paita: by a third loaden
with tackling and implements for ships (besides eightie pound
waight in gold) from Guiaquill. And lastly, by Gabriel Aluarez,
with whom we talked somewhat neearer the line) we found her
to be indeed the Cacafuego: though before we left her, she were
new named by a boy of her owne the Cacaplata. We found in
her some fruite, conserues, sugars, meale and other victuals, and
(that which was the especiallest cause of her heauy and slow
sayling) a certaine quantitie of iewels and precious stones, 13.

chests of ryals of plate; 80. pound waight in gold; 26. tunne of
vncoyned siluer; two very faire gilt siluer drinking boules, and
the like trifles, valued in all at about 360000. pezoes. We gaue
the master a little linnen and the like, for these commodities;
and at the end of sixe dayes we bad farewell and parted. Hee
hastening somewhat lighter then before to Panama, we plying
off to sea, that we might with more leasure consider what
course hence forward were fittest to be taken.
         And considering that now we were come to the Northward
of the line (Cape Francisco standing in the entrance of the bay of
Panama, in 1. deg. of North latitude) and that there was no
likelihood or hope that our ships should be before vs that way
by any meanes: seeing that in running so many degrees from the
Southermost Ila??ds hitherto, we could not haue any signe or notice
of their passage that way, notwithstanding that we had made
so diligent search, and carefull enquirie after them, in euery harbour
or creeke almost as we had done; and considering also that
the time of the yeare now drew on, wherein we must attempt, or
of necessitie wholly giue ouer that action which chiefly our Generall
had determined: namely, the discouery of what passage
there was to be found, about the Northerne parts of America,
from the South sea, into our owne Ocean (which being once
discouered, and made knowne to be nauigable, we should not
onely do our countrie a good and notable seruice, but we also
our selues, should haue a neerer cut and passage home: where
otherwise, we were to make a very long and tedious voyage of it,
which would hardly agree with our good liking, we hauing
beene so long from home already, and so much of our strength
seperated from vs) which could not at all be done, if the opportunity
of time were now neglected: we therefore all of vs willingly
harkened, and consented to our generalls aduice: which
was, first to seeke out some conuenient place, wherein to trimme
our ship, and store our selues with wood and water and other
prouisions, as we could get: and thenceforward to hasten on
our intended journey, for the discouery of the said passage,

through which we might with joy returne to our longed
homes.
         
             From this cape before we set onward March the 7. shaping
our course towards the Iland of Caines, with which we fell
March 16. setling our selues for certaine dayes, in a fresh riuer,
betweene the maine and it; for the finishing of our needfull businesses
as it is aforesaid. While we abode in this place, we felt a
very terrible earthquake, the force whereof was such, that our
ship and pinnace, riding very neere an English mile from the
shoare, were shaken and did quiuer as if it had beene layd on
drie land: we fond here many good commodities which wee
wanted, as fish, fresh water, wood &c. besides Alagartoes,
Munckeyes and the like, and in our iourny hither, we met with
one ship more (the last wee met with in all those coastes) loaden
with linnen, China silke and China-dishes, amongst which wee
found also a Faulcon of gold, handsomly wrought, with a great
emerald set in the brest of it.
         
             From hence we parted the 24. day of the moneth forenamed,
with full purpose to runne the neerest course, as the winde
would suffer vs, without touch of land a long time; and therefore
passed by port Papagaia; the port of the Vale, of the most
rich and excellent balmes of lericho; Quantapico; and diuerse
others: as also certaine gulphes hereabouts, which without intermission,
send forth such continuall and violent windes, that
the Spaniards, though their ships be good, dare not venture
themselues too neere the danger of them.
         Notwithstanding, hauing notice that we should be troubled
with often calmes, and contrary windes, if we cotinued neere
the coast, and did not runne of to sea to fetch the winde; and
that if we did so, we could not then fall with land againe when
we would: our generall thought it needfull, that we should
runne in with some place or other, before our departure from
the coast; to see if happily wee could, by traffique, augment
our prouision of victuals, and other necessaries: that being at
sea, we might not be driuen to any great want or necessitie

albeit wee had reasonable store of good things aboard vs
already.
         The next harbor therefore which we chanced with, on April
15. in 15. deg. 40. min. was Guatulco so named of the Spaniards
who inhabited it, with whom we had some entercourse, to
the supply of many things which we desired, and chiefely bread
&c. And now hauing reasonably, as wee thought prouided
our selues, we departed from the coast of America for the present:
but not forgetting, before we gate a-shipboard, to take
with vs also a certaine pot (of about a bushell in bignesse) full of
ryalls of plate, which we found in the towne: together with a
chaine of gold, and some other iewells, which we intreated a
gentleman Spaniard to leaue behinde him, as he was flying out
of towne.
         
             From Guatulco we departed the day following, viz. Aprill
16. setting our course directly into the sea: whereon we sayled
500. leagues in longitude, to gee a winde: and betweene that
and lune 3. 1400. leagues in all, till we came into 42. deg. of
North latitude, where in the night following, we found such
alteration of heate, into extreame and nipping cold, that our
men in generall, did grieuously complaine thereof; some of
them feeling their healths much impaired thereby, neither was
it, that this chanced in the night alone, but the day following
carried with it, not onely the markes, but the stings and force of
the night going before; to the great admiration of vs all, for
besides that the pinching and biting aire, was nothing altered;
the very roapes of our ship were stiffe, and the raine which fell,
was an vnnatural congealed and frozen substance, so that we seemed
rather to be in the frozen Zone, then any way so neere vnto
the sun, or these hotter climates.
         Neither did this happen for the time onely, or by some sudden
accident, but rather seemes indeed, to proceed from some
ordinary cause, against the which the heate of the sun preuailes
not, for it came to that extremity, in sayling but 2. deg. farther
to the Northward in our course: that though sea-men lack not

good stomaches, yet it seemed a question to many amongst vs,
whether their hands should feed their mouthes, or rather keepe
themselues within their couerts, from the pinching cold that
did benumme them. Neither could we impute it to the tendernesse
of our bodies, though we came lately from the extremitie
of heate, by reason whereof we might be more sensible of the
present cold: insomuch as the dead and sencelesse creatures,
were as well affected with it as our selues, our meate as soone
as it was remooued from the fire, would presently in a manner
be frozen vp; and our ropes and tackling, in few dayes were
growne to that stiffenesse, that what 3. men afore were able
with them to performe, now 6. men with their best strength,
and vttermost endeauour, were hardly able to accomplish:
whereby a sudden and great discouragement seased vpon the
mindes of our men, and they were possessed with a great mislike,
and doubting of any good to be done that way, yet would
not our general be discouraged, but as wel by comfortable speeches,
of the diuine prouidence, and of Gods louing care ouer
his children, out of the scriptures; as also by other good and
profitable perswasions, adding thereto his own cheerfull example,
he so stirred them vp, to put on a good courage, and to
quite themselues like men, to indure some short extremity, to
haue the speedier comfort, and a little trouble, to obtaine the
greater glory; that euery man was throughly armed with willingnesse,
and resolued to see the vttermost, if it were possible, of
what good was to be done that way.
         The land in that part of America, bearing farther out into
the West, then we before imagined, we were neerer on it then
wee were aware; and yet the neerer still wee came vnto it, the
more extremitie of cold did sease vpon vs. The 5. day of Iune,
wee were forced by contrary windes, to run in with the shoare,
which we then first descried; and to cast anchor in a bad bay,
the best roade we could for the present meete with: where wee
were not without some danger, by reason of the many extreme
gusts, and flawes that beate vpon vs; which if they ceased and

were still at any time, immediatly vpon their intermission, there
followed most vile, thicke, and stinking fogges; against which
the sea preuailed nothing, till the gusts of wind againe remoued
them, which brought with them, such extremity and violence
when they came, that there was no dealing or resisting against
them.
         In this place was no abiding for vs; and to go further North,
the extremity of the cold (which had now vtterly discouraged
our men) would not permit vs: and the winds directly bent
against vs, hauing once gotten vs vnder sayle againe, commanded
vs to the Southward whether we would or no.
         From the height of 48. deg. in which now we were, to 38. we
found the land by coasting alongst it to bee but low and reasonable
plaine: euery hill (whereof we saw many, but none verie
high) though it were in Iune, and the Sunne in his neerest approch
vnto them being couered with snow.
         
             In 38 deg. 30. min. we fell with a conuenient and fit harborough,
and Iune 17. came to anchor therein: where we continued
till the 23. day of Iuly following. During all which time,
notwithstanding it was in the height of Summer, and so neere
the Sunne; yet were wee continually visited with like nipping
colds, as we had felt before: insomuch that if violent exercises
of our bodies, and busie imployment about our necessarie labours,
had not sometimes compeld vs to the contrary, we could
very well haue beene contented to haue kept about vs still our
Winter clothes; yea (had our necessities suffered vs) to haue
kept our beds; neither could we at any time in whole fourteene
dayes together, find the aire so cleare as to be able to take the
height of Sunne or starre.
         And here hauing so fit occasion,(notwithstanding it may
seeme to be besides the purpose of writing the history of this our
voyage) we will a little more diligently inquire into the causes
of the continuance of the extreame cold in these parts: as also
into the probabilities or vnlikelihoods of a passage to be found
that way. Neither was it (as hath formerly beene touched) the

tendernesse of our bodies, comming so lately out of the heate,
whereby the poores were opened, that made vs so sensible of the
colds we here felt: in this respect, as in many others, we found
our God a prouident father, and carefull Physitian for vs. We
lacked no outward helpes nor inward comforts, to restore and
fortifie nature, had it beene decayed or weakened in vs; neither
was there wanting to vs the great experience of our Generall,
who had often himselfe proued the force of the burning Zone;
whose aduice alwayes preuailed much to the preseruing of a
moderate temper in our constitutions: so that euen after our
departure from the heate wee alwayes found our bodies not as
sponges, but strong and hardned, more able to beare out cold,
though we came out of excesse of heate, then a number of chamber
champions could haue beene, who lye on their feather-beds
till they go to sea, or rather whose teeth in a temperate aire do
beate in their heads, at a cup of cold Sack and sugar by the fire.
         And that it was not our tendernes, but the very extremitie of
the cold it selfe, that caused this sensiblenes in vs, may the rather
appeare in that the naturall inhabitants of the place (with whom
we had for a long season familiar intercourse, as is to be related)
who had neuer beene acquainted with such heate; to whom the
countrey, ayre, and climate was proper; and in whom custome
of cold was as it were a second nature: yet vsed to come shiuering
to vs in their warme furres; crowding close together body
to body, to receiue heate one of another, and sheltring themselues
vnder a lee bancke, if it were possible, and as often as they
could, labouring to shroude themselues vnder our garments also,
to keepe them warme. Besides how vnhandsome and deformed
appeared the face of the earth it selfe shewing trees without
leaues, and the ground without greennes in those moneths
of Iune and Iuly. The poore birds and foules not daring (as we
had great experience to obserue it) not daring so much as once
to arise from their nests, after the first egge layed, till it with all
the rest be hatched, and brought to some strength of nature, able
to helpe it selfe. Onely this recompence hath nature affoorded

them, that the heate of their owne bodies being exceeding great,
it perfecteth the creature with greater expedition, and in shorter
time then is to be found in many other places.
         As for the causes of this extremity they seeme not to be so
deeply hidden, but that they may at least in part be guessed at:
The chiefest of which we conceiue to be the large spreading of
the Asian and American continent, which (somewhat Northward
of these parts) if they be not fully ioyned, yet seeme they
to come very neere one to the other. From whose high and
snow-couered mountaines, the North and North-west winds
(the constant visitants of those coasts) send abroad their frozen
nimphes, to the infecting of the whole aire with this insufferable
sharpnesse: not permitting the Sunne, no not in the pride
of his heate, to dissolue that congealed matter and snow, which
they haue breathed out so nigh the Sunne, and so many degrees
distant from themselues. And that the North and North-west
winds are here constant in Iune and Iuly, as the North wind alone
is in August and September; we not onely found it by our
owne experience, but were fully confirmed in the opinion thereof,
by the continued obseruations of the Spaniards. Hence
comes the generall squalidnesse and barrennesse of the countrie;
hence comes it, that in the middest of their Summer, the snow
hardly departeth euen from their very doores, but is neuer taken
away from their hils at all; hence come those thicke mists
and most stinking fogges, which increase so much the more, by
how much higher the pole is raised: wherein a blind pilot is as
good as the best director of a course. For the Sunne striuing to
performe his naturall office, in eleuating the vapours out of these
inferior bodies; draweth necessarily abundance of moisture out
of the sea: bat the nipping cold (from the former causes) meeting
and opposing the Sunnes indeuour, forces him to giue ouer
his worke imperfect: and instead of higher eleuation, to leaue in
the lowest region, wandring vpon the face of the earth and waters,
as it were a second sea: through which its owne beames cannot
possibly pierce, vnlesse sometimes when the sudden violence

of the winds doth helpe to scatter and breake through it; which
thing happeneth very seldome, and when it happeneth is of no
continuance. Some of our marriners in this voyage had formerly
beene at Wardhouse, in 72. deg. of North latitude; who yet
affirmed, that they felt no such nipping cold there in the end of
Summer, when they departed thence, as they did here in those
hottest moneths of Iune and Iuly.
         And also from these reasons we coniecture; that either there
is no passage at all through these Northerne coasts (which is
most likely) or if there be, that yet it is vnnauigable. Adde hereunto,
that though we searched the coast diligently, euen vnto
the 48. deg. yet found we not the land, to trend so much as one
point in any place towards the East, but rather running on continually
Northwest, as if it went directly to meet with Asia; and
euen in that height when we had a franke wind, to haue carried
vs through, had there beene a passage, yet we had a smooth and
calme sea, with ordinary flowing and reflowing, which could
not haue beene, had there beene a frete: of which we rather infallibly
concluded then coniectured, that there was none. But to
returne.
         
             The next day after our comming to anchor in the aforesaid harbour,
the people of the countrey shewed themselues; sending
off a man with great expedition to vs in a canow. Who being
yet but a little from the shoare, and a great way from our ship,
spake to vs continually as he came rowing on. And at last at a
reasonable distance staying himselfe, he began more solemnely
a long and tedious oration, after his manner: vsing in the deliuerie
thereof, many gestures and signes; mouing his hands, turning
his head and body many wayes; and after his oration ended,
with great shew of reuerence and submission, returned back
to shoare againe. He shortly came againe the second time in like
manner, and so the third time: When he brought with him (as a
present from the rest) a bunch of feathers, much like the feathers
of a blacke crow, very neatly and artificially gathered vpon a
string, and drawne together into a round bundle, being verie

cleane and finely cut, and bearing in length an equall proportion
one with another; a speciall cognizance (as wee afterwards obserued)
which they that guard their kings person, weare on their
heads. With this also he brought a little basket made of rushes,
and filled with an herbe which they called Tab??h. Both which
being tyed to a short rodde, he cast into our boate. Our Generall
intended to haue recompenced him immediatly with many
good things, he would haue bestowed vpon him: but entring
into the boate to deliuer the same, he could not be drawne to
receiue them by any meanes: saue one hat, which being cast into
the water out of the ship, he tooke vp (refusing vtterly to meddle
with any other thing, though it were vpon a board put off vnto
him) and so presently made his returne. After which time, our
boate could row no way, but wondring at vs as at gods, they
would follow, the same with admiration.
         The 3. day following, viz.  the 21. our ship hauing receiued
a leake at sea, was brought to-anchor neerer the shoare, that
her goods being landed, she might be repaired: but for that
we were to preuent any danger, that might chance against our
safety, our generall first of all landed his men, with all necessary
prouision, to build tents and make a fort for the defence of our
selues and goods: and that wee might vnder the shelter of it,
with more safety (what euer should befall) end our businsse;
which when the people of the country perceiued vs doing, as
men set on fire to war, in defence of their countrie, in great hast
and companies, with such weapons as they had, they came
downe vnto vs; and yet with no hostile meaning, or intent to
hurt vs: standing when they drew neere, as men rauished in
their mindes, with the sight of such things as they neuer had
seene, or heard of before that time: their errand being rather
with submission and feare to worship vs as Gods, then to haue
any warre with vs as with mortall men. Which thing as it did
partly shew it selfe at that instant, so did it more and more manifest
it selfe afterwards, during the whole time of our abode
amongst them. At this time, being willed by signes to lay from

them their bowes and arrowes, they did as they were directed,
and so did all the rest, as they came more and more by companies
vnto them, growing in a little while, to a great number
both of men and women.
         To the intent therefore, that this peace which they themselues
so willingly sought, might without any cause of the breach
thereof, on our part giuen, be continued; and that wee might
with more safety and expedition, end our businesses in quiet;
our Generall with all his company, vsed all meanes possible,
gently to intreate them, bestowing vpon each of them liberally,
good and necessary things to couer their nakednesse, withall signifying
vnto them, we were no Gods but men, and had neede
of such things to couer our owne shame; teaching them to vse
them to the same ends: for which cause also wee did eate and
drinke in their presence, giuing them to vnderstand, that without
that wee could not liue, and therefore were but men as
well as they.
         Notwithstanding nothing could perswade them, nor remoue
that opinion, which they had conceiued of vs, that wee
should be Gods.
         In recompence of those things which they had receiued of vs,
as shirts linnen cloth, &c. they bestowed vpon our generall, and
diuerse of our company, diuerse things, as feathers, cawles of
networke, the quiuers of their arrowes, made of fawne-skins,
and the very skins of beasts that their women wore vpon their
bodies. Hauing thus had their fill of this times visiting and beholding
of vs, they departed with ioy to their houses, which
houses are digged round within the earth, and haue from the
vppermost brimmes of the circle, clefts of wood set vp, and ioyned
close together at the top, like our spires on the steeple of a
Church: which being couered with earth, suffer no water to enter,
and are very warme, the doore in the most part of them,
performes the office also of a chimney, to let out the smoake:
its made in bignesse and fashion, like to an ordinary scuttle in a
ship, and standing slopewise: their beds are the hard ground,

onely with rushes strewed vpon it, and lying round about the
house, haue their fire in the middest, which by reason that the
house is but low vaulted, round and close, giueth a maruelous
reflexion to their bodies to heate the same.
         Their men for the most part goe naked, the women take akinde
of bulrushes, and kembing it after the manner of hempe,
make themselues thereof a loose garment, which being knitte about
their middles, hanges downe about their hippes, and so affordes
to them a couering of that, which nature teaches should
be hidden: about their shoulders, they weare also the skin of a
deere, with the haire vpon it. They are very obedient to their-husbands,
and exceeding ready in all seruices: yet of themselues
offring to do nothing, without the consents, or being called
of the men.
         As soone as they were returned to their houses, they began amongst
themselues a kind of most lamentable weeping & crying
out; which they continued also a great while together, in such
sort, that in the place where they left vs (being neere about 3.
quarters of an English mile distant from them) we very plainely,
with wonder and admiration did heare the same: the women
especially, extending their voices, in a most miserable and dolefull
manner of shreeking.
         Notwithstanding this humble manner of presenting themselues,
and awfull demeanour vsed towards vs, we thought it
no wisedowe too farre to trust them (our experience of former
Infidels dealing with vs before, made vs carefull to prouide against
an alteration of their affections, or breach of peace if it
should happen) and therefore with all expedition we set vp our
tents, and entrenched our selues with walls of stone: that so being
fortified within our selues, we might be able to keepe off the
enemie (if they should so proue) from comming amongst vs
without our good wills: this being quickly finished we went
the more cheerefully and securely afterward, about our other
businesse.
         Against the end of two daies (during which time they had

not againe beene with vs) there was gathered together a great
assembly of men, women, and children (inuited by the report of
them which first saw vs, who as it seemes, had in that time, of
purpose dispersed themselues into the country, to make knowne
the newes) who came now the second time vnto vs, bringing
with them as before had beene done, feathers and bagges of Tob??h
for presents, or rather indeed for sacrifices, vpon this perswasion
that we were Gods.
         When they came to the top of the hill, at the bottome
whereof wee had built our fort, they made a stand; where one
(appointed as their chiefe speaker) wearied both vs his hearers,
and himselfe too, with a long and tedious oration: deliuered
with strange and violent gestures, his voice being extended to
the vttermost strength of nature, and his words falling so thicke
one in the neck of another, that he could hardly fetch his breath
againe: as soone as he had concluded, all the rest, with a reuerend
bowing of their bodies (in a dreaming manner, and long
producing of the same) cryed Oh: thereby giuing their consents,
that all was very true which he had spoken, and that they had vttered
their minde by his mouth vnto vs; which done, the men
laying downe their bowes vpon the hill, and leauing their women
and children behinde them, came downe with their presents;
in such sort, as if they had appeared before a God indeed:
thinking themselues happy, that they might haue accesse
vnto our generall, but much more happy, when they sawe that
he would receiue at their hands, those things which they so willingly
had presented: and no doubt, they thought themselues
neerest vnto God, when they sate or stood next to him: In the
meane time the women, as if they had beene desperate, vsed vnnaturall
violence against themselues, crying and shreeking piteously,
tearing their flesh with their nailes from their cheekes, in
a monstrous manner, the blood streaming downe along their
brests; besides despoiling the vpper parts of their bodies, of
those single couerings they formerly had, and holding their
hands aboue their heads, that they might not rescue their brests

from harme, they would with furie cast themselues vpon the
ground, neuer respecting whether it were cleane or soft, but
dashed themselues in this manner on hard stones, knobby, hillocks,
stocks of wood, and pricking bushes, or what euer else lay
in their way, itterating the same course againe and againe: yea
women great with child, some nine or ten times each, and others
holding out till 15. or 16. times (till their strengths failed them)
exercised this cruelty against themselues: A thing more grieuous
for vs to see, or suffer could we haue holpe it, then trouble to
them (as it seemed) to do it.
         This bloudie sacrifie (against our wils) being thus performed,
our Generall with his companie in the prefence of those
strangers fell to prayers: and by signes in lifting vp our eyes and
hands to heauen, signified vnto them, that that God whom we
did serue, and whom they ought to worship, was aboue: Beseeching
God if it were his good pleasure to-open by some meanes
their blinded eyes; that they might in due time be called to the
knowledge of him the true and euerliuing God, and of Iesus
Christ whom he hath sent, the saluation of the Gentiles. In the
time of which prayers, singing of Psalmes, and reading of certaine
Chapters in the Bible, they sate very attentiuely: and obseruing
the end at euery pause, with one voice still cryed, Oh,
greatly rejoycing in our exercises. Yea they tooke such pleasure
in our singing of Psalmes, that whensoeuer they resorted to vs,
their first request was commonly this, Gna??h, by which they intreated
that we would sing.
         Our General hauing now bestowed vpon them diuers things,
at their departure they restored them all againe; none carrying
with him any thing of whatsoeuer hee had receiued, thinking
themselues sufficiently enriched and happie, that they had found
so free accesse to see vs.
         Against the end of three daies more (the newes hauing the
while spread it self farther, and as it seemed a great way vp into
the countrie) were assembled the greatest number of people,
which wee could reasonably imagine, to dwell within any conuenient

distance round about. Amongst the rest, the king himselfe,
a man of a goodly stature and comely personage attended
with his guard, of about 100. tall and warlike men, this day, viz.
 Iune 26. came downe to see vs.
         Before his comming, were sent two Embassadors or messengers
to our Generall, to signifie that their Hi??h, that is, their king
was coming and at hand. They in the deliuery of their message,
the one spake with a soft and low voice, prompting his fellow;
the other pronounced the same word by word after him,
with a voice more audible: continuing their proclamation (for
such it was) about halfe an houre. Which being ended, they by
signes made request to our Generall, to send something by their
hands to their Hi??h or king, as a token that his comming might
be in peace. Our Generall willingly satisfied their desire; and
they, glad men, made speedy returne to their Hi??h: Neither was
it long before their king (making as princely a shew as possibly
he could) with all his traine came forward.
         In their coming forwards they cryed continually after a
singing manner with a lustie courage. And as they drew neerer
and neerer towards vs, so did they more and more striue to behaue
themselues with a certaine comelinesse and grauity in all
their actions.
         In the forefront came a man of a large body and goodly aspect
bearing the Septer or royall mace (made of a certaine kind
of blacke wood, and in length about a yard and a halfe) before
the king. Whereupon hanged two crownes, a bigger and a lesse,
with three chaines of a maruellous length, and often doubled;
besides a bagge of the herbe Tab??h. The crownes were made of
knitworke, wrought vpon most curiously with feathers of diuers
colours, very artificially placed, and of a formall fashion:
The chaines seemed of a bony substance: euery linke or part
thereof being very little, thinne, most finely burnished, with a
hole pierced through the middest. The number of linkes going
to make one chaine, is in a manner infinite: but of such estimation
it s amongst them, that few be the persons that are admitted

to weare the same: and euen they to whom its lawfull to vse
them, yet are stinted what number they shall vse; as some ten,
some twelue, some twentie, and as they exceed in number of
chaines, so are they thereby knowne to be the more honorable
personages.
         Next vnto him that bare his Scepter, was the king himselfe
with his guard about him: His attire vpon his head was a cawle
of knitworke, wrought vpon somewhat like the crownes, but
differing much both in fashion and perfectnesse of worke; vpon
his shoulders he had on a coate of the skins of conies, reaching
to his wast: His guard also had each coats of the same shape, but
of other skins:some hauing cawles likewise stucke with feathers,
or couered ouer with a certaine downe, which groweth vp in
the countrey vpon an herbe much like our lectuce; which exceeds
any other downe in the world for finenesse, and beeing
layed vpon their cawles by no winds can be remoued: Of such
estimation is this herbe amongst them, that the downe thereof
is not lawfull to be worne, but of such persons as are about the
king (to whom also it is permitted to weare plume of feathers
on their heads, in signe of honour) and the seeds are not vsed but
onely in sacrifice to their gods. After these in their order, did follow
the naked sort of common people; whose haire being long,
was gathered into a bunch behind, in which stucke plumes of
feathers, but in the forepart onely single feathers like hornes,
euery one pleasing himselfe in his owne deuice.
         This one thing was obserued to bee generall amongst them
all; that euery one had his face painted, some which white, some
blacke, and some with other colours, euery man also bringing in
his hand one thing or other for a gift or present: Their traine or
last part of their company consisted of women and children,
each woman bearing against her breast a round basket or two,
hauing within them diuers things, as bagges of Tob??h, a roote
which they call Pet??h, whereof they make a kind of meale, and
either bake it into bread, or eate it raw; broyled fishes like a
pilchard; the seed and downe aforenamed, with such like:
         
            
Their baskets were made in fashion like a deepe boale, and
though the matter were rushes, or such other kind of stuffe, yet
was it so cunningly handled, that the most part of them would
hold water; about the brimmes they were hanged with peeces
of the shels of pearles, and in some places with two or three
linkes at a place, of the chaines forenamed: thereby signifying,
that they were vessels wholly dedicated to the onely vse of the
gods they worshipped: and besides this, they were wrought vppon
with the matted downe of red feathers, distinguished into
diuers workes and formes.
         In the meane time our Generall hauing assembled his men
together (as forecasting the danger, and worst that might fall
our) prepared himselfe to stand vpon sure ground, that wee
might at all times be ready in our owne defence, if any thing
should chance otherwise then was looked for or expected.
         Wherefore euery man being in a warlike readinesse, he marched
within his fenced place, making against their approach a
most warlike shew (as he did also at all other times of their resort)
whereby if they had beene desperate enemies, they could
not haue chosen but haue conceiued terrour and feare, with discouragement
to attempt any thing against vs, in beholding of
the same.
         When they were come somewhat neere vnto vs, trooping
togetehr, they gaue vs a common or a generall salutation: obseruing
in the meane time a generall silence. Whereupon he
who bare the Scepter before the king, being prompted by another
whom the king assigned to that office, pronounced with an
audible and manly voice, what the other spake to him in secret:
continuing, whether it were his oration or proclamation, at the
least halfe an houre. At the close whereof, there was a common
Amen, in signe of approbation giuen by euery person: And the
king himselfe with the whole number of men and women (the
little children onely remaining behind) came further downe the
hill, and as they came set themselues againe in their former
order.
         
            
And being now come to the foot of the hill and neere out
fort, the Scepter bearer with a composed countenance and
stately carriage began a song, and answerable thereunto, obserued
a kind of measures in a dance: whom the king with his guard
and euery other sort of person following, did in like manner sing
and daunce, sauing onely the women who danced but kept silence.
As they danced they still came on: and our Generall perceiuing
their plaine and simple meaning, gaue order that they
might freely enter without interruption within our bulwarke:
Where after they had entred they yet continued their song and
dance a reasonable time: their women also following them with
their wassaile boales in their hands, their bodies bruised, their
faces torne, their dugges, breasts, and other parts bespotted with
bloud, trickling downe from the wounds, which with their nailes
they had made before their comming.
         After that they had satisfied or rather tired themselues in this
manner, they made signes to our Generall to haue him sit down;
Vnto whom both the king and diuers others made seuerall orations,
or rather indeed if wee, had vnderstood them, supplications,
that hee would take the Prouince and kingdome into his
hand, and become their king and patron: making signes that
they would resigne vnto him their right and title in the whole
land, and become his vassals in themselues and their posterities:
Which that they might make vs ind??ed beleeue that it was their
true meaning and intent; the king himselfe with all the rest with
one consent, and with great reuerence, ioyfully singing a song,
set the crowne vpon his head; inriched his necke with all their
chaines; and offering vnto him many other things, honoured
him by the name of Hy??h. Adding thereunto (as it might seeme)
a song and dance of triumph: because they were not onely visited
of the gods (for so they still iudged vs to be) but the great and
chiefe god was now become their god, their king and patron,
and themselues were become the onely happie and blessed people
in all the World.
         These things being so freely offered, our Generall thought

not meet to reiect or refuse the same: both for that he would
not giue them any cause of mistrust, or disliking of him (that being
the onely place, wherein at this present, we were of necessitie
inforced to seeke reliefe of many things) and chiefely, for that
he knew not to what good end God had brought this to passe,
or what honour and profit it might bring to our countrie in
time to come.
         Wherefore in the name and to the vse of her most excellent
maiesty, he tooke the scepter crowne and dignity, of the sayd
countrie into his hand; wishing nothing more, then that it had
layen so fitly for her maiesty to enioy, as it was now her proper
owne, and that the riches and treasures thereof (wherewith in
the vpland countries it abounds) might with as great conueniency
be transported, to the enriching of her kingdome here at
home, as it is in plenty to be attained there: and especially, that
so tractable and louing a people, as they shewed themselues to
be, might haue meanes to haue manifested their most willing
obedience the more vnto her, and by her meanes, as a mother
and nurse of the Church of Christ, might by the preaching of
the Gospell, be brought to the right knowledge, and obedience
of the true and euerliuing God.
         The ceremonies of this resigning, and receiuing of the kingdome
being thus performed, the common sort both of men and
women, leauing the king and his guard about him, with our
generall, dispersed themselues among our people, taking a diligent
view or suruey of euery man; and finding such as pleased
their fancies (which commonly were the youngest of vs) they
presently enclosing them about, offred their sacrifices vnto
them, crying out with lamentable shreekes and moanes, weeping,
and scratching, and tearing their very flesh off their faces
with their nailes, neither were it the women alone which did
this, but euen old men, roaring and crying out, were as violent
as the women were.
         We groaned in spirit to see the power of Sathan so farre preuaile,
in seducing these so harmelesse soules, and laboured by all

means, both by shewing our great dislike, and when that serued
not, by violent withholding of their hands from that madnesse,
directing them (by our eyes and hands lift vp towards heauen)
to the liuing God whom they ought to serue: but so mad were
they vpon their Idolatry, that forcible withholding them wou'd
not preuaile (for as soone as they could get liberty to their
hands againe, they would be as violent as they were before) till
such time, as they when they worshipped, were conueyed from
them into the tents, whom yet as men desides themselues, they
would with fury and outrage seeke to haue againe.
         After that time had a little qualified their madnes, they then
began to shew & make knowne vnto vs their griefes and diseases
which they carried about them, some of them hauing old aches,
some shruncke sinewes, some old soares and canckred vlcers,
some wounds more lately receiued, and the like, in most lamentable
manner crauing helpe and cure thereof from vs: making
signes, that if we did but blowe vpon their griefes, or but touched
the diseased places, they would be whole.
         Their griefes we could not but take pitty on them, and to
our power desire to helpe them: but that (if it pleased God to
open their eyes) they might vnderstand we were but men and
no gods, we vsed ordinary meanes, as lotions, emplaisters, and
vnguents most fitly (as farre as our skills could guesse) agreeing
to the natures of their griefes, beseeching God, if it made for
his glory, to giue cure to their diseases by these meanes. The
like we did from time to time as they resorted to vs.
         Few were the dayes, wherein they were absent from vs, during
the whole time of our abode in that place: and ordinarily
euery third day, they brought their sacrifices, till such time, as
they certainely vnderstood our meaning, that we tooke no pleasure,
but were displeased with them: whereupon their zeale abated,
and their sacrificing, for a season, to our good liking ceased;
not-withstanding they continued still to make their resort
vnto vs in great abundance, and in such sort, that they oft-times
forgate, to prouide meate for their owne sustenance; so that

our generall (of whom they made account as of a father) was
faine to performe the office of a father to them, relieuing them
with such victualls, as we had prouided for our selues, as, Muscles,
Scales, and such like, wherein they tooke exceeding much
content; and seeing that their sacrifices were displeasing to vs,
yet (hating ingratitude) they sought to recompence vs, with
such things as they had, which they willingly inforced vpon vs,
though it were neuer so necessarie or needfull for themselues to
keepe.
         They are a people of a tractable, free, and louing nature, without
guile or treachery; they bowes and arrowes (their only weapons,
and almost all their wealth) they vse very skillfully, but yet
not to do any great harme with them, being by reason of their
weakenesse, more fit for children then for men, sending the arrow
neither farre off, nor with any great force: and yet are the
men commonly so strong of body, that that, which 2. or 3. of
our men could hardly beare, one of them would take vpon his
backe, and without grudging carrie it easily away, vp hill and
downe hill an English mile together: they are also exceeding
swift in running, and of long continuance; the vse whereof is so
familiar with them, that they seldome goe, but for the most
part runne. One thing we obserued in them with admiration:
that if at any time, they chanced to see a fish, so neere the shoare,
that they might reach the place without swimming, they would
neuer, or very seldome misse to take it.
         After that our necessary businesses were well dispatched, our
generall with his gentlemen, and many of his company, made a
journy vp into the land, to see the manner of their dwelling,
and to be the better acquainted, with the nature and commodities
of the country. Their houses were all such as wee haue formerly
described, and being many of them in one place, made
seuerall villages here and there. The inland we found to be farre
different from the shoare, a goodly country, and fruitfull soyle,
stored with many blessings fit for the vse of man: infinite was
the company of very large and fat Deere, which there we sawe

by thousands, as we supposed, in a heard: besides a multitude
of a strange kinde of Conies, by farre exceeding them in number:
their heads and bodies, in which they resemble other Conies,
are but small; his tayle like the tayle of a Rat, exceeding
long;and his feet like the pawes of a Want or Moale; vnder his
chinne, on either side, he hath a bagge, into which he gathereth
his meate, when he hath filled his belly abroade, that he may
with it, either feed his young, or feed himselfe, when he lists
not to trauaile from his burrough: the people eate their bodies,
and make great account of their skinnes, for their kings holidaies
coate was made of them.
         This country our generall named Albion, and that for two
causes; the one in respect of the white bancks and cliffes, which
lie toward the sea: the other, that it might haue some affinity,
euen in name also, with our owne country, which was sometime
so called.
         Before we went from thence, our generall caused to be set vp,
a monument of our being there; as also of her maiesties, and
successors right and title to that kingdome, namely, a plate of
brasse, fast nailed to a great and firme post; whereon is engrauen
her graces name, and the day and yeare of our arriuall
there, and of the free giuing vp, of the prouince and kingdome,
both by the king and people, into her maiesties hands: together
with her highnesse picture, and armes in a piece of sixpence
currant English monie, shewing it selfe by a hole made of purpose
through the plate: vnderneath was likewise engrauen the
name of our generall &c.
         The Spaniards neuer had any dealing, or so much as set a
foote in this country; the vtmost of their discoueries, reaching
onely to many degrees Southward of this place.
         And now, as the time of our departure was perceiued by
them to draw nigh, so did the sorrowes and miseries of this people,
seeme to themselues to increase vpon them; and the more
certaine they were of our going away, the more doubtfull they
shewed themselues, what they might doe; so that we might easily

iudge that that ioy (being exceeding great) wherewith they
receiued vs at our first arriuall, was cleane drowned in their excessiue
sorrow for our departing: For they did not onely loose
on a sudden all mirth, ioy, glad countenance, pleasant speeches,
agility of body, familiar reioycing one with another, and all
pleasure what euer flesh and bloud might bee delighted in, but
with sighes and sorrowings, with heauy hearts and grieued
minds, they powred out wofull complaints and moanes, with
bitter teares and wringing of their hands, tormenting themselues.
And as men refusing all comfort, they onely accounted
themselues as cast-awayes, and those whom the gods were about
to forsake: So that nothing we could say or do, was able to
ease them of their so heauy a burthen, or to deliuer them from
so desperate a straite, as our leauing of them did seeme to them
that it would cast them into.
         Howbeit seeing they could not still enioy our presence, they
(supposing vs to be gods indeed) thought it their duties to intreate
vs that being absent, we would yet be mindfull of them,
and making signes of their desires, that in time to come wee
would see them againe, they stole vpon vs a sacrifice, and set it
on fire erre we were aware; burning therein a chaine and a bunch
of feathers. We laboured by all meanes possible to withhold
or withdraw them but could not preuaile, till at last we fell to
prayers and singing of Psalmes, whereby they were allured immediatly
to forget their folly, and leaue their sacrifice vnconsumed,
suffering the fire to go out, and imitating vs in all our actions;
they fell a lifting vp their eyes and hands to heauen as they
saw vs do.
         
             The 23. of Iuly they tooke a sorrowfull farewell of vs, but being
loath to leaue vs, they presently ranne to the tops of the hils
to keepe vs in their sight as long as they could, making fires before
and behind, and on each side of them, burning therein (as
is to be supposed) sacrifices at our departure.
         Not farre without this harborough did lye certaine Ilands
(we called them the Ilands of Saint Iames) hauing on than plentifull

and great store of Seales and birds, with one of which wee
fell  Iuly 24. whereon we found such prouision as might competently
serue our turne for a While. We departed againe the day
next following, viz.  Iuly 25. And our Generall now considering,
that the extremity of the cold not only continued but increased,
the Sunne being gone farther from vs, and that the wind blowing
still (as it did at first) from the Northwest, cut off all hope of
finding a passage through these Northerne parts, thought it
necessarie to loose no time; and therefore with generall consent
of all, bent his course directly to tunne with the Ilands of the
Moluccas. And so hauing nothing in our view but aire and sea,
without sight of any land for the space of full 68. dayes together,
wee continued our course through the maine Ocean, till
September 30. following, on which day we fell in kenne of certaine
Ilands, lying about eight degrees to the Northward of
the line.
         From these Ilands present'y vpon the discouery of vs, came
a great number of canowes, hauing each of them in some
foure, in some sixe, in some fourteene or fifteene men, bringing
with them Coques, fish, Potatos, and certaine fruites to small
purpose.
         Their canowes were made after the fashion, that the canowes
of all the rest of the Ilands of Moluccas for the most part are:
That is of one tree, hollowed within with great art and cunning,
being made so smooth both within and without, that they bore
a glosse, as if it were a harnesse most finely burnished: A prowe
and sterne they had of one fashion, yeelding inward in manner
of a semicircle, of a great height, and hanged full of certaine
white and glistering sls for brauery: One each side of their canows,
lay out two peeces of timber about a yard and halfe long,
more or lesse according to the capacitie of their boate. At the
ends whereof was fastned crossewise a great cane, the vse whereof
was to keepe their canowes from ouerthrowing, and that they
might be equally borne vp on each side.
         The people themselues haue the neather parts of their eares

cut round or circlewise, hanging downe very low vpon their
cheeks, wherein they hang things of a reasonable weight: the
nailes on the fingers of some of them, were at least an inch long,
and their teeth as blacke as pitch; the colour whereof they vse to
renew by often eating of an herbe, with a kind of powder, which
in a cane they carrie about them to the same purpose. The first
sort and company of those canowes beeing come to our ship
(which then by reason of a scant wind made little way) very subtilly
and against their natures, began in peace to traffique with
vs, giuing vs one thing for another very orderly, intending (as
we perceiued) hereby to worke a greater mischiefe to vs: Intreating
vs by signes most earnestly to draw neerer towards the
shore, that they might (if possible) make the easier prey both of
the ship and vs. But these passing away, and others continually
resorting, wee were quickly able to guesse at them what they
were: For if they receiued any thing once into their hands, they
would neither giue recompence nor restitution of it, but
thought what euer they could finger to bee their owne: Expecting
always with browes of brasse to receiue more, but
would part with nothing: Yea being reiected for their bad dealing,
as those with whom we would haue no more to do, vsing
vs so euilly, they could not be satisfied till they had giuen the attempt
to reuenge themselues, because we would not giue them
whatsoeuer they would haue for nothing: And hauing stones
good store in their canowes, let flie a maine of them against vs.
It was farre from our Generals meaning to requite their malice
by like iniurie. Yet that they might know that be had power to
doe them harme (if he had listed) he caused a great peece to be
shot off not to hurt them but to affright them. Which wrought
the desired effect amongst them, for at the noise thereof, they
euery one leaped out of his canow into the water, and diuing
vnder the keele of their boates, staied them from going any way
till our ship was gone a good way from them. Then they all
lightly recouered into their canowes, and got them with speed
toward the shoare.
         
            
Notwithstanding other new companies (but all of the same
mind) continually made resort vnto vs. And seeing that there
was no good to be got by violence, they put on a shew of seeming
honestie, and offering in shew to deale with vs by way of
exchange; vnder that pretence they cunningly fell a filching of
what they could, and one of them puld a dagger and kniues from
one of our mens girdles, and being required to restore it againe,
he rather vsed what meanes he could to catch at more. Neither
could we at all be to ridde of this vngracious company, till we
made some of them feele some smart as well as terror: and so we
left that place by all passengers to be knowne hereafter by the
name of the Island of Theeues.
         
             Till the third of October wee could not get cleare of these
consorts, but from thence we continued our course without
sight of land till the  16. of the same moneth, when we fell with
foure Ilands standing in 7. deg. 5. min. to the Northward of the
line. We coasted them till the 21. day, and then anchored and
watered vpon the biggest of them called Mindanao.  The 22. of
October as we past betweene two Ilands, about sixe or eight
leagues South of Mindanao, there came from them two canows
to haue talked with vs, and we would willingly haue talked with
them, but there arose so much wind that put vs from them to
the Southwards.  October 25. we passed by the Iland named
Talao in 3. deg. 40. min. we saw to the Northward of it three or
foure other Ilands, Teda, Saeln Saran, (three Ilands so named
to vs by an Indian) the middle whereof stands in 3. deg. we past
the last saue one of thes??? &  the first day of the following moneth
in like manner, we past the Ile Suaro in 1. deg. 50. min, and  the
third of Nouember we came in sight of the Ilands of the Moluccaes
as we desired.
         These are foure high piked Ilands, their names, Tiren??te, Tid??re,
Matchan, Baetchan, all of them very fruitfull, and yeelding
abundance of cloues, whereof wee furnished our selues of as
much as we desired at a very cheape rate. At the East of them
lyes a very great Iland called Gillola.
         
            
We directed our course to haue gone to Tidore but in coasting
along a little Iland belonging to the king of Terenate,  Nouemb.
4. his deputy or Viceroy with all expedition came off to
our ship in a canow, and without any feare or doubting of our
good meaning came presently aboard. Who after some conference
with our Generall, intreated him by any meanes to runne
with Terenate, not with Tidore, assuring him that his king would
be wondrous glad of his comming, and be ready to do for him
what he could, and what our Generall in reason should require:
For which purpose he himselfe would that night bee with his
king to carry him the newes: with whom if he once dealt, he
should find, that as he was a king so his word should stand; wheras
if he dealt with the Portingals (who had the command of
Tidore) he should find in them nothing but deceit and treachery.
And besides that if he went to Tidore before he came to Terenate,
than would his king haue nothing to doe with vs, for he
held the Portingall as an enemy. On these perswasions our Generall
resolued to runne with Terenate, where the next day very
early in the morning we came to anchor: And presently, our General
sent a messenger to the king with a veluet cloake, for a present
and token that his comming should be in peace: and that
he required no other thing at his hands, but that (his victuals
being spent in so long a voiage) he might haue supply from him
by way of traffique and exchange of marchandise (whereof he
had store of diuers sorts) of such things as he wanted. Which
he thought he might be the bolder to require at his hands, both
for that the thing was lawfull, and that he offered him no preiudice
or wrong therein, as also because he was intreated to repaire
to that place by his Viceroy at Mutir, who assured him of
necessarie prouision in such manner as now he required the
same.
         Before this, the Viceroy according to his promise had beene
with the king, signifying vnto him what a mighty Prince and
kingdome we belonged vnto, what good things the king might
receiue from vs, not onely now, but for hereafter by way of

traffique: yea what honour and benefit it might be to him, to be
in league and friendship with so noble and famous a Prince as
we serued: And farther what a discouragement it would be to
the Portugals his enemies to heare and see it: In hearing whereof
the king was so presently moued to the well liking of the matter,
that before our messenger could come halfe the way, he had
sent the Viceroy with diuers others of his Nobles and Councellors
to our Generall, with speciall message that he should not
onely haue what things he needed, or would require with peace
and friendship, but that be would willingly entertaine amitie
with so famous and renowned a Princes as was ours, and that
if it seemed good in her eyes to accept of it, he would sequester
the commodities and traffique of his whole Iland from others,
especially from his enemies the Portugals (from whom he had
nothing but by the sword) and reserue it to the intercourse of
our Nation, if we would embrace it: In token whereof he had
now sent to our Generall his signet, and would within short time
after, come in his owne person with his brethren and Nobles
with boats or canowes into our ship, and be a meanes of bringing
her into a safer harbour.
         While they were deliuering their message to vs, our messenger
was come vnto the Court, who being met by the way by
certaine noble personages, was with great solemnitie conueied
into the kings presence: at whose hands he was most friendly
and graciously entertained, and hauing deliuered his errand together
with his present vnto the king, the king seemed to him to
iudge himselfe blame-worthy, that he had not sooner hasted in
person to present himselfe to our Generall, who came so farre
and from so great a Prince; And presently with all expedition, he
made ready himselfe with the chiefest of all his States and
Councellors to make repaire vnto vs.
         The manner of his comming as it was princely, so truly it seemed
to vs very strange & maruellous: seruing at the present not
so much to set out his owne royall and kingly state (which was
great) as to do honour to her highnesse to whom we belonged;

wherein how willingly he imployed himselfe, the sequell will
make manifest.
         First therefore, before his comming, did he send off 3. great
and large Canowes; in each whereof, were certaine of the greatest
personages that were about him, attired all of them in white
Lawne, or cloth of Calecut, hauing ouer their heads, from one
end of the Canow to the other, a couering of thinne and fine
mats, borne vp by a frame made of reedes, vnder which euery
man sate in order according to his dignity; the hoary heads, of
many of them, set forth the greater reuerence due to their persons,
and manifestly shewed, that the king vsed the aduice of a
graue and prudent Counsell, in his affaires. Besides these, were
diuerse others, young and comely men, a great number attired
in white as were the other, but with manifest differences: hauing
their places also vnder the same couering, but in inferior
order, as their calling required.
         The rest of the men were souldiers, who stood in comely order
round about on both sides; on the outside of whom, againe
did sit the rowers in certaine galleries, which being 3. on each
side all alongst the Canow, did lie off from the side thereof,
some 3. or 4. yards, one being orderly builded lower then the
other: in euery of which galleries was an equall number of
banckes, whereon did sit the rowers, about the number of fourescoure
in one Canow: In the forepart of each Canow, sate two
men, the one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of brasse,
whereon they both at once stroke; and obseruing a due time
and reasonable space betweene each stroake by the sound thereof,
directed the rowers to keepe their stroake with their oares;
as on the contrary, the rowers ending their stroake with a song,
gaue warning to the others to strike againe; and so continued
they their way with maruelous swiftnesse: neither were their
Canowes naked or vnfurnished of warlike munition, they had
each of the??, at least one small cast piece of about a yard in length
mounted vpon a stocke, which was set vpright; besides euery
man except the rowers, had his sword, dagger, and target, and

some of them some other weapons, as, lances, calliuers, bowes,
arrowes, and many darts.
         These Canowes comming neere our ship in order, rowed
round about vs one after another; and the men as they passe by
vs, did vs a kinde of homage with great solemnity, the greatest
personages beginning first, with reuerend countenance and behauiour,
to bow their bodies euen to the ground: which done,
they put our owne messenger aboard vs againe, and signified to
vs, that their king (who himselfe was comming) had sent them
before him, to conduct our ship into a better roade, desiring a
halser to be giuen them forth, that they might employ their
seruice as their king commanded, in towing our ship therewith
to the place assigned.
         The king himselfe was not farre behinde, but he also with 6.
graue and ancient fathers in his Canow approaching, did at
once together with them, yeeld vs a reuerend kinde of obeysance
in farre more humble manner, then was to be expected;
he was of a tall stature, very corpulent and well set together, of
a very princely and gratious countenance; his respect amongst
his owne was such, that neither his Viceroy of Mutir aforenamed,
nor any other of his counsellers, durst speake vnto him
but vpon their knees, not rising againe till they were licenced.
         Whose comming as it was to our generall, no small cause of
goodliking, so was he receiued in the best manner we could, answerable
vnto his state: our ordinance thundred, which wee
mixed with great store of small shot, among which sounding
our trumpets, and other instruments of musick, both of still and
loud noise, where with he was so much delighted, that requesting
our musick to come into the boate, hee ioyned his Canow
to the same, and was towed at least a whole houre together,
with the boate at the sterne of our ship: Besides this, our generall
sent him such presents, as he thought, might both requite
his curtesy already receiued, and worke a farther confirmation,
of that goodliking and friendship already begunne.
         The king being thus in musicall paradise, and enioying that

wherewith he was so highly pleased; his brother named Moro
with no lesse brauery, then any of the rest, accompanied also
with a great number of gallant followers, made the like repaire,
and gaue vs like respect; and his homage done he fell asterne of
vs, till we came to anchor: neither did our generall leaue his
curtesie vnrewarded, but bountifully pleased him also before
we parted.
         The king as soone as we were come to anchor, craued pardon
to be gone, and so tooke leaue, promising vs, that the next
day he would come aboard, and in the meane time would prepare
and send such victualls, as were requisite and necessary for
our prouision.
         Accordingly the same night, and the morrow following, we
receiued what was there to be had, by way of traffique, to wir,
rice in pretty quantity, hennes, sugar canes, imperfect and liquid
sugar, a fruit which they call Figo (Magellane calls it a
figge of a span long, but is no other then that which the Spaniards
and Portingalls haue named Plantanes) Cocoes and a kind of
meale which they call Sago, made of the toppes of certaine
trees, tasting in the mouth like soure curdes, but meltes away
like sugar; whereof they make a kinde of cake which will keepe
good at least 10. yeares; of this last we made the greatest quantity
of our prouision: for a few cloues wee did also traffique,
whereof for, a small matter, wee might haue had greater store,
then we could well tell where to bestow: but our generalls care
was, that the ship should not be too much pestered or annoyed
therewith.
         At the time appointed, our generall (hauing set all things in
order to receiue him) looked for the kings returne, who failing
both in time and promise, sent his brother to make his excuse,
and to intreat our generall to come on shoare; his brother being
the while to remaine aboard, as a pawne for his safe restoring:
our generall could willingly haue consented, if the king
himself had not first broke his word: the consideration whereof,
bred an vtter disliking in the whole company, who by no

meanes would giue consent, he should hazard himselfe, especially,
for that the kings brother had vttered certaine words, in
secret conference with our generall aboard his cabbin, which
bred no small suspition of ill intent; our generall being thus resolued
not to goe ashoare at that time, reserued the Viceroy for
a pledge, and so sent certaine of his gentlemen to the court,
both to accompany the kings brother, and also with speciall
message to the king himselfe.
         They being come somewhat neere vnto the castle, were receiued
by another brother of the kings, and certaine others of
the greatest states, and conducted with great honour towards
the castle, where being brought into a large and faire house,
they saw gathered together a great multitude of people, by supposition
at least 1000. the chiefe whereof, were placed round about
the house, according as it seemed to their degrees and calling,
the rest remained without.
         The house was in forme foure square, couered all ouer with
cloth of diuerse colours, not much vnlike our vsuall pentadoes
borne vpon a frame of reedes, the sides being open from the
groundsell to the couering, and furnished with seates round about:
it seemes it was there councell-house and not commonly
employed to any other vse.
         At the side of this house, next vnto the castle was seated the
chaire of state, hauing directly ouer it, and extending very largely
euery way, a very faire and rich canopy, as the ground also
for some 10. or 12. pases compasse, was couered with cloth
of Arras.
         Whilest our gentlemen attended in this place the comming
of the king, which was about the space of halfe an houre, they
had the better opportunity to obserue these things; as also that
before the kings comming, there were already set threescore noble
graue and ancient personages, all of them reported to be of
the kings priuy Councell: at the neather end of the house were
placed a great company of yong men, comely personage and
attire. With out the house on the right side, stood foure ancient

comely hoare-headed men, cloathed all in red downe to the
ground, but attired on their heads not much vnlike the Turkes;
these they called Romans, or strangers, who lay as lidgiers there
to keepe continuall traffique with this people: there were also
two Turkes one Italian as lidgiers: and last of all one Spaniard,
who being freed by the kings out of the hands of the Portugals,
in the recouering of the Iland, serued him now in stead of a
souldier.
         The king at last comming from the castle, with 8. or 10. more
graue Senators following him, had a very rich canopy (adorned
in the middest with embossings of gold) borne ouer him, and
was garded with 12. lances the points turned downeward: our
men (accompanied with Moro the kings brother) arose to meet
him, and he very gratiously did welcome and entertaine them.
         He was for person, such as we haue before described him, of
lowe voice, temperate in speech, of kingly demeanour, and a
Moore by nation. His attire was after the fashion of the rest of
his countrey, but farre more sumptuous, as his condition and
state required: from the wast to the ground, was all cloth of
gold, and that very rich; his legges bare, but on his feet a paire
of shooes of cordiuant died red: in the attire of his head, were
finely wreathed in diuerse rings of plated gold, of an inch, or an
inch and halfe in breadth, which made a faire and princely shew,
somewhat resembling a crowne in forme; about his necke hee
had a chaine of perfect gold, the linkes very great and onefold
double; on his left hand was a Diamond, an Emerald, a Ruby,
and a Turky, 4, very faire and perfect jewells, on his right hand
in one ring, a big and perfect Turky, and in another ring many
Diamonds of a smaller size, very artificially set and couched
together.
         As thus he sate in his chaire of State, at his right side there
stood a page with a very costly fanne (richly embrodered and beset
with Saphires) breathing & gathering the aire to refresh the
king, the place very hot, both by reason of the sunne, and
the assembly of so great a multitude. After a while our gentlemen

men hauing deliuered their message, and receiued answer, were
licenced to depart, and were safely conducted backe againe, by
one of the chiefe of the kings Councell, who had charge from
the king himselfe to performe the same.
         Our gentlemen obseruing the castle as well as they could,
could not couceiue it to be a place of any great force: two onely
canons they there saw, and those at that present vntrauersable
because vnmounted. These with all other furniture of like sort
which they haue, they haue gotten them from the Portingals, by
whom the castle it selfe was also builded, whiles they inhabited
that place and Iland. Who seeking to settle a tyrannous gouernment
(as in other places so) ouer this people, and not contenting
themselues with a better estate then they deserued (except
they might (as they thought) make sure worke by leauing none
of the royall bloud aliue, who should make challenge to the
kingdome) cruelly murthered the king himselfe (father to him
who now raignes) and intended the like to all his sonnes. Which
cauelty instead of establishing, brought such a shaking on their
vsurped estate, that they were faine, without couenanting to carrie
away goods, munition, or any thing else to quitte the place
and the whole Iland to saue their liues.
         For the present king with his brethren in reuenge of their fathers
murther, so bestirred themselues, that the Portingall was
wholly driuen from that Iland, and glad that he yet keepes footing
in Tidore. These foure yeares this king hath beene increasing,
and was (as was affirmed) at that present, Lord of an hundred
Ilands thereabout; and was euen now preparing his forces
to hazard a chance with the Portingals for Tidore it selfe.
         The people are Moores, whose Religion consists much in certaine
superstitious obseruations of new Moones, and certaine
seasons, with a rigid and strickt kind of fasting. We had experience
hereof in the Viceroy and his retinue, who lay aboard vs all
the time for the most part during our abode in this place: who
during their perscribed time, would neither eate not drinke, not
so much as a cup of cold water in the day (so zealous are they

in their selfe deuised worship) but yet in the night would eate
threetimes, and that very largely. This Terenate stands in 27.
min. North latitude.
         While we rode at anchor in the harbour at Terenate, besides
the natiues there came aboard vs another, a goodly gentleman,
very well accompanied with his interpreter, to view our ship,
and to conferre with our Generall: he was apparelled much after
our manner, most neate and Courtlike: his carriage the most
respectiue, and full of discreet behauiour that euer we had seene;
Hee told vs that he was himselfe but a stranger in those Ilands,
being a naturall of the Prouince of Paghia in China; his name,
Pausaos of the familie of Hombu: of which familie there had 11.
raigned in continuall succession these two hundred yeares, and
king Bonog by the death of his elder brother (who dyed by a fall
from his horse) the rightfull heire of all China, is the twelfth of
this race: he is of 22. yeares of age: his mother yet liuing: he hath
a wife, and by her sonne: he is well beloued, and highly honoured
of all his subjects, and liues in great peace from any feare
of forreine inuasion: but it was not this mans fortune to enioy
his part of this happinesse both of his king and countrey, as hee
most desired.
         For being accused of a capitall crime whereof (through free)
yet he could not euidently make his innocency appeare, and
knowing the peremptory iustice of China, to be irreuocable, if
he should expect the sentence of the Iudges; he before hand
made suite to his king, that it would please him to commit his
trial to Gods prouidence and iudgement, and to that end to permit
him to trauell on this condition, that if the brought not home
some worthy intelligence, such as his Maiestie had neuer had
before, and were most fit to be knowne, and most honorable for
China, he should for euer liue an exile, or else dye for daring to
set foot againe in his owne countrey: for he was assured that the
God of heauen had care of innocency.
         The king granted his suite, and now he had beene three yeares
abroad, and at this present came from Tidore (where he had remained

two moneths) to see the English Generall, of whom he
heard such strange things, and from him (if it pleased God to
afford it) to learne some such intelligence as might make way
for his returne into his countrey: and therefore he earnestly intreated
our Generall, to make relation to him of the occasion,
way, and manner of his coming so far from England thither,
with the manifold occurrences that had happened to him by
the way.
         Our Generall gaue ample satisfaction to each part of his request:
the stranger hearkened with great attention and delight
to his discourse, and as he naturally excelled in memory (besides
his helpe of art to better the same) so he firmely printed it
in his mind, and with great reuerence thanked God, who had so
vnexpectedly brought him, to the notice of such admirable
things. Then fell he to intreate our Generall with many most
earnest and vehement persuasions, that be would be content to
see his countrey before his departure any farther Westward, that
it should be a most pleasant, most honourable, and most profitable
thing for him that he should gaine hereby the notice, and
carrie home the description of one of the most ancient, mightiest
and richest kingdomes in the world. Hereupon he tooke occasion
to relate the number and greatnesse of the Prouinces, with
the rare commodities and good things they yeelded: the number,
statelinesse, and riches of their Cities, with what abundance
of men, victuals, munition, and all manner of necessaries and
delightfull things they were stored with: In particular, touching
ordnance and great gunnes (the late inuention of a scab-shind
Fer amongst vs in Europe) he related that in Suntien (by some
called Quinzai) which is the chiefest Citie of all China, they had
brasse ordnance of all sorts (much easier to be trauersed then
ours were, and so perfectly made that they would hit a shillng)
aboue 2000. yeares agoe. With many other worthy things
which our Generals owne experience (if it would please him to
make triall) would (better then his relation) assure him of. The
brize would shortly serue very fitly to carrie him thither, and he

himselfe would accompanie him all the way. He accounted
himselfe a happie man, that he had but seene and spoken with vs;
the relation of it might perhaps serue him to recouer fauour in
his countrey: but if he could preuaile with our Generall himselfe
to go thither, he doubted not but it would be a meanes of
his great aduancement, and increase of honour with his king:
Notwithstanding our Generall could not on such perswasions
be induced, and to the stranger parted sorrie, that he could not
preuaile in his request, yet exceeding glad of the intelligence he
had learned.
         
             By the ninth of Nouember hauing gotten what prouision the
place could affoord vs, wee then set sayle: and considering that
our ship for want of trimming was now growne foule, that our
caske and vessels for water were much decayed; and that diuers
other things stood in need of reparation: our next care was, how
wee might fall with such a place where with safetie we might a
while stay for the redressing of these inconueniences. The calmenesse
of the winds, which are almost continuall before the comming
of the brize (which was not yet expected) perswaded vs
it was the fittest time that we could take.
         
             With this resolution wee sayled along till Nouember 14. at
what time we arriued at a little Iland (to the Southward of Cel??bes
standing in 1. deg. 40, min. towards the pole antarticke:
which being without inhabitants, gaue vs the better hope of
quiet abode. We anchored and finding the place conuenient
for our purposes (there wanting nothing here which we stood
in need of, but onely water which wee were faine to fetch from
another Iland somewhat farther to the South) made our abode
herefor 26. whole dayes together.
         The first thing we did, we pitched our tents and intrenched
ourselues as strongly as we could vpon the shoare, lest at any
time perhaps we might haue beene disturbed by the inhabitants
of the greater Iland which lay not farre to the Westward of vs;
after we had prouided thus for our security, wee landed our
goods, and had a Smiths forge set vp, both for the making of

some necessarie shipworke, and for the repairing of some ironhooped
caskes, without which they could not long haue serued
our vse: and for that our Smiths coales were all spent long before
this time; there was order giuen and followed for the burning
of charcoale, by which that want might be supplyed.
         We trimd our ship, and performed our other businesses to
our content. The place affording vs not onely all necessaries
(which we had not of our owne before) thereunto, but also
wonderfull refreshing to our wearied bodies, by the comfortable
reliefe and excellent prouision that here we found, whereby
of sickely, weake, and decayed (as many of vs seemed to be before
our comming hither) we in short space grew all of vs to be
strong, lusty, and healthfull persons. Besides this, we had rare
experience of Gods wonderfull wisedome in many rare and admirable
creatures which here we saw.
         The whole Iland is a through growne wood, the trees for the
most part are of large and high stature, very straight and cleane
without bowes, saue onely in the very top. The leaues whereof
are nor much vnlike our broomes in England: Among these
trees, night by night did shew themselues an infinite smarme of
fierie-seeming-wormes flying in the aire, whose bodies (no bigger
then an ordinary flie) did make a shew, and giue such light
as if euery twigge on euery tree had beene a lighted candle: or
as if that place had beene the starry spheare. To these wee may
adde the relation of another almost as strange a creature, which
here we saw, and that was an innumerable multitude of huge
Bats or reare-mice, equalling or rather exceeding a good Henne
in bignesse. They flie with maruellous swiftnesse, but their flight
is very short; and when they light, they hang onely by the
bowes with their backes downeward.
         Neither may wee without ingratitude (by reason of the
special vse we made of them) omit to speake of the huge multitude,
of a certaine kinde of Crayfish, of such a size, that one was
sufficient to satisfie foure hungry men at a dinner, being a very
good and restoratiue meate; the especiall meane (as we conceiued
it) of our increase of health.
         
            
They are as farre as we could perceiue, vtter strangers to the
sea, liuing always on the land, where they worke themselues
earths, as do the conies, or rather they dig great and huge caues,
vnder the rootes of the most huge and monstrous trees, where
they lodge themselues by companies together. Of the same sort
and kind, we found in other places, about the Iland Cel??bes some
that for want of other refuge, when we came to take them, did
clime vp into trees to hide themselues, whether we were enforced
to clime after them, if we would haue them, which wee
would not sticke to do rather then to be without them: this Iland
we called Crab-iland.
         All necessary causes of our staying longer in this place being
at last finished, our generall prepared to be in a readinesse, to
take the first aduantage of the comming of the brize or winde
which we expected; and hauing the day before, furnished our
selues with fresh water from the other Iland, and taken in prouision
of wood and the like: December 12. we put to sea, directing
our course toward the West: the 16. day wee had sight
of the Iland Celebes or Sil??bis, but hauing a bad winde, and being
intangled among many Ilands, incumbred also with many other
difficulties, and some dangers, & at last meeting with a deep bay,
out of which we could not in three daies turne out agnine, wee
could not by any meanes recouer the North of Sil??bis, or continue
on our course farther West, but were inforced to alter
the same toward the South; finding that course also to be both
difficult and very dangerous, by reason of many shoales, which
lay farre off, here and there among the Ilands, insomuch, that in
all our passages from England hitherto, we had neuer more
care to keepe our selues afloate, and from sticking on them: thus
were we forced to beate vp and downe with extraordinary care
and circumspection till Ianuary 9. at which time, we supposed
that we had at last attained a free passage, the land turning euidently
in our sight about to Westward, and the wind being
enlarged, followed vs as we desired with a reasonable gale.
         When loe on a sudden, when we least suspected no shew or

suspition of danger appearing to vs, and we were now sailing
onward with full sailes, in the beginning of the first watch of the
said day at night, euen in a moment our ship was laid vp fast vpon
a desperate shoale, with no other likelihood in appearance,
but that wee with her must there presently perish: there being
no probability how any thing could be saued, or any person
scape aliue.
         The vnexpectednesse of so extreame a danger, presently roused
vs vp to looke about vs, but the more we looked, the lesse
hope we had of getting cleere of it againe, so that nothing now
presenting it selfe to our mindes, but the ghastly appearance of
instant death, affording no respit or time of pausing, called vpon
vs to turne our thoughts another way, to renounce the
world to deny our selues, and to commend our selues into the
mercifull hands of our most gratious God: to this purpose wee
presently fell prostrate, and with ioyned prayers sent vp vnto the
throne of grace, humbly besought almighty God, to extend his
mercy vnto vs in his sonne Christ Iesus; and so preparing as it
were our necks vnto the blocke, we euery minute expected the
small stroake to be giuen vnto vs.
         Notwithstanding that we expected nothing but imminent
death, yet (that we might not seeme to tempt God, by leauing
any second meanes vnattempted which he afforded) presently as
soone as prayers were ended our generall (exhorting vs to haue
the especiallest care of the better part, to wit, the soule, and adding
many comfortable speeches, of the ioyes of that other life,
which wee now alone looked for) incouraged vs all to bestirre
our selues, shewing vs the way thereto by his owne example;
and first of all the pump being well plyed, and the ship freed of
water, we found our leaks to be nothing increased, which
thought it gaue vs no hope of deliuerance, yet it gaue vs some
hope of respit, insomuch, as it assured vs that the bulke was
sound, which truly we acknowledged to be an immediate prouidence
of God alone, insomuch, as no strength of wood and iron
could haue possibly borne so hard and violent a shocke, as our

ship did, dashing herselfe vnder full saile against the rockes, except
the extraordinary hand of God, had supported the
same.
         Our next assay was for good ground and anchor-hold, to sea,
ward of vs (whereon to hale) by which meanes if by any, our generall
put vs in comfort, that there was yet left some hope ro
cleere our selues: in his owne person, he therefore vndertooke
the charge of sounding, and but euen a boates length from the
ship, he found that the bottom could not by any length of line
be reached vnto: so that the beginnings of hope, which wee
were willing to haue conceiued before, were by this meanes
quite dasht againe; yea our misery seemed to be increased, for
whereas at first wee could looke for nothing but a present end,
that expectation was now turned, into the awaiting for a
lingring death, of the two, the farre more fearefull to be chosen:
one thing fell out happily for vs, that the most of our men did
not conceiue this thing, which had they done, they would in all
likelihood haue beene so much discouraged, that their sorrow
would the more disable them, to haue sought the remedy: our
generall with those few others, that could iudge of the euent
wisely, dissembling the same, and giuing in the meane time
cheerfull speeches, and good incouragements vnto the rest.
         For whiles it seemed to be a cleere case, that our ship was so
fast moared, that shee could not stirr; it necessary followed,
that either we were there to remaine on the place with her; or
else leauing her to commit our selues in most poore end helplesse
state, to seeke some other place of stay and refuge, the
better of which two choices, did carry with it the appearance of
worse then 1000. deathes.
         As touching our ship, this was the comfort that shee could
giue vs, that shee her selfe lying there confined already vpon
the hard and pinching rocks, did tell vs plaine, that shee continually
expected her speedy dispatch, as soone as the sea and
windes should come, to be the seuere executioners of that heauy
iudgement, by the appointment of the eternall iudge already

giuen vpon her, who had committed her there to Adamantine
bonds in a most narrow prison, against their comming for
that purpose: so that if we would stay with her, we must perish
with her; or if any by any yet vnperceiueable meanes,
should chance to be deliuered, his escape must needs be a perpetuall
misery, it being farre better to haue perished together,
then with the losse and absence of his friends, to liue in a strange
land: whether a solitary life (the better choice) among wild
beastes, as a bird on the mountaines without all comfort, or among
the barbarous people of the heathen, in intollerable
bondage both of body and minde.
         And put the case that her day of destruction should be deferred,
longer then either reason could perswade vs, or in any likelihood
could seeme possible (it being not in the power of earthly
things, to indure what shee had suffred already) yet could our
abode there profit vs nothing, but increase our wretchednesse,
and enlarge our sorrows, for as her store and victualls were not
much (sufficient to sustaine vs onely some few daies, without
hope of hauing any increase, no not so much as of a cup of cold
water) so must it ineuitably come to passe, that we (as children in
the mothers wombe) should be driuen euen to eate the flesh
from of our owne armes, shee being no longer able to sustaine
vs; and how horrible a thing this would haue proued, is easy by
any one to be perceiued.
         And whither (had we departed from her) should we haue receiued
any comfort; nay the very impossibility of going, appeared
to be no lesse, then those other before mentioned: our
boate was by no meanes able at once, to carry aboue 20. persons
with any safety, and we were 58. in all, the neerest land was six
leagues from vs, and the winde from the shoare directly bent against
vs: or should we haue thought of setting some ashoare,
and after that to haue fetched the rest, there being no place
thereabout without inhabitants, the first that had landed must
first haue fallen into the hand of the enemie, and so the rest in
order, and though perhaps we might escape the sword, yet

would our life haue beene worse then death, not alone in respect
of our wofull captiuity, and bodily mifseries, but most of all in
respectt of our Christian liberty, being to be depriued of all publique
meanes of seruing the true God, and continually grieued
with the horrible impieties and diuellish idolatries of the heathen.
         Our miserie beeing thus manifest, the very consideration
wherof must needs haue shaken flesh and bloud, if faith in Gods
promises had not mightily sustained vs, we past the night with
earnest longings that the day would once appeare, the meane
time we spent in often prayers, and other godly exercises, thereby
comforting our selues; and refreshing our hearts, striuing to
bring our selues to an humble submission vnder the hand of
God, and to a referring our selues wholly to his good will and
pleasure.
         The day therefore at length appearing, and it being almost
full sea about that time, after we had giuen thankes to God for
his forbearing of vs hitherto, and had with teares called vpon
him to blesse our labours; we againe renewed our trauell, to see
if we could now possibly find any anchor-hold, which we had
formerly sought in vaine. But this second attempt proued as
fruitlesse as the former, and left vs nothing to trust to, but prayers
and teares, seeing it appeared impossible that euer the forecast
counsell, pollicie, or power of man could euer effect the deliuery
of our ship, except the Lord onely miraculously should
do the same.
         It was therefore presently motioned, and by generall voice
determined to commend our case to God alone, leauing our
selues wholly in his hand; to spill or saue vs as seeme best to his
gracious wisedome. And that our faith might bee the better
strengthened, and the comfortable apprehension of Gods mercie
in Christ, be more clearely felt; we had a Sermon and the
Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour celebrated.
         After this sweet repast was thus receiued, and other holy exercises
adioyned were ended, lest we should seeme guilty in any

respect for not vsing all lawfull meanes we could inuent; we fell
to one other practise yet vnassayed, to wit, to vnloading of our
ship by casting some of her goods into the sea: which thing as it
was attempted most willingly, so was it dispatched in very short
time. So that euen those things which we before this time, nor
any other in our case could be without, did now seeme as things
onely worthy to be despised, yea we were herein so forward,
that neither our munition for defence, nor the very meale for
sustentation of our liues could find fauour with vs, but euerie
thing as it first came to hand went ouerboard assuring our selues
of this, that if it pleased God once to deliuer vs out of that most
desperate strait wherein we were, he would fight for vs against
our enemies, neither would he suffer vs to perish for want of
bread. But when all was done, it was not any of our endeuours,
but Gods onely hand that wrought our deliuerie; twas he alone
that brought vs euen vnder the very stroake of death; twas he alone
that said vnto vs, Returne againe ye sonnes of men; twas he
alone that set vs at liberty againe, that made vs safe and free, after
that we had remained in the former miserable condition, the
full space of twentie houres, to his glorious name be the euerlasting
praise.
         The manner of our deliuery (for the relation of it will especially
be expected) was onely this. The place whereon we sate
so fast, was a firme rocke in a cleft, whereof it was we stucke on
the larbord side' at low water there was not aboue sixe foote
depth in all on the starbord, within little distance as you haue
heard no bottome to be found, the brize during the whole
time that we thus were stayed, blew somewhat stiffe directly
against out broad side, and so perforce kept the ship vpright: It
pleased God in the beginning of the tyde, while the water was
yet almost at lowest, to slacke the stiffenesse of the wind; and
now out ship who required thirteene foot water to make her
fleet, and had not at that time on the one side aboue seuen at
most, wanting her prop on the other side, which had too long
alreadie kept her vp, fell a heeling towards the deepe water, and

by that meanes freed her keele and made vs glad men.
         This shoale is at least three or foure leagues in length, it lies
in 2. deg. lacking three or foure minutes South latitude. The
day of this deliuerance was the tenth of Ianuary.
         
         Of all the dangers that in our whole voyage we met with, this
was the greatest, but it was not the last as may appeare by what
ensueth. Neither could we indeed for a long season free our
selues from the continuall care and feare of them; nor could we
euer come to any conuenient anchoring, but were continually
for the most pare tost amongst the many Ilands and shoales
(which lye in infinite number round about on the South parts
of Cel??bes) till the eight day of the following moneth.
         
             Ian. 12. being not able to beare our sayles by reason of the
tempest and fearing of the dangers, we let fall our anchors vpon
a shoale in 3. deg. 30. min.  Ian. 14. we were gotten a little farther
South, where at an Iland in 4. deg. 6. min. we againe cast anchor
and spent a day in watering and wooding. After this wee met
with foule weather, Westerly winds, and dangerous shoales for
many dayes together: insomuch that we were vtterly weary of
this coast of Sillebis, thought best to beare with Timor. The
Southermost cape of Sillebis stands in 5. deg. that side the line.
         But of this coast of Sillebis we could not so easily cleare our
selues. The 20. of Ianua. wee were forced to runne with a small
Iland not farte from thence; where hauing sent our boate a good
distance from vs to search out a place where we might anchor:
wee were suddenly enuironed with no small extremities, for
there arose a most violent, yea an intollerable flaw and storme
out of the Southwest against vs, making vs (who were on a lee
shoare amongst most dangerous and hidden shoales) to feare
extreamely not onely the losse of our boate and men, but the
present losse of our selues, our ship and goods, or the casting of
those men whom God should spare into the hands of Infidels.
Which misery could not by any power or industry of ours
haue beene auoided, if the mercifull goodnesse of God had not
(by staying the outragious extremities wherewich we were set

vpon) wrought our present deliuery, by whose vnspeakeable
mercy our men and boate also were vnexpectedly, yet safely, restored
vnto vs.
         Wee gate off from this place as well as we could, and continued
on our course till the 26. day, when the winde tooke vs,
very strong against vs, West and West Southwest, so as that
wee could beare no more saile, till the end of that moneth was
full expired.
         
             February 1. we saw very high land, and as it seemed well inhabited,
we would faine haue borne with it to haue got some succour,
but the weather was so ill, that we could finde no harbour,
and we were very fearefull of aduenturing our selues too farre,
amongst the many dangers which were neere the shoare.  The
third day also we saw a little Iland, but being vnable to beare any
faile, but onely to ly at hull, we were by the storme carried
away, and could not fetch it. February 6. we saw fiue Ilands,
one of them towards the East, and foure towards the West of
vs, one bigger then another, at the biggest of which we cast anchor,
and the next day watred and wooded.
         
             After we had gone hence on February 8. we descried two canowes,
who hauing descried vs as it seemes before, came willingly
vnto vs, and talked with vs, alluring and conducting vs
to their towne not farre off, named Baratiua it stands in 7. deg.
13. min. South the line.
         The people are Gentiles of handsome body, and comely statute,
of ciuill demeanour, very iust in dealing, and courteous
to strangers, of all which we had euident proofe, they shewing
themselues most glad of our coming and cheerfully ready to relieue
our wants, with whatsoeuer their country could afford.
The men goe all naked saue their heads and secret parts, euery
one hauing one thing or other hanging at his eares. Their women
are couered from the middle to the foote, weating vpon
their naked armes bracelets, and that in no small number, some
hauing nine at least vpon each arme, made for the most part of
horne or brasse, whereof the lightest (by our estimation) would
weigh 2. ounces.
         
            
With this people linnen cloth (whereof they make roles for
their heads, and girdles to weare about their loynes) is the best
marchandise and of greatest estimation: They are also much delighted
with Margaretas (which in their language they call Saleta)
and such other like trifles.
         Their Iland is both rich and fruitfull, rich in gold, siluer, copper,
tinne, sulpher, &c. neither are they onely expert to try
those mettalls, but very skillfull also in working of them artificially,
into diuerse formes and shapes, as pleaseth them best.
Their fruites are diuerse likewise and plentifull, as, nutmegges,
ginger, long pepper, limons, cucumbers, cocoes, figoes, sagu,
with diuerse other sorts, whereof we had one in reasonable
quantity, in bignesse forme and huske, much like a bay-berry,
hard in substance, but pleasant in tast, which being sod becometh
soft, and is a most profitable and nourishing meate: of each
of these wee receiued of them, whatsoeuer wee desired for our
need; insomuch that (such was Gods gratious goodnesse to vs)
the old prouerbe was verified with vs, After a storme commeth a
calme, after warre peace, after scarcity followeth plenty;) so that in
all our voyage (Terenate onely excepted) from our departure
out of our owne countrey hitherto, wee found not any where
greater comfort and refreshing, then we did at this time in this
place; in refreshing and furnishing our selues, here we spent 2.
dayes, and departed hence February 10.
         
         When we were come into the height of 8. deg. 4. min,  Feb.
12. in the morning we espied a greene Iland to the Southward;
not long after, two other Ilands on the same side, and a great
one more towards the North: they seemed all to be well inhabited,
bur wee had neither need nor desire to goe to visit them,
and so we past by them.  The 14. day wee saw some other reasonable
bigge Ilands, and  February 16, we past betweene foure or
fiue bigge Ilands more which lay in the height 9. deg. 40. min.
         
             The 18. we cast anchor vnder a little Iland, whence we departed
againe the day following; we wooded here, but other reliefe
except two turtles we receiued none.
         
            
             The 22. day we lost sight of three Ilands on our starboard side,
which lay in to??? deg. and some odde minutes.
         After this, we past on to the Westward without stay or any
thing to be taken notice of, till the 9. of March when in the morning
wee espied land, some part thereof very high in 8. de. 20. m.
South latitude: here we anchored that night, and the next day
weighed againe, and bearing farther North, and neerer the
shoare, we came to anchor the second time.
         
             The eleuenth of March we first tooke in water, and after sent
our boate againe to shoare, where we had traffique with the
people of the country; whereupon the same day, we brought
our ship more neere the towne: and hauing setled our selues
there that night, the next day our generall sent his man ashoare,
to present the king with certaine cloth, both linnen and woollen,
besides some silkes, which hee gladly and thankfully receiued,
and returned rice, cocoes, hennes, and other victualls in
way of recompence. This Iland we found to be the Iland Iaua,
the middle whereof stands in 7. deg. and 30. min. beyond the
equator.
         
             The 13. of March our general himself with many of his gentlemen,
and others went to shoare, and presented the king (of
whom he was ioyfully and louingly receiued) with his musicke,
and shewed him the manner of our vse of armes, by training his
men with their pikes & other weapons, which they had before
him: for the present we were entertained as we desired, and at
last dismissed with a promise of more victuals to bee shortly sent
vs.
         In this Iland there is one chiefe, but many vnder-gouernors,
or petty kings, whom they call Raias, who liue in great familiaritie
and friendship one with another. The 14. day we receiued
victuals from two of them, and the day after that, to wit, the  15.
three of these kings in their owne persons came aboard to see
our Generall, and to view our ship and warlike munition. They
were well pleased with what they saw, and with the entertainement
which we gaue them. And after these had beene with vs,

and on their returne had as it seemes related what they found,
Raia Donan the chiefe king of the whole land bringing victuals
with him for our reliefe: he also the next day after came aboard
vs. Few were the dayes that one or more of these kings did misse
to visit vs, insomuch that we grew acquainted with the names of
many of them, as of Raia Patai??ra, Raia Cabocap??lla, Raia
Mangb??ngo, Ria Bocabarra, Raia Timb??nton: whom our Generall
alwayes entertained with the best cheere that wee could
make, and shewed them all the commodities of our ship, with
our ordnance and other armes and weapons, and the seuerall
furnitures belonging to each, and the vses for which they serued.
His musicke also and all things else whereby he might do
them pleasure, wherein they tooke exceeding great delight with
admiration.
         
             One day amongst the rest, viz, March. 21. Raia Donan comming
aboard vs, in requitall of our musick which was made to
him, presented our generall with his country musick, which
though it were of a very strange kind, yet the sound was pleasant
and delightfull: the same day, he caused an oxe also to be
brought to the waters side, and deliuered to vs, for which he
was to his content rewarded by our Generall, with diuerse sorts
of very costly silks which he held in great esteeme.
         Though our often giuing entertainement in this manner, did
hinder vs much in the speedy dispatching of our businesses, and
made vs spend the more dayes about them, yet here we found
all such conuenient helpes, that to our contents we at last ended
them: the matter of greatest importance which we did (besides
victualing) was the new trimming and washing of our ship,
which by reason of our long voyage was so ouergrowne with a
kind of shell-fish sticking fast vnto her, that it hindred her exceedingly,
and was a great trouble to her sayling.
         The people (as are their kings) are a louing, a very true, and
a iust dealing people. We traffiqued with them for hens, goats,
cocoes, plantons, and other kinds of victuals, which they offered
vs in such plenty that we might haue laden our ship if we had
needed.
         
            
             We tooke our leaues and departed from them the 26. of
March, and set our course West South West, directly towards
the cape of good hope, or Bon Esperance, and continued without
touch of ought, but aire and water,  till die 21. of May, when we
espied land (to with a part of the maine of Africa) in some places
very high, under the latitude of 31. deg. and halfe.
         
             Wee coasted along till Iune 15. on which day, hauing very
faire weather, and the winde at Southeast, wee past the cape itselfe
so neere in sight, that we had beene able with our pieces to
haue shot to land.
         
             Iuly 15. we fell with the land againe about Rio de Sesto, where
we saw many negroes in their boates a fishing, whereof 2. came
very neere vs but we cared not to stay, nor had any talke or dealing
with them.
         
             The 22. of the same moneth, we came to Sierra Leona, and
spent two dayes for watering in the mouth of Tagoine, and then
put to sea againe ; here also we had oisters, and plenty of lemmons,
which gaue vs good refreshing.
         
             We found our selues vnder the Tropick of Cancer August 15.
hauing the winde at Northeast, and we 50. leagues off from the
neerest land.
         
         The 22. day we were in the height of the Canaries.
 And the 26. (which was Monday in the iust and ordinary
reckoning of those that had stayed at home in one place or
countrie, but in our co??putation was the Lords day or Sonday)
we safely with joyfull minds and thankfvll hearts to God, arriued
at Plimoth, the place of our first setting forth after we had spent
2. years 10. moneths and some few odde daies beside, in seeing
the wonders of the Lord in the deep, in discouering so many admirable
things, in going through with so many strange aduentures,
in escaping out of so many dangers, and ouercomming so
many difficulties in this our encompassing of this neather globe,
and passing round about the world, which we haue related.
