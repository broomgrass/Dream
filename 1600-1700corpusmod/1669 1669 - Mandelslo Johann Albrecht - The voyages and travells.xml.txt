               To the Right Worshipful,
The GOVERNOUR and FELLOWSHIP of ENGLISH
MERCHANTS, for discovery of New Trades, in
MUSCOVY, RUSSIA, &c.
               
                  Right Worshipful,
               
               HAd these been the Travels of some private Person,
I should have contented my self with a personal
Dedication thereof. But being the accompt of a
Solemn Embassy, sent to two of the greatest Princes
of Europe and Asia, upon so Publick and Noble a Design
as that of the Silk-Trade, carried on with vast charge and
many difficulties, for several years, the address of my Endeavours
herein is most properly due to that Body of Merchants,
to whom the advancement of our Trade into those
Parts is particularly recommended. It is not unknown to
you, what opposition this Negotiation met withall from the
several Parties therein concern'd; and consequently, you can
best judge, what advantages may be made thereof, in order
to the Interest of this Nation.
               The Travels of particular Persons have their benefit and
delight; but those of Ambassadors have this further recommendation,
that they contain such Discoveries, as having
been made to Them, out of a deference to their Publick and
Sacred Character, were not to be expected by any others, Travelling
only upon a Private Accompt. They were first published

by Adam Olearius, a Person, by his near Relation
to the Embassy, (whereof he was Secretary) his Knowledge
of the Mathematicks, but particularly his Acquaintance
with the Languages of the Countries, through which they
Travell'd, perfectly accomplish'd for a Work of this Nature.
               What he writ of these Travels in his own Language, the
German, was so kindly receiv'd, that it soon after Travell'd
into several others, which gave some encouragement to the
endring of them into English; the more seasonably at this
time, in as much as this Kingdom, especially this City, begins
to disperse its Industrious Inhabitants, and spreads the Wings
of its Trade into the most remote Cantons of the World.
Which that it may do, till its Wealth at home, and Honour
abroad, be so highly improv'd, as that this Corner of the Vniverse
may give Laws to the Noblest parts thereof, shall be
the constant and earnest wish of,
               
                  Right Worshipful, 
                  Your most humbly devoted Servant,
JOHN DAVIES.
               
            
            
               
               TO THE
READER
               HISTORY hath this advantage of Philosophy,
that it instructs more efficaciously; this,
of Romance, that it is more divertive; inasmuch
as Examples make a deeper impression
than Precepts, and Truth Instils
into rational minds a satisfaction, which
they find not in Fables. But Travels
have this over and above, that they do
both incomparably better than History.
For as, on one side, a man, reflecting on the
Policy and Morality of divers Nations, deduces thence useful Lessons
of Prudence, and delightfully surveys the strange Circulations of humane
Nature; so, on the other, he finds the greater divertisement in
the Relations, out of this regard, that he participates of the Pleasure,
which charms the Travellers, but not of the hardships, hazards,
and inconveniences wherewith they are attended.
               The Travels into Muscovy and Persia, publish'd by Adam Olearius,
have been so well receiv'd by such as were able to judge of
the worth of that Piece, that I dare presume, others will take it kindly,
to find, in this Edition, what he had promis'd the World in his
first. The aboad he had made at Moscou and Ispahan, and the knowledge
he had acquir'd of the Language of the Country, had, as he affirmed
then, brought him acquainted with the mysteries of their
Religion; but printing his Book in some hast, he omitted many
things, which he should otherwise have inserted. He hath since
done it at leisure, so fully, that it seems to be quite another Relation,
in as much as, considering this Revision, what is now publish'd is
both a more curious, and more compleat Piece. They will find that

he hath added thereto the Maps of LIVONIA, MVSCOVY, the CASPIAN-SEA,
PERSIA, and the INDIES, and, what may be justly
accounted the greatest curiosity, the Course of the Great River
WOLGA, whereof there had been little seen in these parts before,
and without which, it were impossible to track the Travellors through
all those remote Countries. Besides which, there is, in this Edition
of ours, a Map of CHINA, and several other pieces of Sculpture, for
the further satisfaction and entertainment of the Reader.
               There is no necessity of repeating here what the Preface of the first
Edition entertain'd the Reader withall, concerning the occasion of
the Embassy, sent by the Duke of Holstein into Muscovy and Persia;
the endowments and worth of that great Prince; the noble design he
had fram'd to himself, for carrying on the Silk-Trade by Land; the
difficulties, or rather impossibilities, which happened in the prosecution
thereof; the insolent, rash, and extravagant carriage of the Ambassador
Brugman, his treacherous designs, and unfortunate end:
But I cannot forbear giving some account of the Illustrious Iohn Albert
de Mandelslo, the Heroe, of the Travels into the East-Indies,
which title I give him, in regard there are in his Travels some miraculous
adventures.
               MANDELSLO, a Gentleman well born, had his Education at
the Duke of Holstein's Court, to whom he had been a Page. Hearing
of an Embassy intended for Muscovy and Persia, he would needs be
one in it; and as if he were that Vertuous Man, who looks upon the
whole World as his Country, he would not depant,  he had obtain'd
his Prince's leave, to see the other parts of Asia. During his
aboad at Ispahan, he got acquainted with some English Merchants,
who, speaking to him of the Indies, rais'd in him a desire to go thither.
The King of Persia, to engage his stay at his Court, proffers
him a Pension of ten thousand Crowns; he slights the favour of so
great a Prince, gets on horse-back, with no great Sums about him,
and sets forward on his Journey, with a retinue of three German
Servants, and one Persian, who was to be his Guide and Interpreter,
but forsook him, when he stood in most need of his service and assistance.
It was also a very strange Adventure, which made him
find civil entertainment and hospitality at Surat; made him subsist
at the charge of others; conducted him by Land to the Great Mogul's
Court; brought him safely back again to Surat; preserv'd the
ship he was in after so many tempests near the Cape of Good-Hope;
and miraculously deliver'd him at his first arrival into England,
when he was given over for irrecoverably lost in the very haven, as
may be seen neer the end of his Travels.
               To these Mandelslo had a particular inclination, and knew so well

how to make his advantages thereof, that Olearius himself makes no
difficulty to confess, that he met with, in his Notes, many things,
which might have been added to his Relation, and have found a kind
reception even among the more Curious, had he been as forward to
have his Travels publish'd, as he had been to prosecute them.
But Mandelslo, instead of giving the world that satisfaction, and continuing
with his Friend, who might have further'd him in his design,
left the Court of Holstein, where he found not employment proportionable
to his merit, and betaking himself to another Profession, he
got into a Regiment of Horse, commanded by a German, who, purely
by his Military accomplishments, had rais'd himself to one of the
greatest dignities of France. He had therein the Command of a
Troop, and, being a person of much courage, and endu'd with all
the qualities requisite to the making up of a great man, was likely to
have rais'd himself to a more than ordinary fortune, when coming
to Paris to pass away the Winter, he there died, of the small Pox.
               Being at Surat, in December 1638. he made a kind of Will, concerning
his Papers, which he put before the beginning of his Relation,
wherein he desir'd his Friend Olearius, not to suffer it to be publish'd,
in regard he had not had the leisure to digest it into order, or if he
did, that he would rather regard therein his reputation after his
death, than the friendship they had mutually promis'd one another,
and faithfully improv'd, during the four years of their joynt-Travels.
               Mandelslo was no great Scholar, but could make a shift to understand
a Latin Author, which helpt him much in the attaining of the
Turkish Language, wherein he came to a considerable perfection.
His Friend taught him also the use of the Astrolabe, so that he was
able to take the Longitudes and Latitudes that are in several places
of his Book, and without which it had been impossible for him, to be
much skill'd in Geography, which makes the most considerable
part of this kind of Relations.
               Olearius hath indeed been very much his Friend, not only in reforming
and refining his Style, which could not be very elegant in a
person of his Profession, but also in making several observations and
additions thereto, printing it in Folio, in a very fair character, and
adorning it with several pieces of Sculpture.
               Olearius's kindness to his Friend, in enriching his Relation, with
many excellent remarks, taken out of Emanuel Osorio, Maffaeus, and
the chief Voyages of the Dutch, gave the French Translator thereof,
A de VVicquefort, occasion to augment the said Book with whatever
he found excellent in all those, who have given the best account of
the East-Indies. So that it is to him we are oblig'd for the exact description
of the Province of Guzuratta, the Kingdoms of Pegu, and

Siam, &c. the state of the affairs of Zeilon, Sumatra, Iava, the Molucca's
and Iapan, as also for the Religions of these people. So that
there is, in this Edition of ours, especially as to the Travels of Mandelslo,
a third part more than there is in the largest of the German
Editions.
               The Reader will find therein many things, which will haply seem
incredible to him, as, among others, he may haply be astonish'd at
the wealth of a Governour of Amadabah, and at that of a King of
Indosthan, as also at the vast revenues of the Provinces and Lords of
China and Iapan; but, besides that there is nothing of Romance in all
this, and that there is no comparison to be made between the wealth
of Europe and that of Asia, there are many persons, in France and
England, that will justifie our Relation, though it said much more
than it does.
               I might here trouble the Reader with what I find in the Learned
Isaac Vossius's Observations upon Pomponius Mela (Lib. 3. c. 5. v. 16.
concerning the length and breadth of the Caspian Sea, wherein he
differs from our Author, and prefers the measure of it by our Countryman
Ienkinson, before that of Olearius. But I choose rather to referr
the more critical to the place it self, and leave them to satisfie
their own curiosity, by conferring what is there said by Vossius,
with the account given by Olearius, of the said Sea, pag. 190, 191,
192. of this English Edition of the Travels.
               I hav only this to add that the French Translator, de Wicquefort,
promises the world (if it be not abroad already) a Piece of his own;
which coming out under the authentick name of History, will contain
some thing beyond what may be expected from a Relation.

               The First Book.
               
                  THE Most High and Mighty Prince,163. Frederick, by the Grace of God, Hereditary
Prince of Norway,The occasion of these Travels. Duke of Sleswick and Holstein, of Stormarie and Ditmars,
Count of Oldenburg, &c. having built the City of Frederickstad, in the
Dutchy of Holstein, would settle there the Trade of Silks, the most important,
no doubt,An Embassy sent the King of Persia and Great Duke of Muscovy. of any in Europe. Persia is the Kingdome, which of any in the
World, yeilds most of it, upon which accompt, the said Prince resolv'd to
court the friendship of the Sophy. But in regard there were several reasons, why the Silks could
not be brought home by Sea, and that, to transport them by Land, he stood in need of the permission
of the Czarr, or great Duke of Muscovy, he thought fit in the year 1633. to send a
solemn Embassy to those two great Monarks.
                  He employ'd in this Embassy,The Embassadors. Philip Crusius, a Lawyer and his privy Councellor, and Otton
Brugman, a Marchant of Hamborough, whom he honour'd with the quality  Councellor.
On the 22.OCTOB. of October in the year aforesaid, they departed from Gottorp, the place where Duke
Frederick made his residence, and went to Hamborough, where they took order for their
Voyage.
                  There they entertain'd their retinue,Their retinue. which consisted of 34 persons, and departed thence the
6.NOVEM. of November. The next day they came to Lubeck; the 8. to Tauemund, where the Ambassadors
took into their service an experienc'd Sea-Captain named Michael Cordes, who was to
be their Pilot, especially upon the Caspian Sea.
                  The 9. we took leave of our Friends,They embark. who had come along with us from Hamborough, and
embarqu'd in a Ship called the Fortune, whereof Iohn Muller was Commander. We took
abord along with us Wendelin Sibelist, a Physician, who was going to Muscovy, to be principal
Physician to the Great Duke.
                  We got out of the Haven about 2. in the afternoon, and anchor'd in the Road at 8. fathom
water.Orders for civil behaviour. About 9. at night, the wind South-West, we set sail, and made that night 20. leagues.
The next day, the Ambassadors thought fit to make some particular Orders to be observ'd during
our Voyage, so to prevent the disorders which are but too frequent among those, who ordinarily
leave not their own Country, but out of a hope to live with greater freedom elsewhere;
and to see the execution of them the better performed, they named several Officers,
giving the Secretary of the Embassy the quality of Fiscal, and to Wendelin Sibelist, and Hartman
Gramem, our Physician, that of Assessors. They discharg'd their places well, and Justice was
o duely administred, that at the end of our Voyage, which was but of five dayes, the penalties

came to above 22. Crowns, which were put into the hands of the Captain, with order they
should be equally distributed between the Poor of Riga and Lubeck.
                  The same day,Bornholm. toward evening, we pass'd by the Island of Bornholm, leaving it a good league
on the right hand. That Island is conceiv'd to be distant from Lubeck 40. German Leagues.
The length and breadth of it is neer the same, viz. 3. leagues; it hath a Royal Palace, named
Hammershausen, belonging to the King of Denmark. Towards the North-side of the Island are
the Rocks called Erdholm, well known by reason of the frequent wracks, which make them so
much the more formidable to Mariners in the Autumn, in regard the darkness of the nights
keeps them from being discover'd, and that all about them those that sound meet with no
bottom.
                  The 11. at noon, we were at 56. degrees of latitude, the weather continuing fair; but, towards
night, the wind, still at South-West, rais'd such a tempest, that we were forc'd to take
in all our sails, and go before the wind till the next morning. Those among us who were not us'd
to the Sea,Sea sickness. were so sick, that some vomited blood: but in regard we had the wind a-stern, it's
violence hindred us not from keeping on our course, and making fifteen Leagues that night.
                  Some are of opinion,Its cause. that the stinch of the salt water, corrupting in the sink, is that which
provokes such vomiting. Others, on the contrary, affirm, that it is caused by the violent agitation
of the Ship, which makes the head turn, and the stomack to cast up what is in it. But
certain it is, that both contribute thereto, in as much as if the agitation trouble the brain, the
stinch also offends it, and makes those heart-sick whose smelling is subtile, provoking vomiting,
even without any violent motion, wherever they are, not only at Sea, but also any where else.
Those who conceive, that people are not subject hereto upon Rivers are deceiv'd; for, besides
that experience hath evinc'd the contrary, we have there the same motion, and fresh water being
corrupted, stinks no less than the salt.
                  The 12. we had so great a calm,A Calm. that the Ship being as it were fastnen'd to the same place,
we had the convenience to bring our Musical Instruments upon the deck, to sing a Te Deum, and
to give God thanks for our deliverance, out of the imminent danger we had been in the night
before.
                  About noon the wind came to South,Cap de Demesnes. which carried us to the Cap de Demesnes, in Courland,
where we cast Anchor, and staid all night. The next day 13. the wind West, we weighed Anchor,
doubled the Cape, enter'd into the Bay,Dunemunde. and came, the 14. before the Fort of Dunemunde,
so called, because situated at the mouth of the River Dune, where that River enters the Baltick
Sea, within two leagues of Riga, And forasmuch as the thick mist hindred those of the Fort
from seeing us, we caus'd the Trumpets to sound, to oblige them to send us a Pilot, without
whose assistance we should hardly have got into the Haven. Those who had the oversight of
the Customes, came immediately to search our Ship, but finding no Merchants goods in it, for
which they might challenge ought, they return'd back, and sent us a Pilot, who conducted us
that night as far as before the City of Riga.The Ambassadors come to Riga. The Ambassadours being got ashore, at the entrance
of the City found a coach, which the Governour had sent to meet them: but in regard
they were not far from their Inn, they would make no use of it, and so kept on their way afoot.
                  The 21th. the Magistrate sent his Presents to the Ambassadors,The Magistrat's present. viz. an Ox, some Sheep,
some Poultry, Hares, Patridges, and other Fowl, Wheaten and Ry-Bread, and half a Tun of
Rhenish Wine. The 24th. The Ambassadors entertained, at Dinner, Andrew Erichzon, the
Governour of the City, as also the Magistrate, the principal Minister, who amongst the Lutherans
is look'd upon as a Bishop, and some Officers of the Garrison.
                  During our abode in this City, which was almost five weeks, in expectation the Fens of those
parts should be frozen up, and the snow cover the Way, which we were to Travel in Sledges,
we augmented our retinue with some necessary persons for that great journey, and we had the
leisure to learn the condition of the City, whereof we shall here give a short description.
                  Clytraeus,Riga described. in his History of Saxony, p. 19. says, That the City of Riga was built by Albert
the third, Bp. of Livonia, in the Year 1196. but Alnoul, Abbot of Lubeck, an Author
of the same time (as living under Otho IV.) says, in the continuation of the Chronicle of Helmold,Its foundation.
1. 7. c. 9. that it was built in the year 1189. by Bertold, Abbot of Locken, in the County
of Shauenbourg, in the Diocese of Minden, of the Order of White-Friers, successor to
Menard in the Bishoprick of Livonia,Made an Archbishoprick. the seat whereof he setled at Riga. In the Year 1215.
it was rais'd to an Archbishoprick, and made Metropolitane of all Livonia, Prussia, and Curland.
The Knights of the Espadon, and, afterwards, the Master of the Teutonick Order in
Prussia, have, many times, divided the administration of Justice and the Soveraignty in that
place, with the Archbishop, till that, in consequence of the Reformation of Religion, both
lost the Authority they had in this City. It was forc'd afterwards to have recourse to the
Crown of Poland,Subject to Poland. whose it became by a voluntary rendition, made in the year 1561. occasion'd
by the War with the Muscovite. Since that, Charles, Duke of Sudermania, having usurp'd
the Crown of Sueden, from Sigismond, his Nephew, who had been called to that of
Poland, thought it not enough to fortify himself in the possession of what he had usurped, but

conceiving he might turn into an Offensive War, that which even in the Defensive was criminal,
he enter'd Livonia in the Year 1605. where he besieg'd the City of Riga. He was forc'd
to raise the siege; as also to do the like in the year 1609. but Gustavus Adolphus was so fortunate
as to take it, in the year 1621.Taken by the Suedes. Ever since that time, the Suedes. have been in possession
of it, though without any Title thereto; the Treaty agreed on between the two Crowns in
the year 1635. allowing them the possession of it no longer than till the Peace, which was to
be made between the two Kings, should restore it to it's lawful Prince, or bestow it on him
who was possess'd of it. The Suedes discover how unwilling they would be to restore it, by
the care they took when we were upon our Travels, to carry on the Fortifications thereof.
They consist,Its fortifications. on the land side, of six regular Bastions, with their Half-moons, and their
Counterscarps Palisadoed. It's situation is very pleasant, in a spacions Valley, upon the River
of Dune, which in that place, is a large quarter of a League broad. It is very populous,
and very considerable because of its Commerce, as well with the English and Hollanders, and
the Hansiatick Towns,Its commerce. in Summer time, while the Baltick Sea is Navigable, as with the
Muscovites when the frost and snow can bear Sledges. The Traffick of it is so great, that it
hath almost as many Shops as Houses. All Provisions are very cheap, because there is such an
abundance of all, that an Ox may be bought for three Crowns, a Hog for one, and Fowl and
Venison proportionably, all the Country Peasants thereabouts having the liberty to Hunt,
though they have not any other. Since the last reduction of it, they have no other Religion
there than the Protestant, the Magistrate and Inhabitants being all Lutherans, and so zealous
in their way, that they no less hate those of the Reformation, than they do the Catholicks,
and Muscovites. There is no Inhabitant almost but understands the Highdutch, the Sclavonian,
and Curland Language; but the Magistrate in his publick Acts makes use only of the Highdutch.
The same is used by the Ministers in their Sermons, unless it be that for the meaner sort of
people, who understand not the Highdutch well, there are Sermons made in the Sclavonian
and Curland Language, in two several Churches.
                  Decem. 14.DECEM. we dispatch'd away 35 Sledges,The Ambassadors leave Riga. with part of our Train and Baggage, and the
next day, the Ambassadors follow'd, by the way of Derpt. The 18th we came to Wolmar, a
small Town, distant from Riga 18 leagues, and so ruin'd by the Muscovites and Polanders,
that the Inhabitants, to avoid the injuries of the weather, have been forc'd to make little buildings
of wood upon the ruines of better foundations. The Governour came to meet us, and
entertain'd us kindly.Ermes Castle. The 20th we got six leagues farther, to the Castle of Ermes, belonging
to Colonel De la Barre, who treated us most magnificently.
                  The 21th we got four leagues to the Castle of Halmet,Halmet Castle. Ringen. Come to Derpt. where we saw a young Elk, which
was higher than a Horse, brought to us while we sate at Table. The 22th we got four leagues
further, to the Castle of Ringen; and the 23th we reach'd Derpt or Torpat. This City is within
6 leagues of the Castle of Ringuen, upon the River Eimbec, between the Lakes of Worzero
and Peipis, in the heart of Livonia. Its buildings are very antient, but extremely ruin'd by
the War. The Muscovites, who call it Iuriogored, were possess'd of it, till the year 1230.
in which the Master of the Teutonick Order took it,An Episcopal City. and rais'd it to a Bishoprick. Iohn Basilovits,
Great Duke of Muscovy, retook it the 19th of Iuly 1558. without any resistance,
through a pannick fear of the Bishop, the Nobility and the Inhabitants, who rendred it upon
the first Summons. In the year 1571. Reinold Rose, a Gentleman of the Country, attempted
to put the City into the hands of Magnus, Duke of Holstein, but this design being discovered,
he was cut to pieces by the Muscovites, who thereupon exercis'd all manner of cruelties upon
the Inhabitants of that City, without any distinction of age or sex. It return'd to the Crown
of Poland,Re-united to the Crown-f Poland. Taken by the Suedes. with all the rest of Livonia, by the Peace made between the Great Duke, Iohn Basilovits,
and Stephen Battory, King of Poland, in the year 1582. Iacob de la Garde, General
of the Suedish Army, took it from the Polanders, in the year 1625. since which time the
Suedes have kept it, but by a Clause in the Treaty of 1635. viz. Until it should be otherwise
dispos'd of, according to the event of the present War. The late King of Sueden, Gustavus
Adolphus,An University founded there by the King of Sueden. founded an University there, in the year 1632. at the instance of Iohn Skytte,
whom the said King made Baron of Duderof, and, afterward, Senator of the Crown of Sueden,
as a gratification for the pains he had taken, in laying the first foundations of Learning in
him. But the University is not much known, either for the reputation of its Professors, or
number of its Scholars; there having not been above ten Suedes, and haply as many Finlanders,
who ever could be perswaded, there was any thing to be learnt in those quarters.
               
               
                  Having kept Christmass at Derpt,JANUARY 1634. we left it Dec. 29. and got, the 3d. of Ianuary 1634. to
Narva, where we were forc'd to stay almost six moneths, in expectation of the Suedish Ambassadors,
who were to go along with us to Muscovy. But though we had here, as well as
at Riga, all divertisements imaginable, keeping open house, and having Musick at Meals, the
Ambassadors entertaining all persons of Quality,The Ambassadours come to Narva. and endeavour'd to abate the wearisomness of
our stay there, by banquests, hunting matches, and walking, for which there were dayly appointments
made; yet did that course of life, with the impatience we were in to go on in out

Travels, become in time insupportable to us. Upon which consideration, as also that it was
conceived in a manner impossible the Suedish Ambassadors should come before the Spring; that
then the way between Narva and Novogorod would be very ill for travelling, and that in
the interim our people had daily quarrels with the Souldiers of the Garrison; it was resolved,
that on the 28th. of February,FEBRUARY. Mr. Paul Fleming should be sent away with part of the
Train and Baggage, and that he should goe by Sledges to Novogorod. Dr. Wendelin made use
of that convenience, and so took his way for the City of Mosco. We had had yet another inconvenience,
in that, Provisions failing us, our Pourveyors, who were Muscovites, were
forc'd to go 8 and 10 Leagues from the City to get Fowl and Mutton. And in regard we could
not so soon expect the Suedish Ambassadors, ours went with a retinue of twelve persons to
Reuel,To Reuel. where they were receiv'd with the shooting off the great Guns, complemented, and
entertain'd with Presents, by the Magistrate, the Governour and principal Citizens, who
did us much honour during the stay we made there, which was six weeks. Of Reuel, Narva,
and the rest of Livonia, we shall speak in the ensuing Book.
                  May 10. Philip Scheiding,MAY. Governour of Reuel, named to be Chief of the Embassy which
the Crown of Sueden sent to Muscovy, had information that his Collegues were come to Narva;
so that being ready for his journey, we left Reuel the 15th following, the Governour causing
the Artillery to be discharg'd at our departure. We came to Narva the 18th and within a
League of the City,Return to Narva, and meet the Suedish Ambassadors. met with Colonel Henry Fleming, Eric Gyllenstiern, and Andrew Bureus,
design'd for the Embassy of Muscovy, with a very gallant retinue. The Governour caus'd
all the great Guns to be discharg'd at our entrance, as he had done the first time. The Ambassadors
resolv'd the next day, that to go to Novogorod, they would take the way of Carlelia,
by Sea, or the Lake of Ladoga; whereof they sent notice to the Governour of Novogorod by
an Express, that he might take order for our reception, and that we might not be stay'd upon
the Frontiers. For it is the custom of Muscovy and Persia to make stranger Ambassadors stay
on the Frontiers, till the Governour of the Province hath sent intelligence to the Court of their
arrival, and receiv'd orders from his Soveraign, for their reception and entertainment. The
reason whereof is,The Muscovites and Persians defray Ambassadors charges. that the great Duke of Muscovy, as also the King of Persia, defrays the
charges of the Ambassadours, both as to Provisions and Carriage, from their coming into
their Countreys, and to that end allows them a Conductor, whom the Muscovites call Pristaf,
and the Persians, Mehemander, who provide for their entertainment and conveyance of their
baggage, and have a party of Souldiers for their Convoy.
                  The Suedish Ambassadors, having dispatch'd a Messenger to Novogorod, left Narva the 22th.
of May, by the way of Kapurga, where they made accompt to pas over Whitsuntide, so to
be nearer the Frontiers of Muscovy. In the mean time, we stay'd at Narva; where I had the
curiosity to go, May 24. being Whitsun Eve, to Russian Narva, and there to observe the
Ceremonies of their Anniversary, and their Devotions towards their deceas'd Kinred and
Friends. The Church-yard was full of Muscovite women, who had spread the Graves with
Handkerchers,Anniversary Ceremonies observ'd by the Muscovites for the dead. whereof the Corners were fring'd with silk of several colours, upon which
they had lay'd dishes full of fish broyl'd and fry'd, Custards, Cakes, and painted Eggs. Some
stood; others kneel'd, making divers questions to their Kinred, weeping over their Graves,
and expressing their affliction by dreadful howlings; but with so little attention, that they
slipp'd no occasion of speaking, nor indeed of laughing with those of their acquaintance who
pass'd by. The Priest, attended by his Clerks, walk'd up and down the Church-yard, having
in his hand a Censer, into which he ever and anon cast little pieces of Wax, to cense the Sepulchers.
The women named to him, those of their Kinred and Friends whom they would recommend
to his prayers, pulling him by the surplice to be serv'd one before the other. The
Priest did this devotion very slightly, and with so little attention, that he was but too well
pay'd with the piece of Copper they gave, so far was he from deserving the Provisions they
brought him, which his Clerks had a care to secure for the advantage of their Master.
                  The 26th We did our Devotions,The Ambassadors leave Narva. Gam Fort. and having sent away our baggage, and part of our train,
by water, as far as Neuschans, we left Narva the 28. Colonel Port, Governour of the place,
did us all possible honour at our departure, and accompany'd us to Gam, which is a fortified
place, or rather a Fort, in the Province of Inguermannia, not 12. (as the Baron of Herberstein
says in his travels of Muscovy) but three leagues from Narva, upon a small River called
the torrent of Gam. 'Tis a small place, but encompass'd with a good Wall, and fortified with
five Bastions built of stone, having near it a Village inhabited by Muscovites, but subjects to the
Crown of Sueden.Kapurga. There we took up fresh Horses, which brought us to Kapurga, six leagues
from Gam, whether we got the 29th. Burgislas Rose, Governour of the Fort; received us kindly,
and treated us sumptuously, both that night at Supper, and the next day at Dinner. We
departed the 30th. at three, afternoon, being to Lodge that night at the house of a Bojar, or Muscovite
Lord; but in regard we had still seven Leagues to go, we were forc'd to travel all night,
and could not reach it till three next morning. The Bojar entertain'd us nobly, and gave us the
divertisement of two Trumpets while we were at Dinner. And to honour us the more, as we

riss from Table, he caus'd his Wife and Daughter to come in; they were very rich in Cloaths,
attended by a Gentle-woman or waiting-maid, who was extremely deformed, the more to set
off the beauty of the Ladies,The civility of the Muscovian Ladies. who indeed needed not that foil. They drank each of them a Cup
of Aquavitae, and presented each of them as much to the Ambassadors. This is the greatest honour
the Muscovites think they can do strangers; unless it be, that, to make it a transcendent
civility, they also suffer them to be kiss'd. This civility Count Alexander Slakou did me,
when the Duke my Master sent me since into Muscovy, in the year 1643. in acknowledgement
of the honour he had receiv'd in our Court, during his Exile. This Bojar's name was N. Basilovits.
He was a very handsome person, and of an excellent good humour. He told us he had
been in the Wars of Germany; that in the year 1631. he was at the battel of Leipsig, and shew'd
us the scars of the wounds he had receiv'd there.
                  The last of May, at one afternoon, we took leave of him, and got four Leagues that day,
to Iohannestal,Johannestal. or St. Iohn's Valley, so called from the name of Baron Iohn Skytte, who was
then going to build a little Citie there. There it was we met with the first persecution of Files,
Gnats, and Wasps, which the Fens thereabouts produce in such quantity, that a man hath much
ado to make his party good against them. There we received intelligence, that the Suedish Ambassadours
expected us at Neuschans,JUNE. which caus'd us to be on our way Iune 1. by three in the
morning.Neuschans Ladoga, a Lake. Neuschans, by others called Nie, is a Fort, two Leagues and a half from Iohannesthal,
upon a Navigable River rising out of the Lake Ladoga, discharging it self into the Gulf of
Finland, and serving for a common Frontier between Carlelia and Inguermannia. The Suedish
Ambassadors departed thence after a conference of two hours had with ours.The Ambassadors come to Notebourg. We follow'd them
the next day, Iune 2. and came the same day to Noteburg, where we stay'd above six weeks,
in expectation of the Great Duke's orders for our reception. The Governour of the place, Iohn
Kunemund, cross'd the River in a Boat, made, and cover'd like a Gondole, to come and meet
us. The Suedish Ambassadors kept open house during their stay at Noteburg, and every meal
sent their Mareshall, a place like that of High Steward in the Courts of Germany, and the Gentlemen
of their retinue, to invite and conduct to them the Ambassadors of Holstein.
                  Iune 17. came to Noteburg Mr. Spring,Spiring, a fifth Ambassador from Sueden, a Hollander born, and sometime an Arrasweaver. The Suedish Ambassadors depart Farmer General of the Outland customs of
Sueden and Livonia, one of the Ambassadors design'd from Sueden, for Muscovy. Iune 25. the
Suedish Ambassadors had intelligence that the Weywode or Governour of Novogorod had sent a
Pristaf, to receive them upon the Frontiers, which oblig'd them to depart the next day to go to
Laba. Ours accompany'd them four Leagues from Noteburg, and permitted me to follow the
Suedes even to the Frontier, to see the Ceremonies of their reception. The 27. at four in the
morning, we came to the River which is about 40 paces broad, and, in that place, serves for a
Frontier between Sueden and Muscovy. The Ambassadors having understood, that there were
on the other side of the River seventeen Boats, for their waftage over, sent immediately their
Interpreter to the Pristaf, to desire him to send some of them to bring over the baggage, so to
facilitate their reception. The Pristaf, who was an aged man, made answer, that he durst not
do it, and that they were not to imagine, the expences of one day, which they should not think
much to lose, would be any inconvenience to the Czaar his Master (so the Muscovites call
their Prince) and that he must begin with the reception of the Ambassadors. About noon he
sent to them his Interpreter, with four Musketiers, whom they call Strelits, whereof he had
about thirty to wait on him at this Ceremony, to tell them, that he was ready to give them reception.A Suedish resolution.
One of the Ambassadors made him answer somewhat roundly, yet civilly enough, that
they had been five weeks upon the Frontiers, and that the Pristaf could not take it ill, if they
made him stay one day; That his Collegues being then taking their rest, he could not make
him an absolute answer, and that he should have notice, when they could pass the River with
their convenience. The Ambassadors were indeed asleep, which happen'd as well in regard
they had travell'd all night,The Muscovites sleep after Dinner. as that, being come to the Frontiers of Muscovy, they comply'd
with the custom of the Countrey, where sleep is as necessary after Dinner as in the Night. One
of the Suedish Ambassadors ask'd the Interpreter, when those of Holstein would be receiv'd;
he told him he could not tell, but, as he thought, it would be three weeks first, that is, after
the arrival of the Suedish Ambassadors at Moscou, because the same horses and carriages were
to bring them thither. About 4. afternoon, the Ambassadors gave notice they were ready to
crosse the River, and that the Pristaf had no more to do but to receive them; whereupon they,
with their Interpreter, went into one Boat, and I with some of their Gentlemen into another.
The Pristaf got into another, accompany'd by fifteen Muscovites in very good order; but to
express the greatness of his Prince, the Boat-men, who were instructed how to behave themselves,
put off so slowly that they could hardly quit the shore, forbearing ever and anon to row,
purposely to let the Ambassadors get before, which method was also observ'd by the Boat-man
that carried over the Ambassadors. But Philip Scheiding, perceiving the intention of the Muscovites,
calls to the Pristaf, telling him, that pride was not seasonable at that time, that he
should come forward, and consider, that that kind of proceeding would conduce as little to the
advantage of the Great Duke, as to the disadvantage of their Prince. At last the Boats being all

come to the middle of the River, the Pristaf advanc'd, and read out of a paper, That the Great
Duke and Czaar, Michael Federouits, &c. had ordered the reception of the Ambassadors coming
from the Crown of Sueden,The reception of the Suedish Ambassadors. and that he had given command, they should be provided for,
they and their retinue, with Provisions and all things necessary, till they came to the Citie of
Mosco. After the Ambassadors had answered the Complement, the Pristaf brought them
ashore, and conducted them to a Gentlemans house who was of the quality they call Simbojar,
not far from the River, where they were receiv'd into a little Stove, black as Hell, by reason
of the smoakiness, yet had they then made a fire, never considering the sultriness of the weather,A Muscovian Collation.
which indeed was extreme. They treated the Ambassadors with spic'd bread, some
gobelets of a very strong kind of Aquavitae, and with two sorts of very bad Hydromel. The
Ambassadors only put it to their lips, and having pass'd the Cup from hand to hand, the last
presented it to me, with this commendation, addatur parum sulphuris & fiet potio infernalis.
After this banquet, which lasted about an hour, during which time, the Muscovite Muketiers
gave several volleys such as they were, the Ambassadors and the Pristaf departed; the Suedes
in twelve Boats, and the Muscovites, with Colours and Drum, in three. I return'd to Notebourg,
where our Ambassadors continued three weeks, as the Pristaf had foretold.
                  The Countrey, which the Muscovites call Osinca, about Notebourg, is very pleasant, so
that we wanted no divertisement, especially that of hunting. Within a quarter of a League of
Notebourg are two Isles, distant one from the other, as far as a Musket will carry, both well
stor'd with wood, and so furnish'd with Fowl that our pieces could hardly be at rest for them,
and the Sea-dogs, whereof there is an incredible number in the Lake, found us excellent sport,
when they expos'd themselves to the Sun along the Rocks. We had also the learned and divertive
conversation of Mr. Peter Crusbiorn, who came, during that time, to Notebourg, with a
design to go into Mvscovy, in the quality of Resident from the Crown of Sueden. This place is
situated at 63. degrees,The situation of Notebourg. 30. minutes, at the entrance of the Lake Ladoga, upon an Isle, which
the said Lake makes there in form like a Nut, which gives it the name. The Muscovites had
built it, and encompass'd it with a wall, two fathom and a half thick, against the attempts of
the Suedes, who took it, under the command of Iames de la Garde, after the extremities of the
siege, and a contagious disease had consum'd the whole Garrison to two men, who yet made a
very advantageous Capitulation. The place is pleasant and delightfull, but not healthy, because
of the fresh-water Lakes and Fenns that ly about it. We were extremely troubled there
with a kind of Fly much like those which in Latine are called Pyraustae, whereof there was such
abundance, that many times they depriv'd us of the sight of Heaven, and would not suffer us to
open our eyes. These insects are also very numerous in Carelia, but not neer so much as at
Notebourg.
                  Iuly 16.JULY. Notice was brought us, that a Pristaf, named Simon Andrew Kareckshin, was
come to the Frontiers,The Ambassadors came to Laba. to receive us; so that we put all things in order for our journey, and departed
the 20. for Laba. We were no sooner got thither, but the Pristaf's Interpreter, accompany'd
by a Musketier, came to know, whether the Ambassadors desir'd to be received?
In answer whereto, we asking, whether he would receive us on this side, or in the middle of the
River, as he had receiv'd the Suedish Ambassadors; he told us, we had no more to do but to
pass, and that those Ceremonies were observ'd only with the Suedes, because of the contest
there is between them about the Frontiers.
                  Having pass'd the River,Their reception. we found the Pristaf standing within 8 or 10 paces of the shore, clad
in a long Coat of red Damask. As soon as the Ambassadors had set foot on land, he came towards
us, being still cover'd, till such time as he began to speak. Then he took off his Cap, as
he pronounc'd the Great Duke's name, reading out of a paper these words, His Majestie, the
Czaar, Michael Federouits, Conservator of all the Russians, &c. hath sent me hither, to receive
thee, Philip Crusius, and thee, Otton Brugman, Ambassadors from the Duke of Holstein, and
commanded me to accommodate you and retinue, with Provisions, Carriages Horses, and
what else shall be necessary, till you come to the Citie of Moscou.
                  His Interpreter, whose name was Anthony, spoke High-Dutch so ill, that we had much
ado to understand him. The Ambassadors made answer by their own Interpreter, Iohn Arpenbeck,
who was very well vers'd in the Muscovian Language. This done, The Pristaf gave
the Ambassadours the upper hand, and conducted them to the Inn, through a party of twelve
Musketiers, all Cosaques. The volley they gave us was not so well discharg'd, but that the
Secretary belonging to the Resident of Sueden,Another Muscovian Collation. who came along with us to see the Ceremonies
of our reception, was shot in his Buff-coat. After a collation of Ginger-Bread, Cherries newly
preserv'd, and Aquavitae, we took water again, and embark'd for the continuation of our Voyage.
After we had dined with the Governour of Notebourg, who came along with us thither,
and who treated us that day with several sorts of pleasant drinks, we were dispos'd into seven
Boats.The Ambassadors prosecute their Voyage
                  
                  The 22. we pass'd the Lake Ladoga, which in that place is 12 leagues over. We landed neer
a Monastery called Nauolkus Konsky, where he met with a Monk, who presented us with bread

and dry'd Salmon. The Pristaf who was to bear our charges, ask'd whether he should provide
for us, or that we had rather take the money allow'd by his Majesty for our entertainment, and
have our meat dress'd by our own Cooks. We made choice of the later, according to the custome
of those Ambassadors who go into those parts. So that we bought our provisions our
selves, which we found cheap enough, in comparison to what the Pristaf provided for us. Two
Copecks, which make two sols French, would buy a tame Fowl, and for a peny we had nine
Eggs. We were allow'd every day two Roubles and five Copecks, amounting to four Crowns
five pence, which found us very good fare. After dinner, we embark'd on a River which
brought us to Ladoga,Come to Ladoga. which is distant from Laba 17 leagues, whither we came the same night.
We met by the way a Pristaf, going to meet the Suedish Resident, with three Boats. In all
our Travels had we not seen so many Children under 7 years of age, as we found at Ladoga.
Some of ours being gone to take the Air, they run after us, having Goosberies to sell, whereof
we bought a hatful for a Copeck. 'Twas pleasant to see those Children, to the number of fifty
together, leaping about us, as we lay on the grass to eat our Goosberries, so dress'd as that we
could not distinguish the Boies from the Girls, for both had their hair cut all off, excepting only
two mustaches, which were suffer'd to grow at their Temples, and were clad in shirts reaching
to their ancles. Our Physician would needs make a discovery of sexes among them, and having
caught one of the Children by the shirt, it happened to be a Boy, who told him laughing,
Deske niet, that he was no Girl, and thereupon pointed to some that were.
                  The 23. at dinner,The Musick of Muscovy. was the first time we heard any of the Country Musick, which consisted
of a Lute and Violin, with some voices, singing aires to the honour of their Czaar, Michael Federouits,
and perceiving they were permitted, they fell a-dancing after a strange manner. The
men and women danc'd much after the same manner, every one alone, making strange faces,
with as strange gesticulations; the motions of the hands, shoulders, and hips, being more violent
than those of the feet, which they do but gently stir, not moving as it were from the same
place. The women have commonly handkerchers in their hands, fring'd with silk of divers colours,
which they cast about their heads.
                  After dinner we embark'd upon the River Wolgda.Wolgda. Our Musketiers, or Strelits, begg'd the
benediction of a Monk that happen'd to be by the River side; it being their custom to beg it of
all Monks,The devotion of the Muscovites. and in all the Churches they come to by the way, which if they have not the time to
go into, they think it enough to do reverences to the Crosses they see upon the Churches and
Chapels, pronouncing these words, Hospodi Buchmilo, that is to say, Lord be merciful to me.
                  The wind being with us, it was thought fit we should make use of our sails, but, the Muscovites
being not the most expert Mariners, one of the Ropes broke, and the sail falling on one of
the Musketiers, struck him down so as that we gave him over for dead, but coming to himself
again within an hour after, and having taken a considerable dram of the Aquavitae bottle, he was
as well as ever.
                  The Wolgda is as broad as Elbe,Wolgda described. but runs much more slowly. It rises neer great Novogorod, out
of the Lake called the Lake of Ilmen, and falls into that of Ladoga. Seven werstes (whereof five
make a German League) from Ladoga,A dangerous fall of water. there is a strange fall of Water in that River, and about
a league and a half thence, another, where the water falls with such violence, that it runs like a
shaft, amidst the many Rocks scatter'd up and down neer those places: in so much that to draw
the loaden Boats up the River, there needs above a hundred men. We got ashore at the former,
and saw our Boats pass safely, all save the last, in which we had left Simon Frisius, a Merchant's
Son of Hamborough, who being extremely sick was forc'd to stay in it. This Boat being drawn
up to the highest pitch of the water, the rope broke, so that the water forc'd it back with such
violence, that it would have split against the Rocks, if, by an unexpected good hap, one end of
the rope, which was fasten'd to the mast, had not twin'd it self about one of the Rocks, by
which means the Boat was stay'd??? till we had the convenience to dis-engage it. There we were
told, that a certain Bishop, coming that way in a Boat laden with Fish, had been cast away some
few dayes before. The other fall we pass'd without any danger, and came that night to a Convent,
called Nicolai Nepostiza, where we took up our quarters, and stay'd the next day, expecting
the Boats that were coming after us.
                  From Reuel to Moscou,Troublesome Flies and other insects. are nothing but Woods, Fenns, Lakes and Rivers, which produce
such abundance of Flies, Gnats, and Wasps, that people have much ado to keep them off, in so
much, that, in the night time, they are forc'd to wrap themselves up in certain linnen cloaths,
such as Travellers make use of in Livonia and Muscovy: those among us who had not been carefull
to cover themselves, having their faces so sported, as if they were newly recover'd from the
small pox. The Wagoners and Conntry people, who have not convenience enough of those
cloaths, are forc'd to make use of fire against the importunity of those Insects; insomuch that
Muscovy being every where well furnish'd with wood, they make good fires, and lye down by
them;The Presents of a Muscovian Monk. all which hinders not but that they are extremely troubled with them.
                  There were but four Monks in the Convent; the most aged among them made us a Present of
Turneps, pickled Cowcumbers, some green Pease, and two wax candles. We gratify'd him

with a Crown piece, which he took so kindly, that he let us into his Church, contrary to the
Custom of the Country, and put on his Sacerdotal Vestments, that we might see them. He
shew'd us, in the Portal, the Miracles of S. Nicholas, painted according to the mode of the
Country, very roughly, and without proportion. Upon the door was represented the last
Judgement, wherein the Monk pointed to a Man habited after the German fashion, and told
us,The Muscovites do not condemn those of a contrary belief. That the Germans and other Nations were not uncapable of Salvation, provided they had
a Muscovite Soul, and that they lived justly in the sight of God. He shew'd us also a Bible in
his own Language (for no Muscovite knows any other than his own and the Sclavonian) and
read to us the first Chapter of S. Iohn's Gospel, which we found absolutely conformable to our
Text. To which he added, that being once at Reuel, he had there had a conference with some
of our Pastors, concerning the Holy Scripture; but that he could give them no great satisfaction,
because he did not well understand the German Interpreter. He would have shewn us all
the Church, but our Musketiers coming in grumbled at it, and reproach'd him for having communicated
too much to us. We gave him the tother Crown, for which he gave us many thanks,
bowing his head to the very ground, and smiting it with his forehead. We intended to have
made our repast upon the grass, but were hardly set, ere the wind turning for us, the
Monk brings us another prefent of Turneps and Cowcumbers, telling us, that the kindness
we had done him had obtain'd of S. Nicholas the good wind which was to carry us on in our
Voyage.
                  About 2. afternoon, we set off, made four leagues that daypunc; and came at night to a Village
called Cerodiza:Corodiza. but finding it more pleasant to be by the water side, than in a Village, we
caus'd our meat to dress'd there, and supp'd, while the Marriners, who made accompt to goe
thence that night, took some hours rest.
                  We slept not, but made sport with a young Bear, the Pristaf had brought us, which could
shew a thousand tricks. After midnight we set forward, and got four leagues to the Village
Soliza;Soliza. where the Pristaf, who had stay'd at Corodiza, overtook us, bringing along with
him his Host, who was a Knez, or Muscovite Prince, named Roman Iovanouits. He had
treated him so well, that both were got drunk: however, seeing they were still desirous to
drink, we supply'd them so well with Aquavitae and Sack, whereof we had good store, that
we laid them asleep.
                  We got that day six leagues to a Village called Grunza, which the Country people had also
absolutely forsaken,Grunza. which oblig'd us to take up our Lodging in the Fields, in a Meadow near
a great Pool, where we made three great fires: and in regard we had slept almost all day in the
Boat, we spent some part of the night i telling of stories, and diverting our selves with the
Bear. The Musketiers, who had been somewhat busy with the Aquavitae, entertain'd us with
some feats of their activity. Here we saw abundance of Cranes, and counted, upon the Pool,
above 300 of them.
                  The next day, Iul. 26. about three in the morning we prosecuted our Voyage, and before
noon got four leagues,Wisoko. to the Village of Wisoko. The Pristaf, whom we had invited to dinner,
hearing the name of Iesus pronounc'd, made the sign of the Cross several times upon his breast,
and desir'd to have our Prayer in writing, and liked it so well, that he said, he could not have
believ'd, that the Germans were so good Christians, and so just men.
                  The 27. all day, and the night following, we prosecuted our Voyage, so that the 28. with
the day, we were come to the Village of Krifseuiza. There we staid that day, to give the
Pristaf time to acquaint the Governour of Novogorod with our arrival,Krifseuiza. and to know his pleasure
concerning our reception.
                  This Village is within 2 leagues of Novogorod, and about 600 paces from it is a very fair Monastery,
which some call Nachatim,, but it is commonly called Krifseuiza Chutina Spasof
Monastir. It is well built, and better situated, having an Abbot, 60 Monks, and 400 Country
people to husband the grounds belonging to it: but it is oblig'd out of its Revenue
to maintain a hundred men of the Garrison of Novogorod, for the service of the Great
Duke.
                  The 29. we continu'd our Voyage,The Ambassadors came to Novogorod. and came to Novogorod, within a league of which we
met with some of our retinue, whom we had sent away from Riga, and who had expected us
for several moneths with much impatience. They met us in a Boat, and express'd much joy at
our arrival. The Weywode sent to our Inn, one Tun of Beer, another of Hydromel, and a
Barrel of Aquavitae; and we sent him a silver Cup, Vermilion gilt. We left Novogorod the
the 13. of Iuly,Brunits. and went 4 leagues farther by water, to Brunits, whence we finish'd our
Journey by Land.
                  As we were dis-embarking our Baggage at Brunits, August 1.AUGUS. came to the River side a Muscovian
Procession,A Muscovian Procession. to bless the water thereof. In the first place march'd two men, one carrying
a Cross, having at the four corners the four Evangelists; the other, an old Image, painted,
and cover'd with a clean linnen cloath. After them came a Priest pontifically vested, holding in
his hands a wooden Cross, a good half foot wide, and singing in consort with a little Boy who

carried a Book after him. Then came the Country people with their Wives and Children,
those who were of age carrying a wax Candle. After all came one who seem'd to be the Clark
of the Parish, having ten Tapers fastned together, all lighted. The Priest being come to the
River side, spent half an hour or better in singing and reading: Then he took the wax Candles
from the Clark, and extinguish'd them in the Water, in imitation of whom, the people
did the like with theirs. Then the Priest dipp'd his Cross three several times in the Water,
when he took it out letting it drop into a Basin destin'd for the preservation of that Water,
which they esteem'd most sacred. This Ceremony over, the Women put their Children, great
and small, into the Water, some with their shirts on, others naked. Those who needed not
the assistance of others leap'd in themselves. Nay some brought their Horses to drink, that they
might also participate of the vertue of that Holy Water. This done, the whole Procession return'd
to the Church, where the Priest, having given the people his benediction, dismiss'd
them.
                  About 4. afternoon, we got on Horse-back, after we had dispos'd our Baggage into 50.
Wagon,Crasmistansky. and travell'd that day five leagues, to a Village nam'd Crasmistansky. The next,
August 2.Gam Chresta. we travell'd eight leagues, and came at night to Gam Chresta. Gam, among the
Muscovites, are those places where Travellers take fresh Horses.
                  The 3. we came to Iazelbitza,Jaselbitza. a little Village which the Country people had forsaken. There
we met with this misfortune, that our Cook being gone two leagues further to provide our Supper,
we could not come up to him, by reason of the badness of the way, so that we had a sleepless
night of it. We met that day with several Officers, who, upon the Peace concluded between
the Polanders and Muscovites at Smolensko, had desired leave to go to their own Habitations.
                  The 4. we met at Simnogora,Simnogora Wolsolk. where are fresh Horses to be taken up, with Colonel Fuchs;
and the 6. at Wolsolk, with Colonel Charles. They both honour'd our Ambassadors with their
visits, which occasioning entertainments, begat also those??? excesses and disorders which ordinarily
attend them in Germany; in one whereof our Trumpetter mortally wounded one of our Muskettiers,
without any injury done him by the other. We left the wounded person behind, and
gave money to those who were to look to him. The Trumpetter was kill'd afterwards, after he
had been entertain'd into the Great Dukes service, at our return from Persia.
                  The 5. we pass'd through a Village, which the Inhabitants had forsaken, to avoid quartering
the German Souldiers, who had been disbanded neer Moscou. We lodg'd at night in the Village
Columna.Columna??? In those parts, we found many great blue stones, which the Tyrant Iohn Basilouits,
had caus'd to be taken out of the Sepulchres, when he took the City of Reuel, having
design'd them to be brought to Mosco; but news being come that he was dead??? they were unloaden
in the high-way, where they have remain'd ever since.
                  The 7.Budeua. we came Budeua, a Village also; but at our entrance into it, our Horses began to
wince, stand upon their hinder feet, and beat the ground, as if they had been bewitch'd, whereof
we could not imagine what should be the cause, till that having alighted, we found them cover'd
all over with Bees, which were beginning to fall-upon us, and prosecuted their animosity
so far, as to force us to keep them off with our Cloaks, and other Garments, and to go and
take up our quarters in the Fields. We understood since, that it was a Stratageme of the Inhabitants,
who had incens'd the Bees, purposely to prevent our lodging in the Village.
                  The 8. we came to a Stage where were fresh Horses,Torsock. and so to Torsock, a little Town situate
upon the descent of a Hill, not far from the High-way, fortified with Ramparts, and Bastions
of wood. Bread, Beer, and Hydromel were there excellent good. The Ambassadors caused
Huts to be made of boughs of Trees without the Town, where we Supp'd and Lodg'd that
night.
                  The 9. we passed over two Torrents, one neer Torsock, the other half a League from Miedna.Tuere.
We came at night to the Citie of Tuere, which is also on a Hill-side, as Torsock, but
somewhat bigger. These two places have each of them their Weywode, or Governour. The latter
hath its name from the River Tuere,The River Wolga. which passes by it, as well as the Wolga, which continuing
its course from this City, through Muscovy and Tartary, disembogues its self above 600
German Leagues thence (which make above 1500 French) in the Caspian Sea. It is already
so broad in those quarters, that we were forc'd to make use of a Ferry-boat to cross it. We
were lodg'd the other side of the City, in the Suburbs. This was our last stage for fresh Horses,
till we came to Moscou.
                  August 13.Nichola Nachinski. we came to a Village called Nichola Nachinski, two Leagues from Moscou,
whence our Pristaf dispatch'd an Express to give notice of our arrival.
                  The 14. the Pristaf, attended by his Interpreter and Secretary, came to Complement the
Ambassadors, giving them thanks for the kind treatment he had receiv'd from them, and making
an Apology for the ill they might have receiv'd from him. We presented him with a Vermilion
Gilt-Cup, and gave some ten or twelve Crowns among the rest. The same day, the Messenger
sent by the Pristaf return'd from Moscou, and oblig'd us to prepare for our Entrance,
which we made the same day in the order following.
                  
                     
                     1. The Strelits, or Muscovian Musketiers, who had convoy'd us, match'd in first.
                     2. After them, Iacob Scheve, our Harbinger, Michael Cordes, Captain of the ship, and Iohn
Algueyer, Clark of the Kitchin, all three abreast.
                     3. Three led Horses, to be presented to the Great Duke; one, black, and two, dappledgrey.
                     4. A Trumpetter.
                     5. Marshall, or Steward.
                     6. Three of our Gentlemen a-breast.
                     7. Three more of our Gentlemen.
                     8. The Secretary, Physician, and Controller.
                     9. The Ambassadors, attended each, by a Guard of four, with their Carabines, having on
their right hand, but a little distance, the Pristaf who had conducted them.
                     10. The six Pages, in two ranks.
                     11. A Coach with four grey Horses.
                     12. The Master of the Waggons, with eight others, three in a rank.
                     13. The Presidents design'd for the Great Duke, carry'd in five Litters, covered with Turkie
Tapistry.
                     14. An open Waggon, wherein Simon Frisins lay sick.
                     15. Forty six Waggons loaded with baggage.
                     16. Three Servants.
                  
                  Having march'd in this order, very slowly, till we came within half a League of the City,
we met ten Coureiers (or Messengers) who came one after another with full speed towards
us, to acquaint the Pristaf with the place, where they were whose Office it was to receive us;
with order, one while, to march on very slowly, another, to make more haste, to the end we
should be much about the same time with them at the place appointed for our reception. We
saw also several Muscovites; very well mounted and richly clad, who only rid at some distance
from us, and return'd having taken a view of us. Within a quarter of a League of the City,
we pass'd through a Body of above 4000 Muscovites, all excellently well mounted and sumptuously
clad. Most of the Suedish Ambassadors retinue came also to meet us, but were not permitted
to come neer us, so that we could only salute them at a distance.
                  Within a Pistol shot thence we saw coming towards us, two Pristafs clad in coats of Purfled
Satin mounted on two gallant white Horses. Instead of Bridles, they had Chains of silver, whereof
the links were two inches broad, but no thicker than the back of a knife, and of such a compass
as that a man might thrust in his first into them, which made a strange noise as the Horses went
along. The Great Duke's Master of the Horse followed them, with twenty led Horses all
white, and was accompany'd by a great number of persons both a foot and a hors-back. When
the Ambassadors and Pristafs were alighted,The reception of the Ambassadors. the antienter of the two uncover'd himself, and
said; The Grand Seigneur, Czaar, and Great Duke, Michael Federouits, conservator of all the
Russians, Prince of Vladimer, Mosco, Novogorod, Czaar of Cassan, Czarr of Astrachan, Czaar
of Siberia, Lord of Plescou, Great Duke of Tuersky, Iugersky, Premsky, Wadsky, Bolgarsky, &c. Lord
and Great Duke of Novogorod in the Low Countries, Commander of Rosansky, Rostofsky, Gerastafky,
Besolerski, Vdorski, Obdorski, Condinski, and of all the North, Lord of the Countries of Iveria,
Czaar of Kartalmski and Ingusinski, Prince of the Countries of Kabardinski, Cyrcaski, and Iorkski,
Lord and Soveraign of many other Seignenries, receives you, as great Ambassadors from the
Duke of Sleswick, Holstein, Stormarie and Ditmars, Count of Oldenbourg and Delmenhorst. He
grants you and the Gentlemen of your retinue the favour to make your entrance upon his own
Horses, and hath appointed us Pristafs to have a care of you, and so to furnish you with all things
necessary, during your aboad at Mosco. To which Complement when the Ambassador Crusius
had made answer, there were brought two very stately white Horses, with Saddles after the German
fashion, Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, with Footh-cloaths, and Harness suitable.
                  As soon as the Ambassadors were mounted, the Pristaf and Musketiers, who had conducted
us from the Frontiers, were drawn off. There were brought also ten other white Horses for
the chiefest of our retinue, with Saddles after the Muscovian fashion, of Cloath of Gold and
Purfled Satin.The Pristafs take the vpper hand of the Amdors. The Pristafs took the Ambassadors between them, though in Muscovy, he is
thought to have the more honourable place, who hath the right hand free. After them march'd
the Muscovian Grooms of the stable, who had the coverings of their Saddles of Leopard-skins,
Cloath of Gold, and Scarlet. The Cavalry we had seen in the fields, and the other Muscovites,
came powring into the City with the Ambassadors, and accompany'd them to their
Lodgings,Their Lodgings. within the white wall, in that quarter which is called Czarskigorod, that is to say,
the City of the Czaar. We had assign'd us two Citizens houses built of wood, the Pristaf making
this excuse, in the name of the Great Duke, that a fire having not only consum'd the ordinary
house for the entertainment of Ambassadors, but also another great house appointed for
our Lodgings, we could not possibly be better accommodated for the present; And indeed, at

our entrance into the City, we had observed whole streets burnt down, the fire having been so
violent, that it had reduc'd to ashes above five thousand houses: insomuch that most of the Inhabitants
were forc'd to lodge in Tents and Huts.
                  Ere we had taken a view of our Lodging,The Great Dukes refreshing present to the Ambassadors. the presents from the Great Duke's Kitchin and
Cellar were brought us; viz. eight Sheep, thirty Capons and Pullets, great store of white and
brown bread, and 22 sorts of drinks, Wine, Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae, all brought in
by 32 Muscovites, who marching all in a file made the shew so much the greater. This done???
the doors of our Lodging were lock'd upon us,They are under a Guard. and a Guard of twelve Musketiers set, to prevent
all communication between us and the Inhabitants, till after the first Audience. The Pristafs
in the mean time fail'd not to visit us every day, to assure us of their readiness to serve us.
They had also left with us an Interpreter, to facilitate the service which the Musketiers were
oblig'd to do us in the buying of our Provisions and other things. This Interpreter was a Muscovite
born, and had been taken prisoner by the Polanders; by which means he fell into the
hands of Prince Ianus Radzivil, who brought him to Leipsig, where he learnt the German
Tongue.
                  Aug. 15. The Muscovites celebrated the Feast of our B. Lady's ascension, and the same day
ended a Fast they had begun the first of that moneth. The 17. was design'd for our first Audience;
but the Great Duke being gone out of the City to do his Devotions, we spent the day in
giving God our humble thanks for his happy conduct of us to the place for which our Embassy
was design'd. We caus'd Te Deum to be sung, with Musick, and our Minister to make a Sermon,
at which, as also at the Dinner which follow'd it, was present, by permission on of the
Great Duke, M. Balthazar Moucheron, who manag'd the Affairs of the Duke of Holstein at
Mosco, in the quality of Commissary. He told us, that the Muscovites thought our entrance
very handsome, and wondred much that Germany should have Princes able to send so
considerable an Embassy. They give all strange Princes the quality of Knez, though their Knez
are properly no more than what Gentlemen are with us, and, those excepted who have publick
employments relating to the State, the rest have no great Estates, it may be, about 800.
or 1000 per annum.
                  The 18. The two Pristafs came to acquaint us that the Great Duke would give us publick
Audience the next day. They desir'd also, in the Chancellors name, a Catalogue of the presents
we were to make his Majesty. After Dinner, the younger Pristaf came to confirm the
notice they had given us in the morning, viz. that on the morrow we should have the honour
to kiss the Great Dukes hand. We ask'd him what the discharging of the great Guns the day
before meant, and the shooting we had seen out of our Windows in a great Meadow. He told
us, it was only to make tryal of some pieces which the Great Duke had lately order'd to be
cast. Others said, that they had been discharg'd, only to make it appear that the Muscovites
had not lost all their Artillery before Smolensco, as some would have had it believ'd.
                  Aug. 19. The Pristafs came to see whether we were ready for Audience; and having perceiv'd
that our men had put on their best Cloaths, and that all was in readiness, they went immediately
to give notice thereof at the Castle, whence were brought us the white Horses which
we had at our Entrance. About 9 of the Clock the Pristafs return'd to us, having their striptsatin
Coats carried after them, as also their Caps of Martins skins, which they left in the Ambassadors
Antichamber.The Ambassadors Cavalcade We mounted with our Cloaks on, but no Swords, none being permitted
to wear any in the Great Dukes presence, and rode towards the Castle, the Cavalcade
being as followeth.
                  In the front, march'd 36 Musketiers.
                  After them our Steward.
                  Three Gentlemen of the Ambassadors retinue.
                  Three other Gentlemen.
                  The Commissary, Secretary, and Physician.
                  After them went the Presents,The Presents. led and carried by Muscovites, viz. One Horse coal-black,
with a rich covering.
                  One, dapple grey.
                  Another, dapple-grey.
                  Harness for one Horse, set out with Silver, and enrich'd with Turkish Stones, Rubies, and
other precious Stones, carried by two Muscovites.
                  One Cross of Chrysolite enchac'd in Gold, about half a foot long, carried in a Basin.
                  An Ebony Cabinet, garnish'd with Gold, like a little Apothecaries Shop, with its Boxes
and Vials of Gold, enrich'd with precious Stones, full of several excellent Chymical extractions,
carried by two Muscovites.
                  A small Vessel of Rock-Christal, garnish'd with Gold, and beset with Rubies.
                  A great Looking-Glass, being an ell and a quarter high, and half an ell broad, in an Ebony
frame, with Boughs and Fruits carv'd thereon in Silver, carried by two Muscovites.
                  
                     
A Clock, on which was represented, in painting, the Parable of the Prodigal Child.
                  A Walking-Staff, Vermilion Gilt, in which was a piece of Perspective.
                  A great Ebony Clock, in an Ebony Case, garnish'd with Silver.
                  Next went two Gentlemen of the Chamber, carrying up on high in the Air, the Credential
Letters from his Highness, one to the Great Duke, the other to the Patriarch his Majesties Father.
His name was Philaretes Nikidits; He dy'd after our departure from Holstein,
but we were told it would not be amiss to make it known we had Letters of credence
for him.
                  Then follow'd the Ambassadors between the two Pristafs, having before them the Interpreters,
on each side four Lacqueys, and behind them, the Pages.
                  It was, from our Lodging to the Castle a good quarter of a German league, there being above
2000 Strelits or Musketiers dispos'd on both sides of the street, to make us free passage
to the place of Audience. The streets, windows and houses tops were full of people, who were
come from all quarters of the City to see our Cavalcade. We march'd in very good order,
halting and advancing according to the orders, which the Courriers, who rid with full speed
from the Castle, brought our Pristafs; to the end we might come to the Hall of Audience,
just as the Great Duke were sate in his Throne.
                  Being come into the Castle-Court, we pass'd before the Posolsky Precase, or the Chancery
for strangers affairs, where we alighted. After the Officers, and Gentlemen, had taken their
places, to wit, the Steward, in the head of the Presents, and the Gentlemen, with the other
Officers, immediately before the Ambassadors, we were brought to Audience. The Hall
for Audience is on the right hand of the Cour: when there come any Ambassadors from Persia,
Turky, or Tartary, they are carried up a stone pair of stairs on the right hand; but in regard
we were Christians, we took the left hand, and were led through a vaulted Gallery, purposely
that we might pass by a very fair Church, where they were then at service. Before we came
into the Hall, we saw, in a spacious vaulted appartment, abundance of people, and among
others many antient Men, venerable for their long snowy beards, whereof some sate, others
stood along the walls, all clad in long Coats of stript Satin, and Caps of Martins skins: they
told us they were his Majesties Goses, that is, his principal Merchants or Factors, who had
those habits out of the Great Dukes Wardrobe, that they might honour him in those kinds of
Ceremonies, conditionally they return'd them assoon as they were over.
                  The Ambassadors being come to the door of the Antichamber, they met with two Bojares,
or Lords, clad in Coats of Purfled Satin, cover'd with an embroidery of great Pearls, who
were to receive them at their Entrance. They told them that his Czaarick Majesty did them, and
the Gentlemen of their retinue, the favour of admitting them into his Presence. The Presents
were stay'd in the Antichamber, and they conducted into the Hall the Ambassadors with the
Officers, Gentlemen, and Pages, there going before them Iohn Hermes, the Great Dukes
principal Interpreter. As soon as he had set his foot within the Hall; he saluted his Majesty
with a loud voice, wishing him all prosperity and long life, and acquainted him with the arrival
of the Ambassadors. The Hall was square, and vaulted, hang'd and floor'd with Tapestry.
The roof was gilt, and had several Sacred Stories painted therein. The Great Duke's
Chair was opposite to the door, against the wall, rais'd from the floor three steps, having at
the four corners Pillars which were Vermilion Gilt, about three inches about, with each of
them, at the height of an ell and a half, an Imperial Eagle of Silver, near which the Canopy
or upper part of the Chair rested upon the same Pillars: besides which the said Chair had at the
four Corners as many little Turrets of the same stuff, having also, at the ends, Eagles, after
the same manner. We were told there was another Chair of State a-making, about which
were bestow'd 1600 Marks of Silver, and 120 ounces of Ducat-gold for the gilding, and that
it would amount to above 25000 Crowns. The designer of it was a German, born at Nuremberg,
his name, Esay Zinkgraf
                  The Great Duke sate in his Chair, clad in a long Coat, embroider'd with Pearls, and beset
with all sorts of precious Stones. He had above his Cap, which was of Martins-skins, a
Crown of Gold, beset with great Diamonds, and in his right hand a Scepter of the same Metall,
and no less rich, and so weighty, that he was forc'd to relieve one hand with the other.
On both sides of his Majesties Chair stood young Lords, very handsome, both as to Face and
Body, clad in long Coats, of white Damask, with Caps of a Linx's skin, and white Buskins,
with Chains of Gold, which crossing upon the breast, reach'd down to their hips. They had
laid over their shoulders each a Silver Ax, whereto they put their hands, as if they had been
going to give their stroke. On the right side of the Chair, upon a Pyramid of Silver carv'd
thorough, stood the Imperial Apple, of massy Gold, representing the World, as big as a
Canon-bullet of 48 pound weight; and at a like distance, on the same side, a Basin and Ewer
and a Napkin, to wash and wipe the Great Dukes hands, after the Ambassadors and those of
their retinue had kiss'd them. The principal Bojares or Lords of the Court, to the number of
fifty, were all set upon Benches by the wall-side, on one side, and opposite to the Great

Duke, very richly clad, with great Caps, of a black Fox furr, a good quarter of an ell high.
The Chancellor stood on the right hand, some five paces from the chair.
                  They having made a low reverence at their Entrance,The Ceremonies of the audience. were plac'd in the midst of the
Hall opposite to the Great Duke, and about ten paces from him, having behind them the Officers
and Gentlemen of their retinue, on the right, the two Gentlemen who carry'd the Credential
Letters, which they held before them, and on the left, the Interpreter Iohn Helmes.
This done, the Great Duke made a sign to the Chancellor, that he should tell the Ambassadors,
that his Majesty granted them the favour to do him reverence. The??? Ambassadors went one after
another, and kiss'd his right hand, which he very gracefully reachd to them, and with a smiling
countenance, taking the Scepter in the mean time in his left hand. Now it is to be observed,
that in these ceremonies, he who kisses the Great Dukes hand is not to touch it with his
own, and that only the Ambassadors of Christian Princes have the honour to kiss it, which
the Turks and Persians, much less the Tartarians, have not.
                  This Ceremony ended, he caus'd the Chancellor to tell them, that if they had ought to propose
from their Prince, they might do it. Whereupon the Ambassador Crusius made him a
complement from the Duke our Master, and his condoleances for the death of the Patriarch his
Father, adding, that his Highness hoping we should have found him living, had given them
Letters of Credence for him, and that they had brought them along with those his Highness
writ to his Majesty. Whereupon he took the Letters from those that held them, and was advancing
to deliver them; but the Great Duke made a sign to the Chancellor to take
them, and having commanded him to come to him, he whisper'd in his ear the answer
he would make the Ambassadors. The Chancellor being return'd to his place, said,
The Grand Seigneur Czaar, and Great Duke, &c. tells thee, Philip Crusius, and thee, Otton
Brugman, Ambassadors from the Duke of Holstein, that he hath received the Letters of his
Highness, that he will order them to be translated, and he will acquaint you with his intention
by his Bojares, and that he will make answer thereto. The Chancellor, who had not uncover'd
himself, no more than the other Lords, took off his Cap when he pronounc'd the name
of his Majesty, or that of his Highness of Holstein.
                  This done, The Ambassadors were seated on a Bench cover'd with a Turkie Carpet, which
was set behing them, and the Chancellor told them, that the Great Duke was pleas'd that
their Officers and Gentlemen should have the honour of kissing his hand. Which done, the
Great Duke rais'd himself up a little in his Chair, and said to the Ambassadors, Knez Frederic
jescha sdorof? Is Duke Frederick in good health? Whereto it was answer'd, that at our
departure we had left him very well, God grant a good life and a long, and all happiness to his
Majesty and Highness.
                  Then was brought in a List of the Presents, which were sent in with it??? and stood some time
before the Great Duke, till the Chancellor ordered them to be taken away. The said Chancellor
presently after told the Ambassadors, that the Czaar and Great Duke of all the Russians,
Lord and Soveraign of many Seignories, &c. was further pleas'd they should speak of their
Aairs; but they desir'd, that, to avoid doing any thing prejudicial to the Treatise made between
the Crown of Sueden and his Highness, concerning the Commerce of Persia, they might
have a private Audience together; which was accordingly granted. After this, the Great Duke
caus'd them to be asked, whether they were in health, and whether they wanted any thing, giving
them notice, that that day he would do them the favour to treat them with meat from his
own Table. This was the first publick Audience the Ambassadors had. They were brought
back to the Antichamber by the same Bojares who had receiv'd them at their enrance. We
mounted at the same place where we alighted, and return'd to our Lodgings, accompany'd by
our Pristafs,The Grand Duke treats the Ambassadors. in the same order as we had gone thence. We were hardly alighted ere there came
in one of the Gentlemen of the Great Duke's Chamber. He was of the quality of the Knez, to
which his countenance and behaviour was suitable, being of great stature, magnificently clad,
excellently well mounted and attended, and had been sent by the Great Duke, to treat the Ambassadors
at Dinner. Assoon as he was come in, he caus'd the cloath to be laid, on which were
in the first place set, a Salt-seller, and two Vinegar-dishes of Silver, and certain drinking-cups,
whereof three were of Gold, and two others of Silver, and so big, that they were above a foot
diameter, a great Knife and some Forks. This Lord, seating himself at the end of the Table,
ordered the Ambassadors to sit down by him, the Gentlemen standing before them. He caus'd
to be set on the Table before the Ambassadors three great vessels full of Sack, Rhenish-Wine,
and Hydromel, and caus'd the meat to be serv'd out, on 38. great Silver Dishes, which consisted
in boil'd, rosted and pastry. All being serv'd, the Knez rise, caus'd the Ambassadors to come
before the Table, and told them, there was the Provision which the Czaar had commanded him
to entertain them withall, praying them to be pleas'd with the treatment. Then he took the
great Cup, which he caus'd to be fill'd with excellent good Hydromel, made with Raspices
and having drunk his Majesties health, he caus'd as much to be given the Ambassadors, and all
their retinue, obliging us to drink the Great Duke's health all at the same time. Some of us

would have reach'd their arms over the Table, to take the Gobelet, but the Muscovite would
not suffer it, saying, that Table then represented the Great Duke's, who permits none to go behind
his Table, and so oblig'd them to come round about and take the Cup. This health was
follow'd by that of our Prince, which he began to the Ambassadors, saying, God grant health
and prosperity to his Highness, and make him long to continue in a good correspondence and amity
with his Majesty. The third health was that of the Prince, the Great Duke's son. This done,
they sate to the Table, and some Gobelets of a Wine made of Cherries and Mulberries were
drunk about. The Ambassadors presented him with a Vermilion-gilt cup, of the weight of
three Marks and a half, which he caus'd to be carried before him, as he return'd to the Castle.
                  Aug. 20. The Pristafs came to tell us, that the Great Duke was pleas'd we should go
 and gave us the liberty to walk about the City, and to that end Horses should be
brought us from his own stables, when ere we should desire it. We were also permitted to visit
the Suedish Ambassadors, and to receive their Visits. All which were thought so great favours,
that the Muscovites themselves were astonish'd at it; for till then it had not been suffer'd,
that the Domesticks of strange Ambassadors should walk about the City, but, when their
occasions oblig'd them to go abroad, they were accompany'd by one or more of the Musketiers.
Two dayes after, the Pristaf accompany'd by a Groom of the Great Duke's stables, brought
us six horses, and conducted us to the Lodgings of the Suedish Ambassadors, whom we saw several
times after, and held a very fair correspondence with them.
                  Aug. 23. The Ambassadors would have invited to Dinner Dr. Wendelin, the Physician, the
Apothecary, and some other servants of the Great Duke; but the Chancellor would not suffer
them to come, and forbad them seeing us for three dayes; of which rigorous treatment we could
have no accompt, till afterwards, that we were told, it was, because, the Presents had not yet
been valu'd, among which was the Cabinet made like an Apothecaries shop, we spoke of before,
which could not be valu'd but by them.
                  The 24. Came before Moscou Arnald Spirin, Farmer General of the Customs in Livonia,
through which he had pass'd, and was sent by the Crown of Sueden to be present at the Negotiation,
which the Ambassadors thence were to manage for Commerce, wherein he was very
well vers'd. The Muscovites, who knew him, made some difficulty to entertain him in that
quality; but perceiving the Suedes took it ill, they were at last content to do it, and sent a Pristaf
to meet and receive him.
                  September 1.SEPTEM. The Muscovites celebrated the first day of their New year;The Muscovian New-years day. for having no other
Epoche than that of the Creation of the World, which they believe to have been in Autumn,
they begin the year with the Moneth of September, and they accompted then 7142 years, according
to the opinion of the Greeks, and the Eastern Church, which count 5508. from the
Creation of the World to the birth of Christ; whereto add 1634. you will find the number
7142. whereas we accompt from the Creation of the World to the same year 1634. but 5603
years. Their Procession was hand som enough, consisting of above 20000 persons, of all ages,
who were admitted into the outer Court of the Castle. The Patriarch, attended by almost
400 Priests, all Pontifically habited, and carrying a many Banners, Images, and old Books
open, came out of the Church, which is on the right hand of the second Court, while the
Great Duke came out on the left hand of the same Court, accompany'd by his Councellours of
State, Knez, and Bojares. The Great Duke and the Patriarch advanc'd one towards the other,
and kiss'd, the Duke having his Cap in his hand; and the Patriarch, who had a Mitre on his
head, held in his id a Golden Cross, about a foot long, beset with Diamonds and other
precious stones, which he presented to the Great Duke to kiss. That done, the Patriarch gave
his Majesty his Benediction, as also to all the people, wishing them all prosperity in the New
year. There were many Muscovitis who held their Petitions in the air, and, their way of
presenting them to the Great Duke, was, to cast them with no small noise at his feet, whence
certain Officers gather'd them up, to be carried to his Majesties chamber, that they might be
answer'd. This done, the Processions parted, and return'd to the place from whence
they came.
                  Sept. 3. Gillenstiern, Bureus, and Spiring, who were to Negotiate joyntly with us concerning
the Passage into Persia, were conducted to their publick audience, with the same Ceremonies
as we had been, while the two other Suedish Ambassadors, Mr. Philip Scheiding, and Col.
Henry Fleming were to treat in private, of the difference which were between the Crown of
Sueden and the Great Duke. The Three former desired in their audience to be receiv'd joyntly
with us, to treat with those whom it should please his Majesty to appoint for that purpose:
which was granted.
                  Hereupon, all the Ambassadors, as well the Suedish as ours, went the 5th to the Castle.
They were at first conducted into a spacious appartment, on the left hand, where they found
the same Goses, or Merchants, and in the same habits, as we had seen at our first Audience.
Thence they went into a Hall, where the four Commissioners appointed to treat with us, were
sate at a Table expecting us. They were, two Bojares, and two Chancellors, or Secretaries

of State, very richly clad, having Coats of stript Satin, embroidered with very great Perls and
other precious stones, and great Golden Chains which made a Cross upon their breasts. The
Bojares had Caps, after the fashion of calotts, beset with Perls, having in the midst a clustre of
Diamonds and precious Stones. The other two had their Caps of black-fox fur, according to
the ordinary fashion. They receiv'd the Ambassadors very civilly, and intreated them to sit
down by them; but with all their civility they took up the best places themselves, at one corner
of the Hall, where the benches joyn'd. The Ambassadors took up theirs neer them against
the Wall; and there was brought a seat without any back, for the Chancellors or Secretaries of
State, opposite to the others. Iohn Helmes, the Great Duke's chief Interpreter, stood among
our Pristafs, and all the Gentlemen, with all the rest of our retinue, stay'd in the Antichamber,
except only the two Secretaries of the Suedish Ambassy and ours, as many Interpreters, and a
Muscovite Clark, who was taken in to take notes of what was treated of. All having taken
their places, one of the Bojares ask'd the Ambassadors, whether they were supply'd with necessary
provisions, or wanted any thing? The Ambassadors made answer, that they had occasion
rather to commend those who had the management thereof, and that they gave his Majesty
their most humble thanks for his care of them. After this complement, all rise up, and being
uncover'd, the more considerable of the two Bojares, said, The Grand Seigneur Czaar and
Great Duke (reciting all his Titles, and being all sat down again, he went on) gives you to
understand, you Lords Ambassadors from the Crown of Sueden, and Duke of Holstein, that he
hath caus'd your Letters to be translated into the Muscovian Language, and that he hath also
hearkned to the Propositions you made to him, at the publick audience he gave you. Upon that
they all rose again, and the other Bojare, uncovering himself, said, The Grand Seigneur, Czaar
and Great Duke, &c. (not omitting any of the former titles, and so sitting down, continued)
wishes the Queen of Sueden and the Duke of Holstein all prosperity, and victory over their
Enemies, and tells you, that he hath read their Letters, and that he well understands their intention.
The third Commissioner proceeded with the same Ceremonies, saying The Grand
Seigneur, &c. hath seen the Letters you have brought him, is satisfy'd, that all credence is to
be given you in what you shall say and propose, which shall accordingly be done. To which
the fourth added, That his Majesty, the Czaar, had appointed them Commissioners, to receive
from them, what they had to propose and desire; and thereupon read the names of the Commissioners,
who were:
                  
                     Knez Boris Michaelouits, Likow Obolenscoi, Weywode of Tuere
                     Knez Vasili Iuanouits Stresnow, Weywode of Tarschock
                     The two Secretaries of State, whom they call Dumnoi Diaken, were,
                     Iuan Tarascouits Granmatin, Lord Keeper of the Seals or Chancellor, &c.
                     Iuan Offonassiowsin Gauaarenow, Vicechancellor.
                  
                  This done, they all rise, and one of the Suedish Ambassadors, Eric Gillenstierna, having given
his Majesty thanks on the behalf of his Mistriss, for their admission to a private audience, read to
the Commissioners their proposition, contained in one sheet of paper, written in the the German
tongue. We would have done the like with ours; but being larger than the other, to forbear
importuning the Commissioners, we thought it enough to put it in with that of the Suedish Ambassadors.
The Commissioners, having receiv'd them, went up to the Great Duke's Chamber,
to communicate them to him, leaving us alone, save that the Pristafs and Gentlemen of our retinue
were permitted to come into the room to entertain us. Having expected a good half-hour,
the Vice-chancellor came down to tell us, that we should have no other answer at that time, than
that his Majesty would cause the propositions to be translated, and would let us know his resolution
with the soonest.
                  Sept. 10. The Suedish Ambassadors had their last private audience, as to what concern'd the
affairs of that Crown.
                  The 12.A Tartarian Cavalcade. We saw a Cavalcade of three Tartarian Ambassadors. sent by the Prince of Cassan,
a Vassal of the Great Duke's. They had no other retinue or company than that of sixteen servants,
who follow'd them, with their Bows and Arrows in their hands. Their Cassocks, were
of a very coarse red cloath; but at their return from audience, they were in Damask coats, some
red, some yellow, which the Great Duke had bestow'd on them by way of present. There
hardly passes a year, but these Gentlemen, as well as the other Tartars their Neighbours, send
such an Ambassy to Moscou; not so much for any business they have, as to get some Furs,
Martins skins, and silk Vestments.
                  The 15. Our Pristafs came to tell us, that the Great Dutchess was, the day before, deliver'd
of a Daughter, who was already Christned, and nam'd Sophia, according to the custom of the
Muscovites, who baptize their Children immediately after their birth, and without any Ceremonies
or entertainments, as they do in other Countreys. The Patriarch was her Godfather,
as he had been to all the rest of the Great Duke's Children, who would nevertheless

have us to participate of that joy, upon which accompt, our ordinary allowance was
doubled.
                  The 17. Came in a Turkish Ambassador,The entrance of a urkish Ambassador. who was receiv'd with great Ceremonies; and
though they sent 16000 Horse to meet him, yet in all that Army there were seen but six Colours.
The first, which was that of the Duke's Guard, was of white Satin, and had in the
midst, within a circle of Laurel, an Imperial Eagle with a triple Crown, with this Motto,
Virtute Supero. One of Crimson Damask branch'd, having in the midst a Ianus with two
faces. One of a plain red Damask; and the other three, blew and white, whereof one had a
Gryffon, another, a Snail; the third, a naked Arm coming out of the Clouds, and holding a
sword. 'Tis thought these were the devises of the German officers, during the War at Smolensco.
Every Colours was attended by Timbrels and Hautbois, but the white had six Trumpets,
which made a wretched inharmonious noise. The Knez and Lords that were sent to meet
this Ambassadors, were excellently well mounted, upon Horses that came out of Persia, Poland,
and Germany, very richly set out, having with them out of the Great Dukes Stable, twenty
led Horses, with great silver Chains instead of Bridles, such as we have mention'd
before.
                  We, with the Gentlemen and Officers of the Suedish Officers retinue, made up a Troop of
fifty Horse, under the command of Wolfwolf Spar, Gentleman of the Horse to the Suedish Embassy,
who, as our Captain, march'd in the head of the Troop. We went a good league to
meet the Ambassador, who no sooner perceiv'd us, but he look'd very earnestly upon us, and
we upon him. We kept along with him a good while, to take the better notice of his retinue,
and Cavalcade, which march'd in the order following.
                  First, march'd 46 Strelits, having, instead of Muskets, Bows and Arrows, and Cimitars
by their sides. After them came a Pristaf clad in a Coat of Brocado, and follow'd by eleven
Men, clad in Red Branched Velvet, whereof some were Grecian and Turkish Merchants, some
Greek Ecclesiasticks. After them march'd the Ambassador's Steward, alone, and behind him
a Guad of four, with Bows and Arrows. After them two Cavalliers very richly clad, immediately
preceding the Ambassador, who march'd alone. He was a middle-statur'd Man,
much tann'd in the face, his Beard very black: His under-coat was of a White-Flowr'd Satin,
and his upper Garment of Satin purfled with Gold, lined with Martins-skins. His Turbant
was white, as were also those of his retinue. He was in a sorry Wagon, of a white kind of
Wood, but all cover'd with rich Tapestry. The rest of his Train consisted in above forty Waggons
of Baggage, which were every one kept by one or two Boys. Being come within a quarter
of a league of the City, near, as he imagin'd, the place where the Muscovites would receive
him, he mounted an excellent Arabian Horse. Nor indeed had he rode a Pistol-shot, ere
he met the two Pristafs appointed for his reception, with the Great Duke's Horses, according
to the custom. The Pristafs continued on Horsback, till the Ambassador had alighted; but
he, on the other side, stirr'd not his Turbant, though the Muscovites took off their Caps,
when they pronounc'd the Great Duks name.
                  After this first Complement, the Pristafs immediately mounted; the Ambassadour did what
he could to be in the Saddle as soon as they, or sooner; but they had brought him a very high
Horse (with a Saddle yet much higher, according to the Muscovian fashion) and so skittish
withal, that he not only found some difficulty to get up, but very narrowly scap'd being hurt
by him. Being got up, the Pristafs took him between them, and conducted him to the ordinary
place for the entertainment of Ambassadors, which had been built up since our coming
thither. As soon as he was got in, the doors were shut, and several Guards of Musketiers
plac'd about it.
                  Our Ambassadors intended to have gone that day to those of Sueden, who had invited them
to dinner, to shew them the Turks, who were lodg'd near them, the Suedes having a prospect
into their Court: but the Chancellor sent to desire us not to stir abroad that day, for reasons
he could not discover.
                  The 19. We had the second private Audience with the suedish Ambassadors.
                  The 23. The Turkish Ambassadour had his first publick Audience,The Turkish Ambassadors first audience. to which he went
in this order.
                  In the Front march'd 20 Cosaques, mounted on white Horses, out of the Great Duke's stables:
after them, the Turkish and Greek Merchants; and then the Presents, viz.
                  Twenty pieces of Satin stript with Gold, carried by so many Muscovites, who march'd all
in a file.
                  A Golden Cross, about a fingers length, beset with several large Diamonds, carried by a
Muscovite in a Basin.
                  A Vessel of Rock-Chrystal, adorn'd with Gold, and enrich'd with precious Stones.
                  A Belt or Girdle for a Cimitar, enrichd with Gold, and beset with precious Stones.
                  A Pearl of great bigness, laid on a piece of water'd Taffata, in a Basin.
                  Harness for two Horses, embroider'd with Gold, and set with Pearls.
                  
                     
A very fair Diamond-ring, in a Basin.
                  A Ruby, as big as a Crown piece of Silver, enchac'd in Gold, in a Basin.
                  A very fair Battel-Ax, which they call Bulaf, form'd like a Scepter.
                  After the Presents march'd eight Turks, two a-breast, and after them, two very handsome
young men, carrying upon great pieces of silk, the Credential Letters, which though folded,
were yet at least half an ell wide. The Greek Ecclesiasticks were not in the Cavalcade, but had
their Audience by themselves the 28. following. Two Muscovy Priests went to them at their
Lodgings, and conducted them to the Castle, where they met a great number of Priests, who
accompany'd them to their audience. Their presents were;
                  Six Basins with Relicks, or a parcel of Bones, whereof some were gilt.
                  Linings for a Priest's Cope, embroider'd with Gold and Perls.
                  A Head-stall for a Horse, beset with precious Stones.
                  Two pieces of Satin purfled with Gold.
                  One Priest's Cope.
                  One piece of silver'd Taby, with flowers of Gold.
                  The Greeks march'd after the Presents, clad in Violet Chamlet, and had a Cross carried before
them.
                  Our Ambassadors had also Letters from the Elector of Saxony to the Great Duke, and
thought fit to deliver them at a Publick Audience, for which was appointed St. Michael's day,
Sept. 29. We went in the same order as the time before, and the Letters were carried M.
Vchterits upon black and yellow Taffata, which are the Elector's Colours. The Great Duke
receiv'd them with much kindness, enquir'd after the health of his Electoral Highness, and commanded
we should once more be furnish'd with meat from his own Table; which indeed was
brought us, not ready dress'd as the former, but we were left to order it as we would our
selves.
                  October 1. the Muscovites keep as one of their most solemn Festivals,OCTOB. A Muscovian Festival. or Prasnick: the Ceremonies,
these. The Great Duke attended by the whole Court, and the Patriarch, accompany'd
by all the Clergy, went in Procession to the Church which is in the outer Court of the Castle,
called by the Muscovites, that of the Blessed Trinity, by the Germans, Ierusalem. But
before they went into it, they turn'd aside to a place balcony'd about much after the form of a
Theatre, on the right hand as you go to the Church, neer which place are two great pieces of
Canon, whereof the bore is at least half an ell diameter. The Great Duke and the Patriarch,
being got into it, not admitting any other, the Patriarch presented to his Majesty an Image
painted upon a piece of past-board, which folded as it had been a book, enrich'd with silver in
the middle, and at the four corners, to which Image the Czaar made a most low reverence, and
touch'd it with his fore-head, the Priests in the mean time muttering over their Prayers. Which
done, the Patriarch approaching the Great Duke again, presented him, to kiss it, a Golden
Cross, of about a foot length, beset with Diamonds. He also touch'd his forehead and temples
with it: whereupon they all went into the Church, where they concluded the service.
                  The Greeks that came along with the Turkish Ambassador, went in also, by a priviledge particular
to them, of all Christians, whom the Muscovites suffer not to enter their Churches; but
they permit the Greeks, as such as profess the same Religion with them.
                  Octob. 8. we had our third private Audience, with the Suedish Ambassadors, and were above
two hours in conference with the Great Duke's Ministers.
                  The 12. the Great Duke went on Pilgrimage,The Great Duke goes a Pilgrimage. to a Church half a league from the City. He
rode alone on horseback, with a whip in his hand, and was follow'd by above 1000. horse.
The Knez and Bojares who attended him, march'd ten a-breast, which made a noble show, and
express'd the greatness of the Prince. The Great Dutchess, with the young Prince and Princess,
followed them in a large Chariot, all of Joyners work, cover'd with Scarlet, the curtains
of yellow Taffata, drawn by sixteen white horses. After the Dutchess's, the Court-Ladies
were carried in 22. other Chariots, of wood, painted green, covered with Scarlet, the curtains
drawn close, so that those within could not be seen. I had the happiness, the wind having
blown those of the Great Dutchess, a little on one side, to have a glimps of her, and I thought
her very handsome, and very richly clad. On both sides march'd above a hundred Strelits, having
white tlaves in their hands, to keep off the people, who were thronging to bless their Princess,
for whom the Muscovites have a particular respect and devotion.
                  The 23. we had, with the Suedish Ambassadors, our fourth private Audience, wherein we
concluded our Negotiation, The 28. the Suedish had their last publick Audience in order to
their departure, returning from which, they caus'd the Answer to their Letters, to be carried
by two Gentlemen. The 7. and 10. of November they departed from Mosco, in three troops,
some taking the way of Livonia, others that of Sueden.
                  Nov. 19. we had our fifth and last private Audience,NOVEM. at which it was told us, that
his Czaarick Majesty, having taken our propositions into serious consideration, had at last resolv'd
to gratifie his Highness the Duke of Holstein, as his Friend, Uncle, and Ally, as to

what he had desir'd of him, and to grant him, what he had deny'd many other Princes and Potentates
of Europe, to wit, a passage through Muscovy to go into Persia, and that his Ambassadors
might go thither,The Great Duke grants the Ambassadors a passage through his Country. but with this proviso, that they should first return back to Holstein, and
bring him the ratification of the present Treaty.
                  Having so happily, though with much difficulty, perfected our negotiation, we thought it
not amiss, to divert our selves, for some days, among our friends; as we did at the Christening
of a Child of the Residents of Sueden, at a feast which Dr. Wendelin made, at the marriage
of a Kinsman of his, and at the magnificent entertainment which David Ruts, one of the
chiefest Dutch Merchants there, gave us at his own house.
                  The 22. The Muscovites made a solemn Procession to a Church, near the ordinary place
where the Ambassadors are entertain'd, at which the Great Duke and the Patriarch were present.
There was a passage made with Deal-boards, from the Castle to the Church, along
which came first several pedling Merchants, who sold wax Candles; after them, some that
swept the passage and kept it clean. The Procession was thus.
                  First, went a man carrying an Ewer, and a Napkin.
                  Three men carrying Banners, like Cornet's Colours, half Red, half White.
                  Sixty one Priests, in their Copes.
                  Four Cherubins carried upon long poles.
                  A man carrying a Lantern at the top of a long pole.
                  Forty Priests.
                  Eight Priests, carrying a great Cross, fasten'd in a great piece of timber, double-cross'd.
                  A hundred Priests and Monks, carrying every one a painted Image.
                  A great Image cover'd, carried by two men.
                  Forty Priests.
                  A great Image, adorn'd with abundance of precious Stones, carried by three men.
                  Another lesser Image.
                  Four Priests singing.
                  Another Image.

                  This Procession was occasion'd upon the finding of an Image of our Lady's in a certain place,
where, since, there is a Church built.
                  December 12. We saw a Cavalcade of seventy two Crim-Tartars,A Cavalcade of Crim-Tartars. who all took the quality
of Ambassadors, and were going to have Audience, which the Great Duke gave them, and
whereat he had the patience to endure them for the space of three hours. Being come into the
Hall of Audience, some sate on the ground, others lay along, and there was given every one
a Gobelet of Hydromel; to the two Chief of the Embassy, Garments of Brocado, to others
of Scarlet, and to the most inconsiderable among them, Cloaths of some more common Stuff,
with some Furrs, and Caps of Martins-skins, which they had upon their other cloaths, as
they return'd from Audience. 'Tis a Nation absolutely barbarous and dreadful to look on.
Though they are at a great distance from Muscon, towards the South, yet they do the
Great Duke abundance of mischief by their incursions, and the robberies they incessantly commit
upon his Subjects. The Czaar, Faedor Iuanouits, the present Great Duke's Father, endeavour'd
to prevent their incursions, by causing the Woods to be cut down, and by means of
a Causway and a Moat, which he had caus'd to be drawn a hundred leagues together, to hinder
their entrance into his Country: but they never rested till they had pull'd down one, and
fill'd the other; so that, to keep them at home, the Great Duke is oblig'd from time to time,
to suffer these Embassies, the design whereof is only to get Presents, whereof the expence
would not trouble the Great Duke, if they would keep the Barbarians quiet, but they continue
in peace but till they perceive they can make any advantage by the breach of it.
                  The 16. we had Audience,The Ambassadors have their last Audience. in order to our departure, to which we were conducted with the
same Pomp and Ceremonies as to the first, save that by reason of the Ice and Snow, which hinder
great Lords to make use of horses, they sent us two sumptuous Sledges, whereof one was
lin'd with a Crimson water'd Satin, the other, with Damask of the same colour. There were
within them some white Bears-skins, and over head rich Turkie Tapistry, to serve for a covering.

The Buckles of the Harness were cover'd of all sides with Fox-tailes, which is the richest
Ornament, that the Great Lords, nay indeed the Great Duke himself, can make use of. The
Pristafs had each his Sledge, and went on the right hand of the Ambassadors. At our alighting,
we were receiv'd by two Bojares, after the accustomed manner. As soon as the Ambassadors
were come into the Great Duke's presence, and that the Chancellor had given him an account of
their health, a seat was brought, and they were intreated to sit down. Whereupon the Chancellor
said, The Grand Seigneur, Czaar, and Great Duke, Michael Federouits, Conservator of
all the Russes, &c. tells you the Lords Ambassadors, that his Highness, Duke Frederick of
Holstein??? having sent you to his Czaarick Majesty with the Letters which he hath received, he
hath, npon your intreaty, caus'd your propositions to be communicated unto and examined by
his Bojares and Counsellors, Knez Boris Michaelouits Lukou, Vasili Iuanouits Strenou; and the
Dumnoi, Diakan, Iuan Tarassouits, and Iuan Gauarenow, upon which all sides are agreed to a
Treaty which you have signed. His Majesty hath also received the Letters you brought him
from Iohn-George, Elector of Saxony, the contents whereof he hath also considered. You shall
immediately receive his Majesties answer, both to Duke Frederick, of Holstein, and to the
Elector Iohn-George. Whererpon he deliver'd them the Letters before the Great Duke's Chair,
and the Ambassadors having receiv'd them with much respect, the Great Duke said, When the
Ambassadors shall have arriv'd at the Court of the most Serene John-George, Elector of Saxony,
and his Highness, Duke Frederick of Holstein, they will salute them from me. Which done, they
were told by the Chancellor, that his Majesty was pleas'd to grant the Ambassadors, and Gentlemen,
and Officers of their retinue, the favour of kissing his hand once more.
                  That done, they told us, we should have meat sent from the Great Duke's own Table. The
Ambassadors gave the Czaar thanks for all the favours they had receiv'd from him, wishing his
Majesty long life and a happy Government, and, to the whole house of the Czaar all prosperity.
Having taken their leaves, they return'd to their quarters. About an hour after, the meat
from the Great Duke's Table was brought, in forty six dishes, most fish, boyl'd, broyl'd, and
fry'd in Oyl, some Sallets and Pastry; but no flesh, by reason of the Fast which the Muscovites
very rigorously observe before Christmas. Knez Iuan Wolf, came along with them, to treat
us, with the same ceremonies as we were treated with at our first publick audience. After Dinner,
we were visited by the Groom of the Stables, the Butler, and the Pourveyer, who came to
demand their Presents. The Knez, the Groom, and the Butler, had each of them a drinking
Cup of Vermilion-gilt. The rest, who were about sixteen, had bestow'd among them 32. Roubles,
which amount to about 64. French Crowns.
                  The next day, the two Pristafs, accompany'd by their Interpreters, Iohn Helmes, and Andrew
Angler, of whom the former had serv'd us in our Negotiation, with the Great Duke and
the Bojares, the other, in our private affairs, came to ask us how many Horses we should stand
in need of for our return. We demanded 80. and presented each of them with a large drinking
Cup, of Vermilion-gilt. We did the like to the chief Secretary of the Chancery, and some of
the great Lords.
                  The 21. Our Pristafs presented to us another Pristaf, named Bogidan Tzergeuits Gomodof,
who had orders to conduct us to the Frontiers of Sueden.
                  The next day were brought us the Horses appointed for our journey, and at the same time
came, with one of our Pristafs, the Lord Treasurers Secretary, accompany'd by 12. Muscovites,
loaden with Martins-skins,The Czaar's present. to be presented, from the Great Duke, to the Ambassadors,
and those of their retinue. The Ambassadors had for their shares eleven Zimmers (every Zimmer
makes twenty pair) of the best kind of Sables; The Officers, Gentlemen, Pages, Harbinger,
the Clerk of the Kitchin, and the Master of the Wagons, had each a Zimmer of Martins-skins.
The rest had some two, some but one pair. We gave the Secretary a drinking Cup,
of Vermilion-gilt, and to the rest 30 Crowns. The Great Duke sent also to tell us, that if we
would make a little longer stay at Moscou, by reason of the approaching Festivals of Christmas,
and the cold weather, which indeed was to extremity, he should take it kindly, and,
though we had our dispatches, yet should we be furnish'd with the ordinary provisions; but
the desire we had to return into Germany, would not permit us to accept of his favour, so that
we put all things in readiness for our journey. To that end, we bought Sledges, that we might
travel with more convenience; they standing us in but three or four Crowns apiece. But in regard
we were to travel into Persia, having obtain'd the Great Dukes permission to do it, it was
thought fit, that Michael Cordes, with six other persons of our retinue, should be sent to
Nisa, which is a hundred Leagues from Moscou, there to order the building of such ships as
we should stand in need of, as well upon the River Wolga, as the Caspian Sea.
                  Decemb. 24. Was the day of our departure from Moscou, in order to our return. The two
Pristafs came about noon, accompany'd by a certain number of Musketiers, who had brought
with them those two Sledges, which we had made use of at our last audience, and conducted
us in very good order a quarter of a League from the City; where we took leave of them, as
also of those friends who had brought us so far on our way.
                  
                     
That day, and the night following, we made 90 Werstes, or eighteen German Leagues,
to a Village named Klin, where the next day we had a Sermon, it being Christmas day. In
the afternoon,Kln. Tuere. we parted thence, and kept on our way all night, so that the next day in the
morning, Decemb 26. we arriv'd at Tuere, where we took fresh Horses, with which departing
that night,Tarsock. Novogorod. we came the next day to Tarsock. Four days after, viz. Decemb. 31. which
was the 7th after our departure from Moscou, we came to the City of Novogorod, which is
distant from the other 120 German Leagues. Which is not to be much wondred at, for that
Muscovy is a plain Country, and during the cold weather, many times the Horses travel
upon the Snow ten or twelve German Leagues together without ever drawing bit.
               
               
                  Ianuary 1. 1635. After Prayers and Sermon, we left Novogorod, and got forwards 36
Werstes,1635. or seven Leagues, to Mokriza. The 2. We came to Tuerin, six leagues and a half.
The 3. to Orlin,JANUARY. six Leagues; the 4. to Sariza, 8 Leagues; and the night following vve made
four Leagues, to Lilienhagen, belonging to Dame Mary Stop, the Relict of Iohn Muller,
who,Mokriza. Tauerin. living, had been Agent from Sueden, in Muscovy. We were very vvell treated there; and
the next day we got seven Leagues, and came to Narva.
                  The 6. We sent away our baggage.Orlin. Sariza. Lilienhagen. Narva. Reuel. The Ambassadors follow'd the next day, and three
days after, viz. the 10. we came to Reuel, vvhence we stirr'd not for the space of three weeks.
But considering at last, that the Baltick Sea was not Navigable that time of the year, and being
withal unwilling to stay there the rest of the Winter,Narva. vve conceiv'd it vvould be our best
course to be gone thence with the soonest,Reuel. and to prosecute our journey by Land, through Prussia,
Pomerania, and Mecklenbourg.
                  The Ambassadors left Reuel Ian. 30. having tabled most of their retinue with Mr. Henry Kosen,
and vvith a retinue of ten persons, took their way to Riga The two first nights vve pass'd
over at Kegel, a house belonging to Iohn Muller, Counsellor of the City of Reuel, my Father-in-law;
vvhere vve vvere very vvell entertain'd.
                  Feb. 2. vve came to Parnau, at vvhich place God was pleased to favour me with a great deliverance,
vvhich vvas thus; discharging their Canon at our entrance, the Tampion, which they
had forgotten to take out of one of the pieces, pass'd very near me, and struck against the vvall
of the City Gate, where it broke, the splinters of it flying about my head with such violence,
that, being stunn'd thereby, it was half an hour ere I recover'd my self.
                  The City of Parnau is but a small one,FEBRUARY. but hath a good Castle, built of wood, and after the
Muscovian fortification; to which the Houses, the Gates, and the Churches are suitable. It
is seated upon the little River of ParnauThe Description of Parnau. of Parnou, which gives it the name, and which rising
out of the great Forrest near the little River Beca and the Castle of Weissenstein, and receiving
in its passage the waters of the Rivers Fela and Pernkeia, disembougues it self into the Baltick
Sea, near this City, which is divided into two parts, the Old and the New. 'Tis numbred
among the Hanseatick Towns, though it hath not in a manner any other Commerce than that
of Wheat. Eric, K. of Sueden, took it from the Poles, in the year 1562. but they recovered
it again by stratagem, in the year 1565. The Muscovites became Masters of it Iuly 9. 1575.
but it was re-united to the Crown of Poland, with the rest of Livonia, by the Treaty of Peace
made between that Crown and the Great Duke. In the year 1617. the Suedes took it, and
have kept it ever since.
                  We met there with the Countess Dowager La Tour, named Magdalene, of the house of
Hardek, in Austria. The Ambassadors sent me, with tvvo more of our retinue to complement
her, and to make proffers of service to her in their names. She took it so kindly, that not
content to make us drink his Highnesse's health three times over, she forc'd us to take the bovvls
out of her ovvn hands, and in the mean time entertain'd us vvith much excellent discourse, in
commendation of his Highness and that Embassy; as also concerning the manners and Religion
of the Muscovites, vvith a svveetness and gravity vvhich cannot vvell be express'd. She vvould
needs have the young Counts, Christian, and Henry, her sons, go to the Inn vvhere the Ambassadors
vvere Lodg'd, to complement them??? vvhich the young Lords perform'd handsomly;
and to heighten their civility, they also stay'd Supper vvith them.
                  The next day, the Countess sent us all manner of Provisions, and Letters for Count Mathew
Henry de la Tour, her father-in-lavv. She sent also to desire the Ambassadors to recommend
her sons to his Highness, and to assure him of their services, when they should be of an age,
and in a capacity to do him any. As we were getting on hors-back, our Host shew'd himself
an honest man, and refus'd to take our money, telling us, the Countess had sent in most of
the Provisions for the Ambassadors Supper, and that the rest was not worth the reckoning:
so that to require his sincerity we gave him twenty Crowns. But we were not got a League off
the City, ere we were overtaken by a man he had sent, to return us our money, and to tell
us the Present was too small, in requital of the trouble we had given him. We sent back our
Harbinger, with the Messenger, who gave the Host twelve Crowns more, wherewith he
seem'd to be satisfy'd.
                  
                     
The 6. We enter'd Riga.1635. The next day, the Governour visited the Ambassadors, and the 10.
he made a great Feast for them,The Ambassadors come to Riga. to which he invited the chiefest of the City. Some days following
were also spent in Feasting, among some or other of our friends.
                  Febr. 13. The Ambassadors left Riga, having in their Company a certain Ambassador of
France, who was called Charles de Tallerand, and assum'd the quality of Marquess of Exidueil,
Prince of Chalais, Count of Grignol, Baron of Marueil and Boswille. Lewis xiii. King of
France and Navarre, had sent him with Iames Roussel upon an Embassy into Turky and Muscovy.
But Roussel, his Collegue, had done him such ill Offices with the Patriarch, that the Great
Duke sent him to Siberia, where he continu'd three years a prisoner; till such time, as the malice
and artifices of Roussel, who endeavour'd nothing so much as to inflame the differences between
the Princes, being discover'd, he was set at liberty, after the Partiarch's death. During
his restraint, his diversion had been to learn by heart the four first books of Vergil's Aeneids,
which he had, as they say, ad unguen. He was a person of an excellent good humour, aged
about 36. years.
                  We took our way through Courland,Mittau. and came the 4. about noon to Mittau. This little City
is situated in that part of Courland, which is called Semgalles, six Leagues from Riga, and it
is the place where the Duke ordinarily resides.Courland made a Dutchy. The Dutchy of Courland was some time part of
Livonia, from which it is divided by the River Dune: but all this Province having been miserably
ruin'd by the Suedes and Muscovites, and the Archbishop of Riga and the Master of the
Teutonick Order having submitted to the Crown of Poland, with all they were still possess'd of
there, Sigismond Augustus, King of Poland, rais'd Courland to a Dutchy, and gave it to Godard
Ketler, of Nesselrot, last Master of the Teutonick Order in Livonia, to be held immediately
from the Crown of Poland. Godard dies, May 17. 1587. leaving, by Anne, the Daughter of
Albert Duke of Meklenbourg, two sons, Frederick, who died without issue, and William, who
succeeded his brother in the Dutchy of Courland. This William having been dispossess'd by Sigismond
III. and the States of Poland, was forc'd to live in Exile, till that, upon the mediation
of several Foreign Princes, he was re-establish'd in the year 1619. During the first War
between Poland and Sueden, the City of Mittau was taken by the Suedes, who fortifi'd it, and
restor'd it not to the Duke of Courland, till oblig'd thereto by a Cessation agreed on between
those two Crowns, in the year 1629. Iames (William's son) who now hath the Dutchy, and
assumes the quality of the Duke of Courland, Lvonia, and Semgalles, is married to Louise-Charlotte,
Daughter to George-William, Elector of Brandenbourg, and Elizabeth-Charlotte, of Baviere.
It is not long since, that this Duke of Courland, having dispatch'd a Gentleman for Moscou, to
manage some affairs there, the Weywode of Tleslau would not give him passage, and sent him
word, that Courland being dependent on the Crown of Poland, could not have particular Agents
and Ministers, but was to negotiate Affairs by means of the Ambassador, which the King his
Master had at Muscovy. But this Prince hath been so fortunate, as, since this last War, to
obtain the neutrality of all the neighbouring Princes, so that it is very likely, the Treaty to
be agreed on between them will be such, as that he shall have no dependance on any of them.
                  At night we came to a Village,Doblen. called Doblen, three Leagues from Mittau. The Innkeeper,
who took us for Souldiers or Gypsies that were in distress for Lodging, made some difficulty
to let us into his house: but at last he was perswaded, and lodg'd us. All we had to supper,
was, hard Cheese, very brown Bread, and sour Beer.
                  The 15. we travell'd 7. Leagues,Bador??? and came to Bador, in Poland, where an antient Gentleman,
who had sometime been a Captain of horse, named Iohn Amdod, lodg'd us, and treated us extremely
well, especially with all sorts of drinks, as Lithuanian Hydromel, excellent Sack, and
good Beer, which made us spend some part of the night in carowsing: the Wine having the
vertue of contracting a great friendship between the Ambassadors and him. The next day he
gave us a very sumptuous entertainment, and the divertisement of Timbrells; and that all might
be compleat, in the treatment, he would needs bring in his two Daughters, whom we had not
seen the night before. He also presented the Ambassadors, one with a Fire-lock, the other
with a Sword: and the Ambassadors gave him each of them a fair Watch. This breakfast,
which lasted till the afternoon, hindred us so, that we could get but four Leagues that day, to
Hashoff,Hashof. where we went to bed supperless. The 18. we travell'd six Leagues, to a Village
called Walzau.Walzau.
                  
                  The 9. we came to Memel,Memel. six Leagues from 'Tis a pleasant little Town, at the
entrance of the Gulf called the Courishaf, or Lake of Courland. The Courlanders, in their Jargon,
call this Town Cleupeda, and Crometus, in his History of Poland, calls it Troipes. The
Castle belonging to it is pleasant, and well fortify'd, and its Haven very commodious. The River
Tange compasses it round, and not far thence falls into the Gulf. It was built in the year
1250. and was at that time part of the revinue of Livonia. The Friers of the Order of Livonia,
in the year 1328. sold this City to the Master of the Order of Prussia, and it is, with that
Dutchy, come to the Elector of Brandenburg, who hath been possess'd of it, ever since the
Suedes restor'd it, by vertue of a cessation of 26. years, which France got concluded, in the

year 1635. between the Crowns of Poland and Sueden. The 20. we got upon the Haf, or
Gulf of Curland, and dind??? that day at Snenzel,Swenzel. three leagues from Memel, and lodg'd at
BulcapenBulcapen. five leagues from the said Memel.
                  The 21. we travel'd 8 leagues, and came to Koningsberg???Koningsberg. where, the snow beginning to fail
us, we were forc'd to quit our Sledges. This city, called by the Polanders Krolefsky, is
seated by the River Pregel, the chiefest of that part of Prussia, which is called the Ducal, because
it hath its Duke, or particular Prince, under the Soveraignty of the Crown of Poland.
'Tis a Production of the thirteenth age, in which the Knights of the Teutonick Order built it,
and named it Coningsberg, or Royal-mount, in honour of Primislas Ottocarus, King of Bohemia,
and in acknowledgement of the assistance he had brought them against the Heathens in
those parts. It is now much bigger than it was then, inasmuch as, besides the suburbs, which
are very great, there was added in the year 1300. that part of the city which is called Lebenicht,
and in the year 1380. that of Kniphof, both which have their several Magistrates, both as to
policy and administration of Justice. The Palace ows its perfection to George Frederick, of
Brandenburgh, Duke of Prussia, who built it, about the later end of the last age. Among other
remarkable things, there is a Hall, that hath no pillars, and yet is 274 Geometrical feet
in length, and 59 in breadth; and a fair Library well furnish'd with abundance of excellent
Books; among which, in drawers full of Books adorn'd with silver, is to be seen, that which
Albert of Brandenbourg, first Duke of Prussia, made and writ with his own hand, for the
instruction of his Son, and goverment of the country, after his death. The University was
founded by the same Prince, who made it his business to render this city one of the most considerable
of all the North, The River Pregel, or Chronus, which rises in Lithuania, and falls into the
Gulf, called the Frishaf, a league below the City, contributes very much to the improvement of
its commerce; and the City is so populous, that many times there are seven or eight families in
a house. They generally speak the German language, though there are few Iahabitants but
have also the Polish, with those of Lithuania and Courland. There are brought thithes, from
oland and Lithuania, Oak for Joyners work, Soap-ashes, Wax, Honey, Hydromel, Leather,
Furrs, Wheat, Rye, Flax, and Hemp; and the Suedish, Dutch, and English Ships, bring Iron,
Lead, Tinn Cloath, Wine, Salt, Butter, Cheese, &c. We say nothing here of Prussia, out of
a fear of making too great a digression, and medling with ought relating to the History of Germany,
which hath nothing common with our Travells; but only, that the Crown of Poland
hath quitted all pretension of Soveraignty over the Dutchy of Prussia, by the last treaty it made
with his Electoral Highness of Brandenbourg.
                  We left Coningsberg, Feb. 24. and came the next day to Elbing,Elbing. a City seated upon a River
of the same name, between the Lake of Drauser, and the Frishaf, in the Royal, or Polish
Prussia. It is not very big, but its streets are streight and spacious; and its fortifications, made
by the late King of Sueden, during the last War of Poland, before his entrance into Germany,
are very regular. If he who is Master of it, were also Commander of the Fort of Pilau, which
the Elector of Brandenburg is possess'd of, at the entrance of the Frishaf, it might be made a very
considerable place for Commerce.
                  The 27. we came to Dantsig,Dantsig. where we staid 16 or 17 days, during which time, the Magistrates
treated us with the ordinary Presents of refreshments, and the principal Inhabitants
gave us several noble entertainments. The Polanders call this place Gdansko, whence comes
the modern Latine word Gedanum. It is not very antient, and yet it cannot be certainly affirm'd
whether it was built by the Dukes of Pomerania, or by the Danes, since it seems to have
its name from the later. It was a long time possess'd by the Dukes of Pomerania, and afterwards
by the Kings of Poland, and by the Masters of the Teutonick Order in Prussia. In the year 1454
it redeem'd it self out of subjection to the Order, and made a voluntary rendition of it self to
Casimir, King of Poland. It is situated in Cassuba, upon the Vistula, and Rodauna, which
they say is the Eridanus of the Antients (because in that place there is found much yellow amber)
and near the Moslava, which falls into the Vistula, a quarter of a league below the City.
But the River is so shallow there, that great Ships cannot come up to the City:
Towards the West, it hath several mounts of sand, which they were forc'd to bring
within the fortifications, because they commanded the city: though Canon cannot
be discharg'd to any great purpose, when they shoot point-blank downwards, and that
there would not have been space enough between the mount and the ditch, to put forces in order,
and to give an assault. Towards the South and North, it hath a pleasant Plain, and on
the East, the River. It is well built, but the streets not over-clean. The publick Structures are
magnificent, and those of private persons very commodious, and handsome. On the other
side of the Moslava, lies part of the Suburbs, called Schotland, or Scotland, as large as a
pretty little City, but it depends not on the City of Dantsig, but on the Bishop of Cujavia. It
hath its seat and suffrage in the Diets of Poland, even in those which are called for the election
of the King. 'Tis one of the four Cities, which have the superintendency of all the Teutonick
Association, or Hanseatick Towns, and hath so many other Privileges, that, though it contributes

to Poland, and gives the King half the duties raised there, yet does it in a manner enjoy
an absolute freedome. There is so great a Commerce of Wheat in this City, that it is
thought, there are sold every year above seven hundred and thirty thousand Tuns, whereof
two make a Last. The Magistracy consists of fourteen Senators, and four Burgomasters;
whereto are to be added the Governour, appointed by the King of Poland, some Escheuins, or
Sheriffs, for civil and criminal causes, and a hundred Counsellors for affairs of importance.
Criminal causes are finally judged, without admitting any appeal, as also Civil, not exceeding
a thousand Livers. It makes Statutes, and imposes taxes upon the Inhabitants, according
to the exigencies of publick Affairs, without staying for any superiour Permission,
and regulates the exercise of those Religions that are permitted by the Laws of the
Empire.
                  March 16. We left Dantsig, and came the 25 to Stetin,It Stetin??? the chief City of Pomerania.
is at 53 deg. 27. min. latitude, and 38 d. 45. m. longitude, seated in a very pleasant place,
upon the descent of a Hill. The River Oder divides it self there into four branches, whereof
that which runs by the City keeps its name (the others taking those of Parnits, and the greater
and lesser Kegelitz) and straggles so, as that to come to the City from Dam-side, a man
must pass over six bridges, which, put together, are in length, 996 German ells, and 24 foot
broad, and are all joyn'd by a noble Causey, well paved, and having in the middle a Royal
Fort. The structures of it are beautiful, and it is excellently well fortify'd, especially since
the Suedes became Masters of it. Iohn Frederick Duke of Pomerania, in the year 1575. laid
the first foundations of the sumptuous Palace which is there built after the Italian Architecture,
with very noble appartements, where, before these last Warrs, there were worth the seeing,
a noble Library, a Magazine of Arms, many rarities, and the rich Wardrop and Plate of the
Dukes of Pomerania. 'Tis one of the Hanseatick Towns, and enjoyes many great Privileges,
among others, that of obliging strangers to disburthen in the City all the Merchandises which
pass through it, what nature soever they are of: as also that the Gentlemen thereabouts cannot
build any Castle or strong place any way within three Leagues from it; nay, that the Dukes
of Pomerania themselves cannot build any Fort upon the Oder, or the Suine, or upon the
Frishaf, between that and the Sea. But this advantage is lost by it's coming into the hands of the Suedes.
                  Mar. 29. being Easter-day, we came to Rostock,Rostock. a City seated on the River Warne, in the
Dutchy of Meklnbourg, where heretofore lived the people called the Varini. Pribisi II. the son
of Niclot, last Prince of the Obotrites, incompass'd it with a wall, in the year 1160. and made
it a City out of the ruins of that of Kessin, which Henry le Lyon, Duke of Saxony, had destroy'd.
Its Port is not commodious, in regard Vessels of burthen are forc'd to unload at Warnemunde,
two Leagues below the City, at the mouth of the River. The City is handsome enough, having
three great Market-places, 27 streets, 14 little gates, and four great gates. Its University
is one of the most antient in all Germany, and was founded, by Iohn and Albert, Cousin-Germans,
Dukes of Mecklenbourg, who, together with the Magistrate, opened it in the year 1419.
Among its Professors are many very great Persons, of whom one was Albert Crantz Rector of
it in the year 1482. This City, having been taken by the Imperialists, in the year 1629. with
all the rest of the Dutchy of Mecklenbourg, the late King of Sueden, Gustavus Adolphus, besieg'd it
in the year 1631. and took it the 16. of Octob. the same year.
                  The 30. of March, we left Rostock, and came the same day to Wismar,Wismar. seven Leagues. Those
who say this City was built by Wismar, King of the Vandals about the year 340. tell a fabulous
story, whereof the vanity is so much the more visible, in that it is certain, that it was no
City, till Henry of Ierusalem, Duke of Mecklenbourg, made it such, by the privileges he bestow'd
on it, in the year 1266. It is near as big as Rostock, and its Port, which no doubt is one
of the best upon the Baltick Sea, brings it very great Traffick. Its situation, being amidst Fenns,
and upon the Sea, is very advantageous, and its Citadel fortify'd with five regular Bastions,
makes it one of the most considerable places in all Germany. Adolphus Frederick, Duke of
Mecklenbourg, and General Todt, took it, Ian. 10. 1632. from Colonel Gramma, who had
the command of it, for the D. of Fridland; ever since which time the Suedes have kept it, as one
of the most precious Jewels of their Crown.
                  The last of March, we came to the Castle of Schonberg,Schonberg belonging to the Duke of Mecklenbourg,
where some friends of our Comrade, Iohn Albert de Mandelslo, received us, and treated
us very nobly. For my part, I am particularly oblig'd to acknowledge their kindness, for,
being casually shot in the arm with a pistol by one of our company, I was forc'd to stay there
two or three dayes, during which time I receiv'd very great civilities from them.
                  Apr. 1APRIL??? the Ambassadors left Schonberg, but M. Mandelslo and my self stay'd two dayes after
them, and the third of April overtook them at Lubeck.Lubeck. This City is so well known, that I need not
give any particular description of it, after so many other Authors that have written of it. Only I
shall say, that it is situated between the Rivers of Traue and Wagenits, at 28. d. 20. m. longitude,
and at 54. d. 48. m. latitude, two leagues from the Baltick Sea. Those who have chiefly contributed

to the building of it, were, Adolphus II. Count of Holstein, Henry le Lion, Duke of
Saxony, and Henry Bishop of Aldenbourg. The Emperor Frederick I. re-united it to the Empire,
and Frederick II. his Grand-Son, gave it some of those Privileges, which it enjoyes to this
day. It lies in the Wagria, at the entrance of the Country of Holstein, and is very well fortify'd,
according to the modern fortification, having, besides the other advantages which it hath
equally with the other Imperial Towns, that of the oversight of the Teutonick Association,
whereof all the Archivi are kept in the Guild-Hall of this City. How considerable it is in the
Empire, may be judg'd by the contributions it payes towards the charges of the journey to Rome,
which amount to 21 horsemen, and 177 foot, and, reduc'd to money to 1980 Livers a mouth.
As for its rank at the Diets, it hath a place alternatively with the city of Wornes. In this city
the Peace between the Emperor Ferdinand II. and Christian IV. King of Denmark, was concluded,
in the year 1629. The Bishoprick of Wagria, which was transferr'd from Aldenbourg
to this city, is now possess'd by Iohn, Duke of Holstein, brother to Frederick, Duke of Holstein,
who lives at Oitin. Here also I escaped another great misfortune; as I alighted off my
horse, I fell upon my wounded arm, but ere I could get up again, Mandelslo's horse, which
was furious and skittish, startingthereat, stood up on his hinder feet, and very narrowly miss'd
my head with his fore-feet. We travel'd on, in the Afternoon, and came that night to an Inn in
the suburbs of Arnsbock.Arnsbock. This little city, lying in Wagria, between Lubeck and Pretz, belonged
heretofore to the Carthusians; but now it is possess'd by Ioachin Ernest, Duke of Holstein,
by the branch of Sounderborg, who is married to Dorothea Augusta, our Prince's Sister. Upon
which accompt it was that he sent a coach and six horses to bring us to the Castle, where the
Ambassadors and some of the retinue supp'd at his own Table, and lay there the night
following.
                  The next day we broke our fast at the Castle, which done, we were brought in the Duke's
coach to our Inn, whence we continued our journey, and got the same day to Pretz,Pretz. where
there is a very rich and sumptuous Monastery of young Ladies Nobly descended, who are maintain'd
there, till they leave the place to embrace a married life.
                  April 6. about noon, we came to Kiel,Kiel. a city situated upon the Baltick Sea, and famous
for a Fair kept there yearly at Twelf-tide, which brings thither all the Nobility about the country,
and a very great number of Merchants. We got the same night to Gottorp,Gottorp. for which we
are to give Almighty God our humble thanks; and the next day, the Ambassadors made a report
of their negotiation. And so much by way of accompt of our first Voyage into Muscovy.
               
            
            
               
               THE
TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, and PERSIA.
               The Second Book.
               
                  HIs Highness had no sooner understood,1635. that the Great Duke of Muscovy had
permitted his Ambassadors to pass through his country, to go into Persia, but
all his thoughts were busied about the prosecution of the second Voyage,Preparatives for the second Voyage.
whereof the expence was incredible, which he gives order for, causing all necessary
preparations to be made, and presents to be fought out worthy so great a
Monarch.
                  He also augmented the Ambassadors retinue, and ordered, that, till the
time of their departure, the Gentlemen, Officers, and Servants, should be entertain'd at
Hambooough, at the house of Otton Brugman, one of the Ambassadors; where they were very
well treated, every one according to his condition and quality, the Trumpet always sounding
when the meat was carried up, which was also done all along the Voyage.
                  The retinue consisted of a Mareshal,The Ambassadors retinue. or Steward, a Secretary of the Embassy, four Gentlemen
of the Chamber, and eight other Gentlemen for ordinary attendance, among whom were
the Minister and interpreter, four Pages of the Chamber, four other Pages, four Grooms of
the Chamber, four Masicians, a Controler, a Harbinger, two Sumpter-men, an Overseer
of the Servants, two Trumpetters, two Watch-makers, eight Halbaldiers, who were of several
professions, as Bakers, Shoe-makers, Taylors, Smiths, Sadlers, &c. ten Laqueys,
a Clark for the Kitchin, with two Head-cooks, and one Under-cook, a Master of the Waggons
and his Servant, ten Servants belonging to the Gentlemen, an Interpreter for the Muscovian
Language, another for the Persian, and a third for the Turkish. The Sumpter-men, the
Musicians, and the Trumpeters had also their boys, eight in number, besides twelve other
persons for the ordering of things belonging to the Ship, and 30 Souldiers, and four Muscovian
Officers, with their Servants, whom we eatertain'd into our service in Muscovy, with
the Great Duke's permission.
                  All Summer,They embark. and some part of Autumn, were spent in preparation for this Voyage, insomuch
that we could not get from Hamborough, till the 21 of October 1635. The 24 we got to
Lubeck, where we staid two days, during which, our Baggage, and Horses, which were 12.
were embark'd at Trauemunde. The 27. we followed, and went aboard about noon, with all
our people, into a new Ship, that had never been at Sea before. The wind serv'd as well as
could be wish'd, to get out of the Harbour, and yet we met with such a strong current of water,
that we could not avoid falling foul on two great Ships that were in the Port, between which
we were so intangled, that we could not in three hours dis-engage our selves. Which many

among us took for an ill omen of the misfortune that happen'd to us some few dayes after.
                  Oct. 28. about five in the morning, after prayers said, we set sail with a West-South-West
wind, which growing higher at noon, was at night heightned to a dreadful Tempest. It continu'd
all night, during which, we discover'd, that our Mariners were as raw as the Ship was
new, which had never seen the Sea till that time; and it was our continual fear that the Mast
would slip out of its place, in as much as, the ropes, being new, stretch'd so, that they seem'd not to
have any hold of it.
                  The 29. we found our selves to be on the Coasts of Denmark, which our Captain took for
the Isle of Bornholm, and we perceived, that we had directed our course streight towards the
Country of Schonen; so that if we had not at the break of day, discover'd Land, and found we
were at 4. fathom water, which soon oblig'd us to alter our course, there had been an end of
both us and our Ship. About 9. of the clock we discover'd the Island of Bornholm, and the wind
being fair, made all the fail we could. But about ten at night, when we thought our selves most
secure, and made accompt to rest our selves after the precedent night's toil, even, while Brugman,
one of the Ambassadors, was charging the Master's Mate to be carefull, and the other answer'd,
there was no danger, since we had Sea-room enough, the Ship, being then under all the
sail she could make,The Ship strikes against a Rock. struck against a Rock which was cover'd by the water. The shock made
such a horrible noise, that it made all start up. The amazement we were in surpris'd us so, that
there was not any one but might easily be perswaded, that the end of both his Voyage and Life
were neer at hand.
                  At first we knew not where we were, and in regard the Moon was but newly chang'd, the night
was so dark, that we could not see two paces from us, We put our antern at the Castle, and
caus'd some Muskets to be discharg'd, to see if there were any help to be had neer us. But no
body made answer, and the Ship beginning to lye on one side, our affliction began to turn into
despair; so that most cast themselves on their knees, begging of God, with horrid cries, that he
would send them that relief which they could not expect from men.
                  The Master himself wept most bitterly, and would meddle no further with the conduct of the
Ship. The Physician and my self were sitting one close by the other, with a design to embrace
one another, and to die together, as old and faithful friends, in case we should be wrack'd. Others
took leave one of another, or made vows to God, which they afterwards so Religiously
kept, that coming to Reuel, they made up a portion for a Poor, but Virtuous Maid, who was
married there. The Ambassador Crusius's Son mov'd most compassion. He was but 12. years of
age, and he had cast himself upon the ground, importuning Heaven with incessant cries and lamentations,
and saying, Son of David have mercy on me; whereto the Minister added, Lord, if
thou wilt not hear us, be pleas'd to hear this Child, and consider the innocence of his age. At
last God was so gracious as to preserve us, though the Ship struck several times, with great violence,
against the Rock.
                  About one in the morning, we saw fire, whence we inferr'd that we were not far from Land.
The Ambassadors commanded the Boat to be cast out, with design to get into it, with each of
them a Servant, and to go streight towards the fire, to see if there were any means to save the
rest: but no sooner had they thrown in two Cabinets, in which were the Credential Letters and
some Jewels, ere it was full of water, which had almost occasion'd the loss of two of our people,
who had leapt first into it, thinking to save themselves; in so much that they had much
ado to get into the Ship ere the Boat sunk. We were forc'd to continue there the rest of that
night, expecting to see a period of that danger.
                  At break of day we discover'd the Isle of Oleand, and saw the ruins of a Danish Ship, which
had been cast away thereabouts a month before. The wind being somewhat abated, two Fishermen
of the Isle came aboard us, and Landed the Ambassadors, having a very considerable reward
for their pains, and after them, some of their retinue.
                  About noon, we found the two Cabinets, and when the Sea was a little calm'd, many people
of the Isle came in to our relief, to get off our Ship from among those Rocks: but with this
misfortune, that as they would have let down the Anchor, which they had carried in the Boat
about a hundred paces from the Ship, the Boat over-turn'd, so that those in it were toss'd into
the Sea. Our Masters Mate went immediately with one of the Isle boats to their relief; and in
regard, as they were over-turn'd, some caught hold of the Boat, others of an Oar, or somewhat
else, as also that the Wine they had drunk a little before, had somewhat heightned their Courage,
we had the time to send twice to them, and to save all but our Carpenter, who was lost
for want of having fasten'd on somewhat that might have kept him above water.
                  While they were getting off our Ship, the waters increas'd so, as that the wind, coming to the
North-West, made our passage thence into the Sea the easier. Whither we were no sooner
gotten, but the wind turn'd again to South-West, and brought us safely through the streight of
Calmer,The streight of Calmer. which is so much the more dangerous in that season of the year, in as much as the Sea
thereabouts is full of Rocks, and that even in the Summer time, it is ill sailing there by reason
of the banks of Sand. The Ship stay'd for the Ambassadors, at Calmer, whither they got by

Land, upon the first of November,NOVEM. and came aboard neer an old ruin'd fort, called Ferstat.
                  Being come to Calmer, we sent back a Page and a Lacquey to Gottorp, to get other Credentials,
the Sea-water having spoil'd those we had at first. It was there also taken into consideration,
whether it were not our best course to take our way by Land, through Sueden, or prosecute
our Voyage by Sea. The latter was resolv'd on; and that we might do it with the less
danger, we laid out for a skilfull Master for the Baltick Sea; but there being none to be had,
we took only two Pilots, who conducted us half a League through the Sand banks, till we
were got into the main Sea.
                  The 3. we continu'd our course, and pass'd by a Rock called, the Suedish Lady, which we
left on the lar-board. From Calmer thither are accounted eight Leagues.
                  About noon, we spy'd the Castle of Bornholm, in the Isle of Oeland. At night we doubled
the point of the Isle, with such a Tempest from the North-East, that the fore-part of the Ship
was more under water than above it, and ever and anon our sails were wash'd by the Waves.
                  Another misfortune was, that our Pump was out of order, in so much that till it could be
made to do its Office, all the Kettles and other Vessels were little enough to empty out the water.
This trouble lasted till the next day at noon, with so much danger to us, that if the wind
had not chang'd, it would have been impossible for us to escape shipwrack. But the wind being
somewhat better for us than it had been, we kept on our course, and came towards night in sight
of Gotland.
                  The Isle of Gotland is opposite to the Province of Scandinavia,The Isle of Gotland. or Schoven, which hath also
the same name given it, at 58. degr. of Latitude. It is in length 18. German Leagues; in
breadth, between three and four. The Country is full of Rocks, Firre-Trees,  Juniper-Trees,
having East-wards, many commodious Havens; as those of Ostergaar, Sleidaf, Sanduig,
Naruig, and Heiligolm. Ostergaar is a small Isle standing at an equal distance from the two
points of the great one, with a convenient Harbour, for those who can avoid the Sand-banks,
which thereabouts reach out a good way into the Sea. Sleidaf is higher towards the North, than
Ostergaar, and hath a safe Har against all winds, the Ships lying under the shelter of four
little Isles, or rather Mounts , which break the violence of the Waves. There's but one
Town in all the Island; but there are above 500. Farms, and the Churches are built within a
League distance one of another, as they are in the Isle of Oeland, so that the Steeples give a great
direction to the Ships that sail that way. The Inhabitants are Danes, and the Island was subject
to the King of Denmark, till that after a tedious War it submitted to the Crown of Sueden,
to which it payes annually 100. lasts of Pitch. All their Traffick lies in Cattel, and Wood, for
building and fire, and thence the best deal Boards come. I would needs, with some other Camerades,
go and see the Town of Wisby. It is built on the descent of a Rock, upon the Sea side,
encompass'd with a good Wall, and fortify'd with some bastions. The ruins of 14. Churches,
and several Houses, Gates, and Walls of Free-stone and Marble, which we observ'd there, argue
it hath been bigger than it now is. It is said, that the foundations of it were laid, about the
end of the eighth Age, and that it hath been since so populous, that it had 12000. Inhabitants,
for the most part Merchants, not accounting the Danes, Suedes, Vandols, Saxons, Muscovites,
Iews, Greeks, Prussians, Poles, and Livonians, who traded thither. There, they say, were made
the first Orders concerning maritime affairs, which Lubeck, and the other Hanseatick Cities still
make use of; But now the Port is quite lost, so as that Ships cannot get into it.
                  The 5. the wind became more boisterous than before, so that the Vessel, at every great Sea,
was all under water. About 10. at night, we sounded, at 12. fathom; whereupon we chang'd
our course, and got into the main Sea, for fear of running against the Land, which if we had,
we must needs have been cast away.
                  The 6. we met a Holland Vessel, which directed us towards the Isle of Tageroort,Tageroort??? whither we
came at night; but, the same night, we were again forc'd into the main Sea.
                  The 7. at noon, we were upon the point of Tageroort; but the Masters Mate was mistaken,
who, thinking the wind would have carried us North-ward, would perswade us it was Oetgensholm,Oetgensholm.
and upon that presumption, imprudently engag'd himself in a most dangerous passage,
called the Hondeshuig.Hondeshuig. He was not convinc'd of his error, till he saw the Church-Steeple; so
that we were forc'd to return into the main, with greater hazard than we had run, at our entrance
into that passage. That day, we met a bark, which had lost its course; so that understanding
we intended for Reuel, she follow'd us a while, but at night left us, and cast Anchor
before Tageroort, and, as we heard since, came safely the next day to Reuel. All the afternoon
we lost not sight of the coasts of Livonia, and at night were within a League of the Isle of Narga,Narga.
which is at the entrance of the Haven of Reuel. Our Master and his Mate, would ueither
go into, nor anchor before Tageroort, choosing rather the main Sea, though in a great Tempest,
which kept us in action all that night, and took away our Main-mast, which was soon follow'd
by the Mizen, and the fore-castle, and it was no less than a miracle, that our compass was left
us, without which it had been impossible for us to have kept on our intended course.
                  The 8. we perceiv'd that we had pass'd the Haven of Reuel, and about ten, the weather became

to foul, that it seem'd rather an Earthquake, that should turn the World upside down,
than a storm. Our danger and fears encreas'd till three in the afternoon, that one of the Seamen
having got up into the scuttle of the sprit-sale, told us, he discover'd Hogland. We got
thither by 7 at night, and cast Anchor at 19 fathom water. There we stayd the 9. and resolved,
that thence-forward, Prayers should be said twice a day, to give God thanks for our deliverance
the day before, from a danger we could not have avoided, otherwise than by passing
among the Rocks upon the Coasts of Finland, as we must have resolv'd to do, if we had not
discover'd that Island. The Ambassadors went ashore, to observe the situation of the Country,
and refresh themselves. At night it was consider'd, whether we should continue our Voyage
by Sea to Narva, or return to Reuel; but the diversity of Opinions was such, that nothing was
resolv'd on. About 9 at night, the Master came to the Ambassadors Lodgings, to tell them,
that the wind being East, and forcing the Ship towards the Shore, he saw no liklier way to be
safe than by making for Reuel. The Ambassadors bade him do what he thought most convenient,
and went aboard: but as they were weighing Anchor, the wind riss so, that there was no possibility
of taking the course intended, so that the Master and his Counsel chang'd their design,
and thought it best to ly still at Anchor, for fear of running-a-ground. But all to no purpose.
For being near the shore, the Orders given could not be put in execution with diligence enough
to avoid shipwrack. All could be done was to let down the Boat, and to set the Ambassadors
ashore with some of their retinue. After the Ship had struck several times against
certain pieces of Rocks, whereof there is abundance all along the Coast, it split and
sunk. All the men were sav'd, a good part of the goods, and seven horses, whereof two
dy'd the  day.
                  We shelter'd our selves in Fishers huts, along the Sea-side, where we met with some Livenians
that dwelt thereabouts who could speak nothing but the jargon of the country. That poor
refuge sav'd their lives who had escap'd the wrack; else, their cloaths being all wet about them,
most of them would have been starv'd to death in the snow, which fell the night following.
                  The 10. we thought fit to try whether any more of the goods could be gotten out of the Ship;
but the rough weather continuing, none would venture going near it with a Boat, till that in
the afternoon some things were gotten out. Our Cloaths, Books, and other things we laid out
a-drying, the Sea water having injur'd some, and utterly spoil'd others.
                  The greatest of our losses was that of a Clock, worth four thousand crowns, which the
horses had broke to pieces, by striving to get loose.
                  This misfortune was follow'd by another, which though we saw at some distance, yet distracted
us no less; and that was, want of provisions. The Sea-water had spoil'd ours, and
our fear was, that the frost forcing us to winter in the Island, we must either be starved, or reduc'd
to the extremities of feeding on the barks of trees, as some that had been cast away there
some years before, were constrain'd to do. We had but little bread left, and the Bisket was
so soak'd in Salt-water, that we were forc'd to boyl it in fresh, with a little Cummin or Fennel,
and so made a Pottage of it for our Servants. One day, we took in a Brook which falls
from the Mountains, as many small Fishes as found us two good meals.
                  HoglandThe Island of Hogland. hath its name from the height of its situation, it being seen a great way into the Sea,
and is about 3 leagues in length, and one, in breadth. You see nothing but Rocks, Firr-trees,
and Thorns. We indeed saw some few Hares, which in Winter turn white, as they do all over
Livonia; but our Dogs could not follow them through the VVoods, and over the
Rocks.
                  In the mean time, it was reported at Reuel, that we were all lost, rais'd by this, that there
had been dead bodies found upon the coast of Livonia, clad in red, which was our Livery; as
also with this addition, that, the Bark, spoken of before, had related, that she had seen us carried
away with the storm beyond the bay of Reuel. Besides, it was eight days before they heard
from us; so that those of our people whom we had left there, at our return from Muscovy,
were seeking out other services, when M. Vchterits (then Chamberlain to the Ambassadors,
and now Gentleman of the Privy-chamber to his Highness of Holstein at Gottorp) brought them
an accompt of us. We had the convenience to send him thither in one of the two Finland barks,
which the tempest had forc'd to that Island on the 3 of November.
                  The 17. The Ambassadors embark'd themselves,A dangerous attempt of the Ambassadors. each of them with a retinue of five persons,
in two Fisher-boats, to pass over to the continent, from which this Island is distant above 12.
leagues. Nor were we in less danger now than before, for as much as the Boats, being small
and old, were not caulked, and were ty'd above, only with cords made of barks of trees. The
sail was a great many rags fasten'd together, and so order'd, that there was no use to be made
of it but when the wind blew right a-stern: so that the wind beginning to shift, after we had
come five leagues, the Fisher-men would have tack'd about, but we prevail'd with them to let
down the sail, and to make use of their Oars, to get to an Island which was within half a league
of us, and where we arriv'd that night. We found there only two ruin'd hutts; we made a fire,

and pass'd over the night, but having neither Bread nor Meat, we made our supper on a piece
of Milan Cheese we had left.
                  The next day, we prosecuted our Voyage with a very good wind and fair weather, though the
Sea was a little rough. Having made two leagues, a sudden blast coming from the East, though
the wind were North turn'd the Boat, in which I was, with the Ambassador Brugman, so
much upon one side, that it took in water; the surges at the same time rising half an ell above
the brinck of it. All the Fisher-men could do was to let down the sail, and to run to the other
side of the boat to weigh it down. The blast being over, we kept on our course, till a second
put us to the same trouble. We had three of them in less than two hours; and this I think the
greatest danger we had met with, in our Voyage: in as much as the Boat being old, and having
in it, eight Persons, all the Silver Plate and other luggage, which in a manner fill'd it, so
as that one wave might have overwhelm'd it, and cast us all away. But afterwards, when the
Fisher-men saw the blast coming, they turn'd the side of the Boat to the wind, that the wave
might not come with its full force upon it, and by that means we avoided the danger. Within
three Leagues of Land we had also a violent shower of hail; but what is most to be admir'd in
all this, was, that the Boat which carried the Ambassador Crusius, though within Pistol-shot of
us, felt nothing of all this, but had fair weather all along.
                  Being gotten within half a League of Land, the wind, shifting to the South, was just in our
teeth, and had oblig'd our Fisher-men to return, if the hope of a three-pint-Flagon of strong
water, which we promis'd them, had not given them the courage to let down the sail, and to
row us ashore.The Ambassadors come into Livonia. This was the 18. at night, in Esthonie, after we had roved two and twenty
dayes upon the Baltick Sea, with all the danger that is to be expected by those, who trust themselves
to the mercy of that Element in so uncertain a season.
                  The 22. came to Hogland two other barks forc'd thither by foul weather: Those we had left
of ours in the Island pass'd in them to the continent, whither they came the 24. with the horses
and baggage. We went thence to Kunda, a house belonging to my late Father-in-Law, Iohn
Muller, distant two Leagues from the Sea, where we staid three weeks, to refresh our selves
after so much hardship at Sea. Most of us fell sick, yet none kept their beds above three dayes.
Thence we went to Reuel,To Reuel. DECEM. whether we came the second of December, with an intention to sojourn
there some time, which we spent in ordering our Cloaths, and the Presents, which the
salt-water, and the other inconveniences ensuing upon the wrack, had much prejudiced.
                  The Ambassadors having all their people about them at Reuel, thought fit to publish the Order
which the Duke would have observ'd through the whole Voyage. They had brought it
with them seal'd with his Highnesse's Great Seal: but they added some things thereto, the better
to prevent the disorders, which are but too frequent where there are so many Servants. But in
regard they contain'd nothing extraordinary, we shall not insert them here, and only say, they
were ill observ'd: for the Ambassador Brugman having arm'd the Lacquies with Pole-axes,
which had Pistols in their handles, and given order they should not take any affront from the
Inhabitants of Reuel, there hardly pass'd a day during the three Moneths we staid there, in expectation
of other Credentials, but there was some falling out and fighting. In so much that
Feb. 11. Isaac Mercier, a French-man, that waited on the Ambassador Brugman in his Chamber,
a person of a good humour and not quarrellous, hearing the noise of an engagement between
the Ambassadors Servants and the Apprentices of the City, and desirous to relieve his
friends, was struck over the head with an iron-bar, which bruis'd the skull so, as that he dyed
the next day. The Magistrate did all lay in his power to find out the Murtherer; but, to no
purpose, so that all the reparation was, that the Senate, together with the Ambassadors and
their retinue, accompany'd him to the grave.
                  ReuelReuel described. is situated at 50. degr. 25. min. latitude, and 48. deg. 30. min. longitude, upon the
Baltick Sea, in the Province of Esthonie. Waldemar, or Wolmar II. King of Denmark, laid the
foundations of it, about the year 1230. Wolmar III. sold it in the year 1347. together with the
Cities of Narvan and Wesenberg to Gosuin d'Eck, Master of the Order of Livonia, for 19000.
Marks of Silver. About 100. years since, Livonia groaning under a troublesome War against
Muscovy, this City put it self under the protection of Eric, King of Sueden. It was so strong
in those times, that it indur'd a notable Siege in the year 1570. against Magnus, Duke of Holstein,
who commanded the Great Duke's Army; and another in the year 1577. against the same
Muscovites, who were forc'd to raise it with loss. The situation of its Castle is so much the
more advantageous, for that the Rock on which it is built is steepy on all sides, unless it be towards
the City, which, being fortify'd according to the modern fortification, is almost as considerable
a place as Riga; whence it came that for some years, it had the oversight of the College
at Novogorod, joyntly with the City of Lubeck. It hath been these 300. years numbred
among the Hanseatick Towns; but its Commerce began not to be great till about the year
1477. and at that time it might well keep up its Traffick, especially that of Muscovy, by reason
of her excellent Port and Haven, which indeed are such, as if God and Nature had intended
it for the convenience of Commerce. Had it not been ingross'd into few hands, it had still continu'd

in the same posture; but having broken with the other Hanseatick Towns in the year
1550. and the Great Duke having taken Narva soon after, the Muscovites establish'd, there, the
Trading they before had at Reuel. It still enjoyes the privilege of being a Mart, and the Inhabitants
have, with the preference of the Merchandises discharg'd in their Port, the power to hinder
the Traffick of Livonia into Muscovy, without their permission. These privileges have been
confirmed to it by all the Treaties that have been made between the Kings of Suoden, and Dukes
of Muscovy, as in the year 1595. at Teusina, in 1607. at Wibourg, and in 1617. at Stoluos.
'Tis true it hath lost some of these advantages since the last War of Muscovy, which were taken
away, left, in imitation of several other of the Hanseatick Towns, it should attempt a defection
from its Prince, yet does it still enjoy many other privileges, which have been confirmed to it,
from time to time, by the Masters of the Order, while they were Lords of the Country, and
afterwards by the Kings their Successors. It observes the same Customes with Lubeck, and
hath a Consistory and a Superintendent for Ecclesiastical affairs, professing the Protestant Religion,
according to the Auspourg Confession, as also a very fair School, whence there come very
good Scholars, who consummate their studies at Derpt, or some other Universities in those
quarters. The Government of the City is Democratical, the Magistrate being oblig'd to summon
the principal of several Professions, and the most antient Inhabitants, to consultations that
concern affairs of Importance. There are still to be seen, within half a League of the City,
towards the Sea-side, the ruins of a fair Monastery, founded by a Merchant of that City, at
the beginning of the 15th age, out of a particular devotion he had for St. Bridget, under Conrad
de Iungingen, Grand Master of Prussia, and Conrad de Vitinghof, Master Provincial of Livonia.
It consisted of both Religious Men and Women, and the Book I saw of the foundation of this
Monastery, pleasantly acquaints the Reader, that the Friers and Nuns there had found out
a way to express their meanings one to another by signs, of which there is in it a little
Dictionary.
                  Livonia hath,The description of Livonia. on the East, Muscovy; on the North, a Gulf of the Baltick Sea, dividing it
from Sueden and Finland; on the West, the same Baltick Sea, and on the South, Samogitia,
Lithuania, and Prussia. It is above 120. German leagues in length, and about 40. in breadth,
and is divided into Esthonie, Lettie, and Courland. The first of these Provinces is subdivided into
five Circuits, called Harrie, Wirland, Allentaken, Ierwe, and Wiecks, its chief City Reuel,
as Lettie hath Riga, and Courland, Goldingen.
                  Livonia, and its Lords, the Masters of the Order, of whom we shall speak hereafter, were
subject to the Emperor of Germany, not only since the Conquest of that Island from the Infidels
by the Germans, but also, particularly since that in the year 1513. the Archbishop of
Riga, with his Suffragans, and the Master of the Order, who had freed himself
from the subjection of that, of Prussia, were receiv'd among the Princes of the
Empire. Let us now see how it is gone from the Empire. The Muscovite looking
on this Province as lying very convenient for him, enter'd it, in the year 1501. with
a powerful Army; but Gualtier de Plettenberg, Master of the Order, gave him battel, wherein
above 40000 Muscovites were kill'd upon the place. This defeat produc'd a Cessation of
50 years. In the year 1558. Iohn Basilouits, Great Duke of Muscovy, having added to his
territories the Tartars of Cassan and Astrachan, and willing to make his advantages of the differences
between the Master of the Order, and Archbishop of Riga, enter'd Livonia, and having
made incursions into the Bishoprick of Derpt, and Wirland, retreated into Muscovy. During
these troubles, the Livonians were importunate with the Estates of the Empire, to send them
relief against so cruel and barbarous an enemy; but none being to be expected, the City of
Reuel, which was the most expos'd to danger, offer'd it self to the King of Denmark, and upon
his refusal, apply'd it self to Eric King of Sueden, and desir'd of him a considerable succour
of men and money. His answer was, that his Kingdom was not in a condition to supply them
with either, but if the Town would put it self under his protection, he would maintain all its
Privileges, and defend it against the Muscovite. Upon which, the City, having advis'd with
the adjacent Nobility, broke off from the Master of the Order, and put it self under the protection
of the King of Sueden, in the year 1560. The year before, 1559. the Archbishop of
Riga, and the Coadjutor of the Order, had made their addresses to Sigisund Augustus, King
of Poland, for assistance against the same enemy, and had promised him the sum of 600000.
Ducats towards the charges of the War, engaging to him, for his security, nine of the best
Baylywicks of the Country. But in the year 1561. the King of Poland, perceiving that all Livonia
was likely to be lost, through the divisions of the Province, and that the City of Reuel,
with part of Esthonie, had submitted to the King of Sueden, refus'd to execute the Treaty, and
to send the relief promised, unless the Archbishop, and Master of the Order, would acknowledge
the Soveraignty of the King of Poland. This extremity forc'd them to put all the Acts
and Privileges they had obtain'd from the Empire and Pope, with the Seal, and other marks of
Soveraignty, into the hands of the Prince of Radzivil, Commissioner from Poland, to whom
also they took the Oath of fidelity. Upon which the King of Poland gave Courland, with the

                     
                     

                     
                     
title of a Dutchy, to Godard Ketler, Master of the Order, who took the Oath of Allegiance
to the Crown of Poland, on the 5 of March 1562.
                  By the Treaty concluded between the King of Poland, and the Great Duke of Muscovy, Jan.
15. 1582. the Duke restor'd to the Crown of Poland all the places of Livonia, those excepted
which the King of Sueden was possess'd of in Esthony. Now, it is in a manner all under the
power of the Suede.
                  Livonia is,Its fertility in all parts, very fertile, and particularly in Wheat. For though it hath suffered
much by the Muscovites, yet it is now more and more reduc'd to tillage, by setting the
Forests afire, and sowing in the ashes of the burnt Wood and Turf, which for three or four
years produce excellent good Wheat, and with great increase, without any Dung. Which is
the more to be admir'd, in that 'tis known there remains to generative quality in the ashes: So
that it is to be conceiv'd, that the Sulphur and Saltpeter, which remain with the Cinders upon
the earth, leave behind them a heat and fatness able to produce, as well as dung. Which conceit
is not disonant from what Strabo says, at the end of his fifth book, where he speaks of the
fertility of the Lands near the Mountain Vesuvius and Mont-gibel, in Sicily. There is also abundance
of Cattel, and Fowl, so cheap, that many times we bought a young Hare for four
pence; a Heath-Cock for fix, and accordingly others, so that it is much cheaper living there
than in Germany.
                  The Inhabitants were a long time Heathens,Its Inhabitants. it being in the 12 age that the rayes of the Sun
of righteousness began to break in upon them, occasion'd by the frequentation of certain Merchants
of Bremen, and the Commerce they were desirous to establish in those parts. About the
year 1158. one of their Ships having been forc'd by a Tempest into the Gulf of Riga, which was
not yet known, the Merchants agreed so well with the Inhabitants of the Country, that they
resolv'd to continue their Traffick there, having withall, this satisfaction, that, the people being
very simple, they thought it would be no hard matter to reduce them to Christianity. Menard,
a Monk of Segeberg, was the first that preach'd the Gospel to them, and was made first Bishop
of Livonia, by Pope Alexander III. in the year 1170. Menard was succeeded in the Bishoprick
of Livonia, by Bertold, a Monk, of the Order of white Friers; but he, thinking to
reduce those people rather by Arms than the word of God, met with a success accordingly, for
having incens'd them, they kill'd him in the year 1186. and with him 11000. Christians. Albert,
a Canon of Bremen,The Orders of Livonian Knights. succeeded Bertold, in the Bishoprick. He laid the first foundations of
the City of Riga, and of the Order of the Friers of the short sword, by authority from Pope Innocent
the third, and by vertue of a power he had given them, to allow them the third part of
that they should Conquer from the Barbarians. They observ'd the same rule as the Templars,
and were call'd Friers or Knights of the short sword, because they had on their white Cloaks a
red short sword, with a star of the same colour, which they have chang'd since into two short
Swords, Saltar-wise. But in regard this new Religious Profession was not fully setled, it was
joyn'd to the Order of St. Mary of Ierusalem, in the person of Herman Balk, Grand-Master of
Prussia, in the year 1238. And it is since that time that the Master Livonia had a dependence
on the Grand-Master of Prussia, which was, till Sigismond King of Poland chang'd that quality
into that of Duke of Courland, in the person of Godard Ketler, as is said before.
                  All the Champain Countrey, of the two Provinces of Letthie and Esthonie, is to this day
peopled with these Barbarians, who have nothing of their own, but are slaves, and serve the
Nobility in the Countrey, and the Citizens in Cities. They are called Unteutche, that is, not-Germans,
because their language was not understood by the Germans, who went to plant in
those quarters; though that of Letthie hath nothing common with that of Esthonie, no more
than there is between them, as their Cloaths and manner of Life. The Women of Esthonie
wear their Petticoats very narrow, and without any folds, like sacks, adorn'd above on their
backs with many little brass Chains, having at the ends Counters of the same metal, and below
set out with a certain lacing of yellow glass. Those who would express a greater bravery,
have about their Necks a Necklace of plates of silver of the bigness of a Crown, or half-Crown,
and upon the breast, one as big as a round Trencher, but not much thicker than the back of a
knife.
                  Maids wear nought on their heads, Summer nor Winter, and cut their hair as the men do,
letting it fall negligently down about the head. Both Men and Women are clad with a wretched
stuff made of Wool, or a coarse Linnen. They are yet unacquainted with Tannage, so that,
in Summer, they have barks of Trees about their feet, and in the Winter, raw Leather of a
Cow's hide. Both Men and Women do ordinarily carry all the Wealth they have about them.
                  Their Ceremonies of marriage are very odd.The Ceremonies of marriages in Livonia. When a Country fellow marries a Lass out of
another Village, he goes a hors-back to fetch her, sets her behind him, and makes her embrace
him with the right hand. He hath in his hand a stick cleft at the top, where he puts a piece of brass
money, which he gives to him who opens the wicket, through which he is to pass. Before, rides
a man that playes upon the Bag-pipe, as also two of his friends, who, having naked swords in
their hands, give two stroaks therewith, cross the Door of the House, where the marriage is to

be consummated, and then they thrust the point of one of the swords into a beam, over the
Bridegroom's head, which is done to prevent Charms, which, they say, are ordinary in that
Country. 'Tis to the same end that the Bride scatters little pieces of Cloath, or red Serge by the
way, especially where cross-ways meet, near Crosses, and upon the Graves of little Children
dead without baptism, whom they bury in the High-ways. She hath a Veil over her face while
she is at the Table, which is not long; for, as soon almost as the Guests are set down, the
married couple rise, and go to bed. About two hours after they get up, and are brought to
sit down at the Table. Having drunk and danc'd till such time as they are able to stand no longer,
they fall down on the floor, and sleep altogether like so many Swine.
                  We said the Gospel was pteach'd in Livonia in the 12. age;They are sad Christians. but the Livonians are never the
better Christians for it. Most of them are only such in name, and can hardly yet abstain from
their Heathenish Superstitions. For though they are Lutherans, by profession, and that there
is hardly a Village but hath its Church and Minister; yet are they so poorly instructed, and so
far from regeneration, that it may be said, Baptism excepted, they have not any Character of
Christianity. They very seldom go to Sermons, and never almost Communicate. They excuse
their backwardness in frequenting the Sacraments, by alleging the great slavery they are in,
which, they say, is so insupportable, that they have not time to mind their Devotions. If they
go at any time to Sermon, or to the Communion, it is by force, or upon some other particular
accompt. To this effect is a story was told me by Andrew Besiq, Provost of the Church
of Luckenhausen, which was, That having been sent for to comfort, and administer the Communion
to a Country-fellow who lay very sick, he ask'd him how he came to send for his Pastor
in the condition he was then in, when for so many years before he had never bethought
him of reconciling himself to God? The fellow ingenuously answer'd, that, for his own part,
he should not have minded it then, but what he did, was by the advice of a friend, who told
him, that if he did it not, he could not be buried in the Church-yard, nor carried to the
ground with the ordinary Ceremonies. 'Tis true, the gross and inexcusable ignorance of most
of the Pastors in those quarters, who might well come to be Catechiz'd themselves, hath contributed
much to the obduration of those poor people: but the late King of Sueden hath taken
order, therein enjoyning, by a severe Ordinance, the Bishop of the Province, who hath
his residence in the Cathedral Church of Reuel, to convocate a Synod once a year, for the regulation
of Church affairs, and then to examine, not only the Recipiendaries, but also the
Pastors themselves, thereby to oblige them to apply themselves to the constant study of the holy
Scripture.
                  It must be acknowledg'd,Their slavery. the slavery these people are in is great, and indeed insupportable;
but it is true withall; that upon the least liberty given them, they would break out into any
extravagance. For being perswaded that their Predecessors have been Masters of the Country,
and that only force hath enslav'd them to the Germans, they cannot forbear their resentments of
it, and discovering, especially in their drink, if any opportunity of regaining their liberty
should offer it self, a readiness to prosecute it. Of which they gave an evident example, when,
upon the irruption of Colonel Bot, the Peasants would side with the Enemy, and head
together, to secure their Masters and deliver them up to the Polanders.
                  They believe there is another life after this;Their opinion of eternal life. but their imaginations of it are very extravagant.
A Livonian woman, being present at her husband's burial, put a Needle and Thread into the
Grave, giving this reason for it, that, her husband being to meet, in the other World, with
persons of good Rank, she was asham'd he should be seen with his Cloaths rent. Nay, they so
little mind what is to happen in the next World, that in the Oath they take to decide any difference
at Law, instead of interessing the salvation of their Souls therein, they are oblig'd to
consider their present and temporal advantages, and so they are sworn, as followeth: I, N. N.
am here present before thee: since thou, O Iudge, desirest to know, and askest me, whether this
Land, on which I now am, is God's and mine with a just title, I swear to God and his Saints,
and accordingly God judge me at the last day, that this Land belongs to me of right, that it is
God's and mine, and that my father hath been possess'd of it, and hath enjoy'd it a long time. And
if the Oath I take prove to be false, I consent, that the Curse of God fall upon my Body and Soul,
upon my Children, upon whatsoever appertains to me, even to the ninth generation. And to shew
that their Language hath nothing common with any of those, wherewith the most learned
have any acquaintance, we shall here set down the same Oath, word for word, as
they take it.

'Tis the same in Esthonie; but about Riga, when the Peasants swear at Law, they put a Turf
upon their heads, and take a white stick in their hands, expressing thereby, that they are content,
that they, their Children, and Cattel, may become dry as that Turf, and that stick, if they
swear falsly.
                  These customs favour of their antient Idolatry. The Ministers do all they can to weed it out
of them by little and little: to which end we saw, at Narva, the Catechism, Epistles, and
Gospels, with their explications, which Henry Stahl, Superintendent of Ecclesiastical affairs
in those parts (a person much esteem'd for his Learning and pains in instructing those Barbarians)
had caused to be translated and Printed in their Language, to give them some apprehensions
of Christian Religion. But Idolatry and Superstiton are too deeply rooted in them, and
their stupidity and stubborness too great to give way to any hope, that they will ever be susceptible
of instruction. They do their devotions commonly upon hills, or neer a tree they make
choice of to that purpose, and in which they make several incisions, bind them up with some red
stuff, and there say their prayers, wherein they desire only temporal blessings. Two leagues
from Kunda, between Reuel and Narva, there is an old ruin'd Chapel, whither the Peasants go
once a year on Pilgrimage, upon the day of our Lady's Visitation. Some put off their cloaths,
and in that posture having kneel'd by a great stone that is in the midst of the Chapel, they afterwards
leap about it, and offer it Fruits and Flesh, recommending the preservation of themselves
and their Cattel to it for that year. This piece of devotions is concluded with eating and drinking,
and all kind of licentiousness, which seldom end without quarrels, murthers, and the like
disorders.
                  They have such an inclination to Sorcery,Their Sorcery. and think it so necessary for the preservation of
their Cattel, that Fathers and Mothers teach it their Children, so that there is scarce any Peasant
but is a Sorcerer. They all observe certain superstitious Ceremonies, by which they think
to elude the effects of it, upon which accompt it is, that they never kill any Beast, but they cast
somewhat of it away, nor never make a Brewing, but they spill some part of it, that the Sorcery
may fall upon that. They have also a custome of rebaptizing their Children, when, during
the first six weeks after their birth, they chance to be sick or troubled with fits, whereof they
think the cause to be, that the name, given them at their baptism, is not proper for them. Wherefore
they give them another; but in regard this is not only a sin, but a crime which the Magistate
severely punishes in that Country, they conceal it.
                  As they are stubborn in their superstitions,Their obstinacy. so are they no less in the exact observation of
their Customs. To which purpose we had a very pleasant, but true, story, related to us at Colonel
de la Barr's, concerning an old Country fellow. Being condemn'd, for faults enormous
enough, to lye along upon the ground, to receive his punishment, and Madam de la Barre, pittying
his almost decrepit age, having so far interceded for him, as that his corporal punishment should
be chang'd into a pecuniary mulct of about 15. or 16. pence, he thank'd her for her kindness,
and said, that, for his part, being an old men, he would not introduce any novelty, nor suffer
the Customes of the Country to be alter'd, but was ready to receive the chastisement which his
Predecessors had not thought much to undergo, put off his cloaths, layd himself upon the ground,
and receiv'd the blows according to his condemnation.
                  This is accounted no punishment, but an ordinary chastisement in Livoniae For, the people,
being of an incorrigible nature, must be treated with that severity, which would elsewhere be
insupportable. They are not permitted to make any purchase, and to prevent their so doing,
they have only so much ground to manage, as will afford them a subsistence. Yet will they venture
to cut down wood in some places of the Forests, and, having order'd the ground, sow
wheat in it, which they hide in pits under ground, to be secretly sold. When they are taken
in this, or any other fault, they make them strip themselves naked down to the hips, and to
lye down upon the ground, or are ty'd to a post, while one of their Camerades beats them with
a Switch, or Hollywand, till the blood comes of all sides; especially when the Master says
Selcke nack maha pexema, Beat him till the skin falls from the flesh.
                  Nor are they suffer'd to have any money; for as soon as it is known they have any, the Gentlemen
and their Officers, who are paid by the Peasantry, take it from them, nay force them to
give what they have not. Which cruelty of the Masters puts these poor people many times into
despair, whereof there happened a sad example. A Peasant press'd by his Officer to pay what
he neither had, nor ought, and being depriv'd of the means whereby he should maintain his Family,
strangled his Wife and Children, and when he had done hung himself up by them. The
Officer coming the next day to the house, thinking to receive the mony, struck his head against
the man's feet that was hanging, and so perceiv'd the miserable execution, whereof he was the
cause.
                  The Nobility of Livonia,The Nobility of Livonia. especially of Esthonie, is free from all charges and taxes. Their
courage, and the services they have done against the Infidels and Muscovites, have acquir'd them
this liberty, and most of their privileges. Volmar II. King of Denmark, first gave them Mannors
to be held by Fealty, which have been since confirm'd by Eric VII. who gave them Letters

Patents to that purpose. The Masters of the Order of the Short Sword, and the Grand Masters
of the Order of Prussia, augmented them. Conrad de Iungingen extended the succession of such
Mannors, in Harrie and Wirland, to the daughters and their issue, to the fifth degree: and
Gaultier de Plettenberg, who was chosen Grand-Master, in the year 1495. and acknowledg'd
Prince of the Empire in 1513. absolutely exempted the Nobility of Esthonie from all subjection;
excepting only the service which Gentlemen are oblig'd to do in person, upon the accompt of
their Mannors. Once a year there is a review made of them, and that body of Nobility is look'd
upon as a Nursery, that hath furnish'd and still doth furnish Sueden with a great number of
Officers, even to Generals of Armies; besides the Noble Cavalry it is able to raise, for the
service of that Crown. The said Nobility came not under the protection of the King of
Sueden, till such time as, being forsaken by all their Neighbours, and not able to oppose
their enemies any longer, they were forc'd to make their applications to a forein
Crown, which hath promis'd to secure unto them all the Privileges, they have by their courage
acquired.
                  The Government of the Country,The Government of Livonia both as to Policy and Justice, is in the Nobility, who
commit the administration thereof to twelve of themselves, who are the Council of the Country,
and have for their President, him who is Governour of the Province for the Crown of
Sueden. In the time of our Embassy Philip Scheiding was President, who hath been since succeeded
by Eric Oxienstern, Baron of Kimilko, Counsellor of the Crown of Sueden, and he,

                  They meet yearly, in Ianuary, and then decide all differences between parties, all their
proceedings consisting in a Declaration and an Answer, upon which they immediately give
judgement. To this purpose is chosen a Gentleman, who hath the quality of Captain of the
Province, and represents to the Governour and Council the grievances of the people, if there
be any, and this employment is not continued in the same person above three years. And
whereas, during the Wars with the Muscovites and Polanders, private mens Inheritances in
the Provinces of Harrie, Wirland, and Wieck, have been so confounded, that the sutes occasion'd
thereby could not be peremptorily decided; there are appointed certain Judges from three
years to three years, who take cognizance thereof, and if any one find himself aggriev'd by
their judgement, he may appeal to the Governour and Council of the Country, who appoint
Commissioners, who having been upon the places in question, do either reverse or confirm the
former Judgement. They have also particular Judges for the High-wayes, which are there very
bad, because of the Fenns, Bridges, and Causwayes, which are frequent all over the
Country.
               
               
                  To return to our Voyage.The contnuation of our Voyage We said before, that the Ambassadors, coming to Calmer, in
the beginning of Novembor, had sent a Page and a Lacquey to Gottorp, for other Credentials,
instead of those the Sea-water had spoil'd. Iohn Arpenbeck our Interpreter, had been sent to
Musco, to give an account there of our delay, as also of the particulars of our wrack. Being
all return'd to Reuel,FEBRU. we prepar'd for the prosecution of our Voyage, and the 24 of Febr. the
Ambassador sent away the Controller of their house with 31 sledges, with part of the train and
baggage.MARCH The Ambassadors leave Reuel. Kunda. Come to Narva. We all went along with the rest. March 2. the Magistrate and some of our friends
brought us a league out of the City. We lay that night at Kolka, a house belonging to the
Count de la Garde, Constable of Sueden, 7 leagues from Reuel. March 3. we came to Kunda,
whereof we have spoken elsewhere; and the 4. to a house belonging to M. Iohn Fock, 5 leagues
from that of the Count de la Garde's.
                  March 5. after five leagues travelling, we came to Narva. 'Tis a small Town, but strong,
and hath a very good Castle. It is situated at 60 degrees of the Aequinoctial, in the Province of
Allentaken, so called from the River Narva or Nerva. This River rises out of the Lake Peipis,
and falls into the Gulf of Finland, two leagues below this Town. It is in a manner as broad as
the Elbe, but much swifter, and its water is very brownish. About half a league above this
Town, there is a fall of water, which makes a dreadful noise, and is so violent, that breaking
upon the Rocks, it is reduc'd as it were to powder, which filling the Air affords a strange
sight, by reason that the Sun shining upon it, makes a kind of Rain-bow, no less pleasant than
that fram'd in the Clouds. This fall occasions the unlading of all Merchandizes which pass that
way from Plescon and Derpt for Narva, to be sent into the Gulf of Finland. 'Tis said that Volmar
II. K. of Denmark, built it in the year 1213. Iohn Basilouits, G. D. of Muscovy, took it in the
year 1558. and Pontus de la Garde, General of the Suedish Army, recover'd it from the Muscovites,
on the 6 of September 1581. and ever since the Suedes have been masters of it. Nielis
Asserson was Governour of it, at the time of our Embassy, who was succeeded since by Eric
Gyllenstierna Governour and Lieutenant General for the Crown of Sueden, in Ingermania. It
hath a long time enjoy'd the same privileges with the other Hanseatick Towns: but the Wars
between Muscovy and Sueden had so far destroy'd the commerce of it, that it is within these
few years that there are some hopes conceived of its re-establishment, which cannot encrease
but as that of Reuel abates. The War between the English and Hollanders was so much to its

advantage,1636. that the Commerce of Archangel being by that means interrupted, the Ships that
were wont to go to Muscovy made use of the Haven of Narva, whither there came in the year
1654. above sixty Ships, and took up, there, Merchandizes amounting to above 500000
Crowns. Upon this they took occasion to cleanse and augment the Town, to build new and
regular streets for the convenience of strange Merchants, and to facilitate the passage of Ships
into the Haven. Queen Christina of Sueden, exempted this City out of the general Jurisdiction
of the Governour of the Province, and gave it a particular Lieutenant, to judge of affairs Secular
and Ecclesiastical, without appeal to any other place.
                  The Castle is on this side the River, and on the other,Juanogorod. that of Iuanogorod, which the Muscovites
have built upon a very steepy Rock, whereof the River of Narva makes a peninsula, so
that the place was judg'd impregnable, till Gustavus Adolphus took it, in the year 1617. At
the foot of this Castle is a Town called Narva Muscovite, to distinguish it from the Teutonick
or German Narva, whereof our discourse hath been. This Town is inhabited by natural
Muscovites, but Subjects of the Crown of Sueden, to which the said Gustavus hath also joyned
the Castle of Iuanogorod, where Nichola Gallen govern'd, at our passage that way, in quality
of the King's Lieutenant.
                  The Country between Reuel and Narva, as also generally all Ingermania and Livonia, have
in the Woods, a great number of Beasts that are yellowish and black; and among others such
abundance of Wolves and Bears, that the Peasants have much ado to keep them off their Cattel
and themselves. In Winter, when the ground is covered with snow, the Wolves, not
meeting with ought abroad, will come, in the day time, into mens yards, and carry away
the Doggs that keep them, and will break through the VValls, to get into the
Stables.
                  We were told,A remarkable story of a Wolf. that in the year 1634. upon the 24. of Ianuary, a Wolf, not of the biggest,
had set upon 12. Muscovian Peasants, who were bringing Hay to the City. He took the first
by the throat, got him down, and kill'd him; he did the like to the second. He flead the third's
head; eat off the nose and cheeks of a fourth, and hurt two more. The other six got together,
put themselves into a posture of defence, struck down the Wolf, and kill'd him. It was afterwards
discovered, that he was mad, for all those he had hurt dyed so. The Magistrate of Narva
had caus'd the skin to be preserv'd, which was shew'd as a thing very remarkable.
                  We were told also that a Bear, finding a Vessel of Herrings, which a Peasant had laid down
at an Alehouse door, fell a-eating of them, and went thence into the Stable, whither the
Peasants follow'd him; but having wounded some of them, the rest were glad to get away.
Thence he went into a Brewhouse, where meeting with a fat of new Beer, he got so drunk,
that the Peasants perceiving he reel'd every step, and at last fell asleep in the High-way, pursu'd
and kill'd him. Another Peasant having turn'd out his Horse a-grazing in the night, found
him next morning dead, with a Bear lying by him, who had fed very heartily upon him. But as
soon as the Bear perceiv'd the Peasant, he leaves the Prey he was already assur'd of, got hold
of the Peasant, and was carrying him away between his paws to his Den; but the Peasants
Dog having got the Bear by the foot, made him let go, and, while they were engag'd, the
Master had time to get up a Tree and save himself.
                  In the year 1634. A Bear digg'd up thirteen Carcasses out of a Church-yard, belonging to a
little Village near Narva, and carried them away with the Coffins. Not is it long since that a
Lady of quality in those parts met one carrying away a Carcass, with the shrowd trailing after
it, which frighted the Horse that drew the Lady's Sledge, so as that he ran away with her,
cross the fields, to the great hazard of her life. Many other stories were told us; as that of a
Bear who had kept a Woman 15 days together in his Den, and the manner how she was deliver'd
thence; but we shall forbear any further accompt of them, as relating more to natural History
than Travels. I shall only add, that the Peasants, who are not secure from these Creatures
when they goe but into the fields, especially in the night time, are of opinion, that the
noise of a stick, they fasten to the Sledges, frights the VVolves, and makes them run
away.
                  March 7. We left Narva,The Ambassadors leave Narva and lodg'd at night at Lilicnhagen,Lilicnhagen. seven leagues from it. The
8. we travel'd six leagues, to Sarits.Sarits. The 9. before noon, we got four leagues to Orlin,Orlin. where
the Interpreter we had sent before, to give notice of our departure from Reuel, met us, with
this news, that a Pristaf waited for us upon the Frontiers. And whereas many disorders were
crept into our retinue, insomuch that some express'd but little respect to their Superiours, the
Ambassadors caus'd all to come before them, and told them, that being upon their entrance
into Muscovy, where they judge of the quality of the Embassy, and the greatness of the Prince
that sends it, by the honour which the Ambassadors receives from those that are about them,
they should be mindful of their duty.
                  We all promis'd not to fail therein, provided we were mildly treated, every man according
to his place and quality. Which the Ambassadors having promised for their parts, we parted
cheerfully, to go and meet the Pristaf. We found him in a Wood within a league of Orlin,

where he stay'd for us, in the Snow, with twenty four Strelits about him, and ninety
Sledges.
                  As soon as the Pristaf, whose name was Constantino Iuanouits Arbusou, had perceiv'd us,
and saw that the Ambassadors were a lighting, he also came out of his Sledge. He was clad in a
Garment of green flower'd Velvet, which came down to his Hams, with a great Golden Chain
crossing over his breast, and an upper Garment lined with Sables. As the Ambassadors advanced,
he also came forward, till that being come up to them, and the Ambassadors having put off
their hats, the Pristaf said, Ambassadors, be uncover'd. The Ambassadors return'd him answer
by the Interpreter, that he saw, they were uncover'd, whereupon the Pristaf read out of a
Paper, That Knez Peter Alexandrowits Repuin, Weywode of Novogorod, had sent him, by
order from the Grand Seigneur, Czaar, and Great Duke Michael Federouits, Conservator of
all the Russes, &c. to receive the Ambassadors Philip Crusius, and Otton Brugman, and to
accommodate them with Horses, Carriages, Provisions, and what else were necessary for the
continuance of their Voyage to Novogorod, and thence to Moscon. After we had return'd
him our thanks, he gave us the precedence, enquir'd how we did, and of the particulars of our
voyage, and causing the Horses to be put before the Sledges, he made us travel six leagues further
that day,Tzuerin. Desan. Mokriza. Come to Novogorod. to a Village named Tzuerin.
                  March 10. About noon, we came to Desan, and at night to Mokriza, a Village 8 leagues
from Tzuerin.
                  The 11. We came to Novogorod. At the entrance of the City, the Pristaf took precedence
of the Ambassadors, though they endeavour'd to hinder him. But as soon as we were lodg'd,
he desir'd the Interpreter to excuse the incivility he had been guilty of, and to satisfie, the Ambassadors,
that what he had done was by express order from the Weywode, who would have
done him some ill Office about the Great Duke if he had not obey'd him.
                  From Narva to Novogorod are counted 40 German leagues; thence to Plescou 36. and to
Moscou 120. leagues.A description of the City of Novogorod. Novogorod is situated upon the River Wolgda, at 58 degrees, 23 min.
elevation. Lundorp in his Continuation of Sleidan, puts it at 62. and Paulus Iovius, at 64
degrees: but at the exact observation I made of it on the 15 of March 1636. I found, that, at
noon, the Sun was above the Horizon 33 degr. 45 min. and that the declination of the Sun,
by reason of the Leap-year, because of 55. degr. was 2 degr. and 8 min. which being substracted
out of the elevation of the Sun, that of the Equinoctial line could be but 31 degr. 27 min.
which taken out of 90 degr. there remains but 58 degrees, 23 minutes. Which almost agrees
with the calculation made of it by Bureus, some time Ambassador for the Crown of Sueden in
Muscovy, who puts the City of Novogorod, at 58 degrees, 13 minutes. It is seated in a spacious
plain upon the River Wolgda, or Wolchou, which hath its rise out of the Lake of Ilmen, half a
league above this City, and crossing the Lake of Ladoga, does, in its way, pass through the
River Niova, near Notebourg, and by the Gulf of Finland, falls into the Baltick Sea. It abounds
with all sorts of fish, especially Breme, which are there excellent good, and very cheap.
But the greatest advantage accrews to this City from this River, is by Commerce. For being
Navigable from its very source, and the Country abounding in Wheat, Flax, Hemp, Honey,
Wax, and Russia Leather, which is better dress'd at Novogorod, than in any other City of
Muscovy, the easiness of the transportation of these Commodities, brought thither not only
the Livonians and Suedes, who are Neighbours, but also Danes, Germans, and Flemmings,
who setled themselves there so well, that it was, without dispute, the greatest City for Trade
in all the North. The Hanseatick Towns had an Office of Address in this City, which enjoying
many great Privileges under its Prince, who had no dependance on the Great Duke, was
grown so powerful, that it grew into a Proverb, Ochto Moschet stoiati protif Bocho dai welik
Novogorod? Who can oppose God and the great City of Novogorod?
                  Some would compare it, for greatness, with Rome; but they are mistaken. For though it be
called Weliki Novogorod, the great Novogorod, yet can it not be compar'd to Rome. It's not
unlikely, it hath been greater than it is now, not only because it was the greatest for Commerce
of any in the North, but also for that all about may be seen the ruins of Walls, and several
Steeples, which, no doubt, had been part of the City. The number of its Steeples promises
yet somewhat more great and noble, than what may be now seen; since that coming to
the City, we see onely VValls of VVood, and Houses built with Beams lay'd one upon another.
                  Vithold, Great Duke of Lithuania, and General of the Polish Army, was the first that, in
the year 1427. oblig'd it to pay a considerable Tribute, which some would have amount to
100000 Roubles, which come to above 200000 Crowns. The Tyrant Iohn Basili Grotsdin,
having after a seven years War, gain'd a great victory over an Army rais'd by this City, in the
moneth of November 1477 forc'd the Inhabitants to submission, and to receive a Governour
from him: but considering withall that he could not make himself as absolute as he would be
there, and that it would be hard for him to settle himself there by force, he thought it best to
go thither in person, pretending some concernments of Religion, and that he would prevent

their embracing the Roman Catholick. The Archbishop Theophilus, who had most authority
there, was the most forward to promote his design, and the first rewarded for his pains. For
no sooner was the Tyrant got into the City, but he pillag'd it, so that, at his departure thence,
he carry'd away three hundred Wagons loaden with Gold, Silver, and Jewels, besides the rich
stuffs and other sumptuous moveables, which he dispos'd into other Wagons, and convey'd to
Moscou whither he also transported the Inhabitants, and sent Muscovites thither in their
stead. But nothing contributed more to the destruction of this Citie, than the bruitish cruelty
of Iohn Basilouits, Great Duke of Muscovy. This Tyrant, upon a meer suspition he had conceiv'd
of the Inhabitants of Novogorod, enter'd the City, in the year 1569. and caus'd to be
kill'd or cast into the River 2770. persons, without any respect of quality, age, or sex, besides
an Infinite number of poor people who were trampled to death by a party of horse. A Gentleman,
sent by the King of Denmark, to this Tyrant, eight years after the taking of the City,
relates in his Itinerary, that persons of quality had assur'd him, that there were so many bodies
cast into Wolgda, that the River stopping overflow'd all the neighbouring fields. The Plague
which soon follow'd this cruelty, was so great, that, no body venturing to bring in Provisions,
the Inhabitants fed on the dead Carcasses. The Tyrant took a pretence from this inhumanity
to cause to be cut in pieces all those who had escap'd the Plague, Famine, and his former
cruelty, which was no doubt more dreadful than all the other chastisements of God. I shall allege
onely two Examples relating to Novogorod.An example of cruelty. The Archbishop of this place, having escap'd
the first fury of the Soldiery, either as an acknowledgement of the favour, or to flatter the Tyrant
entertains him at a great Feast in his Archiepiscopal Place, whither the Duke fayl'd not
to come, with his Guard about him: but while they were at Dinner, he sent to pillage the rich
Temple of St. Sophia, and all the Treasures of the other Churches, which had been brought thither,
as to a place of safety. After Dinner he caus'd the Archbishops Palace to be in like manner pillaged,
and told the Archbishop, that it would be ridiculous for him to act the Prelate any longer,
since he had not to bear himself out in that quality; that he must put off his rich habit,
which must thence-forward be troublesome to him, and that he would bestow on him a Bagpipe
and a Bear, which he should lead up and down, and teach to dance, to get mony; That he must
resolve to marry, and that all the other Prelates and Abbots that were about the City should be
invited to the Wedding, setting down the precise sum which it was his pleasure that every one
should present to the new-married couple. None but brought what he had made a shift to save,
thinking the poor Archbishop would have had it. But the Tyrant took all the money, and,
having caus'd a white Mare to be brought, said to the Archbishop; There is thy wife, get up on
her, and go to Moscou, where I will have thee entertain'd among the Violins, that thou may'st
teach the Bear to dance. The Archbishop was forc'd to obey, and, as soon as he was mounted,
they ty'd his legs under the Mare's belly, hung about his neck some Pipes, Fidle, and a Timbrel,
and would needs make him play on the Pipes. He scap'd with this punishment, but all the
other Abbots and Monks were either cut to pieces, or, with Pikes and Halbards, forc'd into
the River.
                  Nay, he had a particular longing for the mony of one Theodore Sircon, a rich Merchant. He
sent for him to the Camp neer Novogorod, and, having fasten'd a rope about his waste, order'd
him to be cast into the River, drawing him from one side of it to the other, till he was ready to
give up the ghost. Then he caus'd him to be taken up, and ask'd him what he had seen under
water. The Merchant answer'd, That he had seen a great number of Devils thronging about
the Tyrant's soul, to carry it along with them to Hell. The Tyrant reply'd, Thou art in the
right on't: but it is just I should reward thee for thy prophecy, whereupon calling for seething
oil, he caused his feet to be put into it, and continu'd there, till he had promis'd to pay
him ten thousand Crowns. Which done, he caus'd him to be cut to pieces, with his brother
Alexis.
                  The Baron of Herberstein, who travel'd into Muscovy, in the time of the Emperor Maximilian
the first, and about his Affairs, says, that heretofore, before the City of Novogorod
was converted to the Christian Faith,Perun. there was an Idol called Perun, that is, the God of
Fire, perun, in the Muscovian language signifying fire. This God was represented with a
Thunder-bolt in his hand, and hard by him was kept a constant fire of Oak, which was not
to go out, but at the peril of their lives who kept it. The same Author addes, that the Inhabitants
of Novogorod having received Baptism, and being made Christians, cast the Idol into
water, that it went against the stream of the River, and that being near the Bridge, it call'd
to the Inhabitants, and casting a stick among them, bid them keep it for his sake; That in his
time, on a certain day in the year, the voice of Perun was heard there, and that thereupon
the Inhabitants fell a-fighting with sticks, so earnestly, that the Weywode had much ado to separate
them. But now there is no talk of any such thing, there being no monument of Perun
left, other than that there is a Monastery called Perumski Monastir, which they say is built
in the place where the Temple of the Idol stood before.
                  Without the City, and on the other side of the River, is a Castle, encompass'd with a stonewall,

where live the Weywode and the Metropolitan, or Arch-bishop, who hath the over-sight
of Ecclesiastical affairs all over the Province. This Castle joyns to the City by a great Bridge,
from which, Duke Iohn Basilouits caus'd a great number of Inhabitants to be cast into the River,
as was said before. Over against the Castle, on the same side with the City, is a Convent,
dedicated to St. Anthony.St. Anthony's Monastery. The Muscovites say, he came from Rome into those parts upon a
Mill-stone, upon which he came down the Tiber, cross'd the Sea, and so up the River Wolgda,
to Novogorod. They add, that, by the way, he met certain Fisher-men, with whom he
bargain'd for the first draught they should make: that they brought up a Chest full of Priests
Vestiments to say Mass in, Books, and Money, belonging to this Saint, and that afterwards
he built a Chapel there, in which they say he lies interr'd, and that his Body is there to be
seen, as entire as when he departed this World. Many Miracles are wrought there, as they
say; but they permit not strangers to go in, thinking it enough to shew them the Mill-stone,
upon which the Saint perform'd this pretended voyage, and which indeed may be seen lying against
the Wall. The Devotions performed there have been such as have built a very fair Monastery
in that place.
                  We staid at Novogorod, five days, during which the Weywode sent us a Present of 24 sorts of
meat, dress'd after their way, and 16 sorts of drink. The Chancellor, Bogdan Foederouits Oboburou,
who had been our Pristaf in the former Voyage, sent us also divers delicacies. The
Ambassadors presented the Weywode with a new Coach.The Ambassadors leave Novogorod.
                  
                  March 16. VVe had brought us 129 fresh Horses for our Sledges, and we got that day four
leagues to Brunits,Brunits. where we took up fresh Horses again, wherewith, the next day, we travel'd
in the forenoon 8 leagues to Miedna,Miedna. and in the afternoon, four and a half to Kressa.Kressa. The
18 we got before dinner six leagues to Iaselbitza;Iaselbitza. in the afternoon, four to Simnagora.Simnagora. The
19. nine leagues to Columna;Columna. and the 20. five, to Wisna wolloka,Wisna wolloka. where we saw a young man of
12 years of age that was married. At Tuere, we saw a married woman that was but 11. and
this is ordinary in Muscovy, as also in Finland. The same night we came to Windra Pusk,Windra Pusk.
having travel'd that afternoon seven leagues. In this last place, there were but three houses,
and the stoves so nasty and stinking, that we had a very ill night of it, though indeed in other
places the stoves are not kept much better than stables in our Country.
                  The 21 we got 7 leagues, to Torsock.Torsock. The 22. six, to Troitska Miedna;Troitza Miedna. and the 23. six
more, to Tuere,Tuere. mentioned before. Here the snow beginning to melt in several places, we
quitted our Sledges, and took the Wolgda, which was still frozen, and travel'd that day six
leagues, to Gorodna. The 24. we went by land again, for the Ice began to give way, and got
to Sawidoua;Sawidowa and thence to Saulkspas,Saulkspas. seven leagues from our last lodging, having, by the
way, pass'd several Brooks with great difficulty, by reason the Ice was loose. The 25. we
pass'd by a great Village called Klin,Klin. behind which is the Brook Sestrea, which falls into the
River Dubna, and, with it, into Wolgda. We were forc'd to stay the flakes of Ice with stakes,
which we made a shift to fasten in the Brook, to hinder them from carrying us away. The next
day we pass'd it again, by reason it winds it self up and down in those parts, and lodg'd that
night at Beschick,Beschick. seven leagues from Klin. The 27. we pass'd two other little Brooks, and
got 6 leagues forwards, to Zerkizouo.Zerkizouo The 28. we got but three leagues, to Nicola-Darebna,Nicola-Darebna.
which the Author, in the first Book calls Nicola Nachinski, within two leagues of Moscou,
where the Ambassadors are wont to expect the Great Duke's pleasure, and the order he would
have observ'd in their entrance. In the mean time we fitted our Liveries, and set our selves
in order for our Cavalcade, which we made the next day at Noon, as followeth.
                  First,Their entrance into Moscou. went the 24 Musketiers who had conducted us from the Frontiers, being all Cosaques.
After them our Mareschal alone.
                  Then the Officers and Gentlemen, three a-breast, and those of best quality first.
                  Three Trumpetters, with silver Trumpets.
                  Then the Ambassadors, each in his Sledge, having before them six with Carabins, and on
both sides as many, with Partizans.
                  Next the Sledges, came the Pages, and after them, the rest of the retinue on horse-back,
and the baggage, all in very good order. The Pristaf took place of the Ambassadors. Being
come within half a league of the City, there met us many Troops of horse, Muscovian, Tartars,
and some Germans, who having rid about our Cavalcade, return'd to the City. After these
came several other Troops, which divided themselves, and encompassing us on both sides, conducted
us to the City.
                  About a quarter of a league from the City we met two Pristafs, with a very noble attendance,
and the same equipage they had at our former reception. Being come within 20. paces of us,
they sent word to the Ambassadors, that they should alight out of their Sledges, and come to
them. The Pristafs neither alighted, nor uncover'd themselves, till the Ambassadors had done
both. They are enjoyn'd to proceed with this reservedness, and to stand very much upon the
grandeur and reputation of their Prince, upon pain of being cast out of favour, which disgrace
is many times attended with whipping or cudgeling.
                  
                     
Our reception was after the same manner as the first time, the more aged Pristaf beginning in
these termes;The reception of the Ambassadors. The Grand Seigneur, Czar, and Great Duke, Michael Federouits, &c. (repeating
all the other Titles) hath commanded us to receive thee, Philip Crusius, and thee Otton
Brugman, great Ambassador from the Grand Seignor, Frederick Duke of Holstein, and to conduct
you to his Capital City of Moscou. To which the other added; His Majesty hath appointed
these Tumoronins, or Gentlemen, here present, Iuan Iuaniosin Salmosin, and my self Andrew
Iuanouits Zabaro, to be your Pristafs during the abode you shall make there. Then the Master of
the Horse presented himself, made his complement, and brought the Ambassadors, two very
stately Horses, white as snow, and twelve others for the chief of their retinue. From the Gate
to our Lodgings, we pass'd through a double file of Musketiers, to the number of above 3000.
and we were lodg'd in that quarter of the City which is called Cataigorod, not far from the Castle,
in a stone-house, built by an Archbishop named Susinski, who fell into disgrace some years
before, and was banish'd.
                  As soon as we had alighted, there were brought in, from the Great Duke's Kitchin and Cellar,Their allowance???
all sorts of meats and drinks. And from that time during our stay at Moscou, we were allow'd,
every day, sixty two Loaves, a quarter of Beef, four Sheep, a dozen of Pullets, two
Geese, one Hare, and one Heath-cock, alternately, fifty Eggs, ten pence towards Candles, and
five pence for small things us'd in the Kitchin, one Pot of Sack, eight of Hydromel, three of
Beer, and three small pots of Strong-water. Besides all this, for a common stock, a Tun of
Beer, a lesser Tun of Hydromel, and a Barrel of Strong-water. With this we had, by way of
extraordinary in the week, a poude, that is, forty pound of Butter, and as much Salt, three
Pails of Vinigre, two Muttons, and a Goose. This allowance was doubled at our arrival, as also
upon Palm-Sunday, Easter-day, and the young Prince's Birth-day; but we had them dress'd by
our own Cooks. The house-door was kept by a Desetnick, or Corporal, who had nine Musketiers
about him: but the Pristaf's came every day, to entertain and divert us; and immediately
after our first publick Audience, or as soon as we have been so happy as to have seen the
bright eyes of his Majesty the Czaar, as they express it, they gave us the same liberty as we
had at our former Voyage.
                  Arril 3.APRIL we had our first publick Audience, to which we were conducted with the same Ceremonies
as before, and, in our Cavalcade, we observ'd the same order as we had at our entrance;
unless it were, that the Secretary went next the Ambassadors carrying the Credential
Letters upon a great piece of Crimson Taffata. The Musketiers had made a lane from our
Lodging to the Castle, but all could not keep off the people from thronging in to see us.
                  The Courriers went and came, as their custome is, to give directions for our march; to order
it so, as that the Great Duke might ascend his Throne, just at the arrival of the Ambassadors.
                  The Ceremonies of the Audience were as is before mentioned. And the Propositions made
contained only complements, thanks for his Majesties favour, in granting the Ambassadors
a passage into Persia, and desires to have some secret conferences.
                  As soon as we were return'd to our Lodgings, came one of the Great Duke's Carvers, named
Knez, Simon Petrouits Luon, with forty dishes of meat from his Majesty, all Fish, fry'd
things, and pulse, it being in their Lent: and twelve pots of several sorts of drinks.
                  The Cloath being layd, and the meat serv'd up, he presented, with his own hand, to the Ambassadors
and those of their retinue, to every one a Gobelet full of a very strong Aquavitae, took
himself a great Vermilion gilt-cup, and drunk the Great Duke's health, then the young Prince's,
and then that of his Highness, obliging all to pledge him. He was presented with a piece of
Plate gilt, and those who brought in the meat had two Crowns a-piece given them.
                  We sate down; but most of the dishes being dress'd with Onions and Garlick, we eat very
little, and sent the rest to our friends in the City. But what we spar'd in meat, we made good
in drink, whereto we were partly encourag'd by the Persian Ambassadors, who being lodg'd
near us, gave us the divertisement of their Bagpipes, and Hautbois, and partly by the excellent
Wines, which the Great Duke had sent us.
                  Apr. 5. we had our first private Audience, with the ordinary Ceremonies, having the same
Commissioners we had in our former negotiation, except the Chancellour Iuan Tarassouits
Grammatin, who, by reason of age, had resign'd his charge, which was conferr'd upon Fedor
Fedorousin Lichozou. While we were at this Audience, there died at our Lodging one of our
Lacqueyes, who, some few dayes before, having been overturn'd in one of the Sledges, had
been hurt by the Ambassador Brugman's Cabinet, which fell upon his breast. Being of the reform'd
religion, his body was carried to the Church of that Profession, where he had a Funeral
Sermon, after which he was buried in the Church-yard belonging to the Germans. The
Great Duke sent us for the solemnity of the enterment, a Pristaf, and 15. white Horses out of
his own Stables.
                  The 9.The Palm-Sunday Procession. We had our second private Audience. The 10. being Palm-Sunday, the Muscovites
had a noble Procession, to represent our Saviour's entrance into Ierusalem, and, that we might

the more conveniently see it, having express'd our desires to that purpose, the Great Duke sent
the Ambassadors their ordinary Horses, and fifteen others for their retinue. He order'd also
to be kept for us a place, near the Castle-Gate, whence they drove out the people which had
throng'd in to the number of 10000. The Persian Ambassadors were plac'd behind us, in the
little Theatre we have spoken of before.
                  The Great Duke having been at service in our Lady's Church, came out of the Castle with
the Patriarch in very good order.
                  First, came a very large Chariot, made of boards nail'd together, but low, drawing after it
a Tree, on which hung abundance of Apples, Figs, and Grapes. In it were four little Boys
with surplisses, who sung the Hosanna.
                  Then follow'd many Priests, in their surplisses and copes, carrying Crosses, Banners, and
Images, upon long Poles; some of them sung, others cast Incense among the people. Next
came the Goses or Duke's Merchants; after them the Diaken, Clerks, Secretaries, Knez and
Boares, having, most of them Palms in their hands, and went immediately before the Great
Duke, who was most richly clad, with a Crown upon his head, supported by the two principal
Counsellors of State, Knez Iuan Borisowits Cyrcaski, and Knez Alexey Michaelouits
Won, and led, himself, by the bridle, the Patriarch's Horse, which was cover'd with Cloath,
and made to represent an Asse. The Patriarch, who rid on him, had on his head a round white
Satin Cap, beset with rich Pearls, and about it a very rich Crown. He had in his right hand
a Cross of Diamonds, wherewith he bless'd the people, who receiv'd his benediction with great
submission, bowing their heads, and incessantly making the sign of the Cross. About and behind
him were Metropolitans, Bishops, and other Priests, whereof some carried Books, others
Censers. About fifty little Boys, most clad in red, put off their Casacks and scatter'd them
along the way: others had pieces of Cloath about an Ell-square, of all colours, which they
laid on the ground, for the Great Duke and Patriarch to pass over. The Great Duke being
come over against us, made a halt, and sent his principal Interpreter, Iohn Helmes, to ask after
our health, and went not on till our answer was brought him. This done, he went into the
Church, where he stay'd about half an hour. In his return, he stopp'd again at the same place,
to give the Ambassadors notice that he would send them a Dinner from his own Table: which
yet was not done, but instead thereof, our ordinary allowance was doubled.
                  The honour the Great Duke did the Patriarch in leading his horse, is worth to him 400
Crowns, which the Patriarch is oblig'd to give him. Upon Pain-Sunday, the same Ceremonies
were observ'd all over Muscovy; the Metropolitanes and Bishops representing the person of
the Patriarch, the Weiwodes or Governours, that of the Great Duke.
                  April. 17. was their Easter-day. 'Tis the greatest of all their Festivals, and they celebrate it
with abundance of Ceremonies,The Muscov an celebration of Easter. and great rejoycings, as well in remembrance of our Saviour's
Resurrection, as that it puts a period to their Lent. The streets were all full of a sort of Merchants,
who sold Eggs of all sorts of colours, which the Muscovites send by way of Present
one to another, for a fortnight together after Easter, during which time, when they meet,
they kiss each other, and their salutation is in these words, Christos wos Chrest, that is, Christ
is risen, whereto the other answers, Wostin wos Chrest, that is, He is risen indeed. No person,
what condition, sex, or other quality soever he be of, dares refuse these kisses, or the
Eggs, that are presented to him. The Great Duke himself hath Presented some to the principal
Counsellors, and Lords of his Court. He is wont also, on Easter-day, betimes in the morning,
to visit the Prisoners before he goes to Church, and to order every one to have an Egg given
him, and some sheep-skin for bestow'd on them, exhorting them to rejoyce, since Christ
dy'd for their sins, and was now truly risen again. That done, he causes the Prison-doors to
be shut again, and goes to his Devotions. Their greatest rejoycings consist in Feasts, and
good Cheer; but especially in debauches, in common drinking-houses, which are full of all
sorts of persons, Men and Women, Ecclesiastick and Laicks, who get so drunk, that the
streets are pav'd with Drunkards. The present Patriarch hath prohibited them, and
order'd that on Easter-day no drinking places should be open; but he is not much
obey'd.
                  April 29.Brugman hath a private audience. The Ambassador Brugman desir'd, and had, a private audience of the Bojares; to
which he went alone, without his Collegue, and but few persons about him. It was given him
in the Exchequer, and lasted above two hours; what he treated about we could never learn, till
afterward, by the charge put in against him at our return home.
                  May 6.MAY. The Ambassadors had together their third conference with the Bojares; the 17. the
fourth; and the 27. the fifth and last private audience.
                  May 30. The Great Duke permitted the young Prince's Governour, to go a-hawking, and
to invite, to that Divertisement, the Gentlemen of our retinue. He sent us Horses, and carried
us two Leagues from the City into most pleasant Meadow grounds. Having sported two or
three hours, we were treated with a Collation, under a Tent pitch'd there for that end.
The treatment was ordinary, Strong-water, Hydromel, Ginger-bread, and preserv'd Cherries.
                  
                     
Iune 1.JUNE. The Muscovites celebrated with great solemnities the birth-day of their
young Prince, Knez Iuan Michaelouits. Our ordinary allowance of Provisions was
doubled.
                  The 3. The Ambassador Brugman had a second private conference with the Bojares. Iune 14.
being Whitsun-eve, the Great Duke gave publick audience to all the Ambassadors then in Mosco,
in order to their departure. That of Persia went first to audience: he was a Cupzn, or
Merchant; as he came back he had on his other Cloaths??? according to the Persian custom a
Garment of Crimson-Satin, lined with the best kind of Sables which the Great Duke had Presented
him with.
                  After him went the Greeks, Armenians, and Tartars, who in their return, caus'd their
Letters, and the Presents they had receiv'd, to be carried before them.
                  The 12. Arrived there our Controller, who had stay'd at Dantzick, to look after the
finishing of some Presents which we were to carry into Persia. The Great Duke was gone on a
Pilgrimage out of the City, and the Chancellor durst not permit the Controller to enter in
without his Majesties express order; which occasion'd his staying three dayes in the
Suburbs.
                  The 15.The great Dutchess her Cavalcade. The Great Duke and Dutchess return'd to Moscou. The Duke was attended by
a great number of Lords: the Dutchess had about her 36. Ladies, or Maids of honour.
They were all on Horse-back, sitting a-stride, cloath'd in red, white Hats on their heads, with
great red bands dangling at their backs, white Scarfs about their necks; they were most
wickedly be-painted.
                  The 17. I was sent to the Chancellor, to speak to him concerning our dispatches. He would
do me the greatest honour I could expect, and order'd, I should be brought in to audience by a
Pristaf. That importunate civility cost me two hours attendance in the Antichamber, till a
Pristaf was found. The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor receiv'd me kindly, and dismiss'd me
well satisfy'd. The Table in the Audience Chamber was cover'd with a very rich Persian Carpet,
upon which was a silver Standish, but without any Ink in it: I was told afterwards,
that they were set there only for the time I was to stay in the room, which was but poorly furnish'd
without them.
                  The 20. The Pristafs came to tell us, that we might take our journey for Persia when we
pleas'd, and that at our return thence, we should have the honour to kiss his Majesties hand, it
being not fit they did it then, since the Ambassadors were not to return into their own Country,
and that at the last publick audience only, the Great Duke was oblig'd to answer the Credentials
they had brought.
                  We accordingly prepar'd for our departure, got Boats to be provided to carry us upon the
River to Nisa, and took into our service, three Lieutenants, four Serjeants, and twenty three
Souldiers, Scots and Germans. The Great Duke gave us leave to take them out of his own
Guard, for our security against the incursions of the Tartars, which make travelling neer
Wolgda very dangerous. We also hir'd certain Muscovites, for ordinary Employments. The
24. and 25. were spent in putting our things aboard, and sending away certain brass Guns we
had brought out of Germany, and some Cabinets we had bought at Moscou, and part of our Baggage,
ordering the Conductor to stay for us at Nisa.
                  The 26.The entrance of Ambassadors from Poland. came in Ambassadors, or, as the Mvscovites call them, Courriers of quality, from
the King of Poland. We went out of the City, to observe their entrance. As soon as they perceiv'd
us, they saluted us very civilly, putting off their Hats, but their demeanour towards the
Muscovites was much wanting of respect, never offering to be uncovered. They also oblig'd
the Pristefs to alight, and uncover themselves first, saying, they were not there to do the Muscovites
any honour, but to receive it from them. There were no Horses out the Great Duke's
Stables at the entrance of these Ambassadors, because another Polish Ambassador, had, some
few dayes before, refus'd them, and made use of his own.
                  This other Polish Ambassador had been sent to the Great Duke immediately after the defeat
of the Muscovites before Smolensco,The fierceness of a Polish Ambassador. which gave him occasion to be so insolent as he was, during
his stay at Mosco. He would needs make his proposition sitting, and perceiving that,
when he pronounc'd the name and titles of his King, the Bojares were not uncover'd, he stopp'd,
till such time as the Grand Duke had commanded them to be so??? The King of Poland had sent
the Great Duke no Present, but the Ambassador gave him, as from himself, a very fair Coach???
and yet when the Duke sent him a rich Present of Sables, he refus'd them. Whereupon the
Great Duke sent back his Coach, which the Ambassador being angry at, took that occasion to
tumble the Pristaf from the top of a high pair of stairs to the bottom. The Great Duke was so
incens'd thereat, that he sent one to tell the Ambassador, that he knew not, whether this demeanour
of his was according to his Master's order, or that the rudeness proceeded from his
own passion; that if his King had commanded him to do so, patience must be had, till God
enabled him to express his resentment of it, that the event of War was in his hands, and
that another time he might be the more fortunate: but that if he had done this without

order, and upon his own accompt, complaint should be made of it to the King his Master.
                  The 26 of Iune, the Pristaf brought us the Great Dukes Pass, which for the odness of the
stile,The Great Duke's Pass. we think fit to insert here, faithfully translated out of the Muscovian language.
                  From the Grand Seigneur and Great Duke of all the Russes, Michael Federouits; We enjoyn all
our Bojares, Weiwodes and Diaken, and all our Commanders from the City of Moscou to Columna,
and thence to Perestaf, Resansky, and Kasimoua, to Murama, and Nise-Novogorod,
to Casan, and Astrachan, to let pass Philip Crusius and Otton Brugman, Ambassadors and
Counsellours from Frederick, Duke of Holstein, whom we have permitted to go from Moscou into
Persia, to Schach Sefi of Persia: by vertue of a Treaty made for the Passage and Commerce of
the Merchants of Holstein. We have also permitted them to take along with them their Germans
of Holstein, to the number of 85 persons, and for their convoy 30 Souldiers, chosen, with our
consent, out of the Germans, who serve in Muscovy, which number they may augment, for the
safety of their Voyage of Persia, at Nisa, Cassan, or Astrachan, by eleven men, Germans or
Muscovites, voluntiers. We also permit them, at Nisa, to hire two Pilots, who are acquainted
with the course of the Wolgda. We consent, and in like manner permit the said Ambassadors of
Holstein, if, at their return from Persia, they stand in need of a Convoy, or other people for business,
to take at Cassan, or Astrachan, or any where else they shall think fit, forty men, or such
other number as they shall think requisite for the prosecution of their Voyage: provided, that those of
our people who shall hire themselves to the said Ambassadors, gave in their names to the Bojres,
Weiwodes, and Diaken of the place of their abode, as well at their departure thence, as at their
return thither, that there may be a Register kept thereof. And if they return from Persia in the
Winter, it shall be lawful for them, for their money, to take into their service such a number of
men, and Sledges, as they shall think requisite for the continuation of their Voyage.
                  We have also appointed Rodiuon Gabao, Gentleman of Astrachan, to conduct the said Ambassadors
from Moscou to Asttachan, Wherefore we command you, our Bojares; Weiwodes,
Diaken, and Commanders, to let pass the said Rodiuon, with the Ambassadors of Holstein,
Without any lt. And if after their Voyage of Persia, at their return thence, they are desirous to
to repass through the Countries in our obedience, you shall permit them to take into their service,
for labour, or for convoy upon the Wolga, forty men, or such other number as they shall stand in
need of, which they shall take by vertue of this present Pass-port, at Astrachan, Cassan, or any
other place they shall think fit. And our said Subjects shall be oblig'd to cause their names to be enroll'd,
as well at their departure as at their return, to the end notice may be taken, that no Robbers,
Golops, or fugitive Slaves get in among them. In like manner at the return of their Voyage,
if they pass through Muscovy in the Winter time, it shall be lawfull for them, at their own
charge, to hire such a number of Sledges, as they shall think fit, so as that they be not hindred in
the prosecution of their Voyage, either in Cities or in the Country. Enjoyning further, that all
respect be given to the Ambassadors of Holstein, and all civillity done their people, both going and
coming, not permitting that they should suffer any violence, or be robbed: obliging them also, for
their part, not to take any provisions by force of any whatsoever; but it shall be lawful for them, to
buy, for their money, of those that shall be willing to sell to them, both going and coming. Writ
at Moscou, in the year 7144. June 20. and signed, The Czaar, and Great Duke of all
the Russes, Michael Federouits; and lower, Deak Maxim Matuskin; and sealed with the
great Seal.
                  The Pristaf having given us our Pass-port,The Ambassadors leave Moscou. we appointed Iun. 30. for our departure. Mr.
David Ruts gave us another entertainment that day, and kept us till the last hour of the day,
which (the Muscovites beginning it at Sun-rising, and ending it at Sun-set) having struck,
the Pristaf caus'd to be brought out the Great Dukes Horses, and hasten'd our departure, being
accompany'd by several persons of quality, who brought us as far as the Monastery of Simana,
three leagues from Moscou, where our Boat waited for us, avoiding by that means the many
windings of the River from Moscou thither.
                  But it were not handsome to leave Moscou without giving some account of that great City,A description of Moscou. the
Metropolis of all Muscovy, to which it gives the name, as it takes its own from the River
Moska. This River, which passes through, and divides all the rest of the City, from that quarter
of it which is called Strelitza Slauoda, rises out of the Province of Tuere, and having joyn'd
its waters with those of the Occa, near Columna, it falls together with the other, about half a
league thence, into the Wolga. The City is elevated 55 degr. 36 min. its longitude 66 degrees,
in the midst of all the Country, and almost at an equal distance from all the Frontiers, which
is above 120 German leagues. It is about three leagues about, and, no doubt, hath been heretofore
bigger than it is now. Mathius de Michou, a Canon of Cracovid, who ourish'd at
the beginning of the last age, says, that, in his time, it was twice as big as the City
of Prague. The Tartars of Crim and Precop, burnt it in the year 1571. and the Poles
set it a-fire in the year 1611. so as that there was nothing left of it but the Castle; and yet
now there are numbred in it above 40000 houses, and it is out of all controversie one of the
greatest Cities in Europe.
                  
                     
'Tis true, that, the Palaces of great Lords, and the Houses of some rich Merchants excepted,
which are of Brick or Stone, all the rest are of Wood, and made up of beams, and cross-pieces
of Firr laid one upon another.Its building most of Wood. They cover them with barks of trees, upon which they
sometimes put another covering of Turfes. The carelesness of the Muscovites, and the disorders
of their house-keeping are such, that there hardly passes a moneth, nay not a week, but
some place or other takes fire, which, meeting with what is very combustible, does in a moment
reduce many houses, nay, if the wind be any thing high, whole streets into ashes. Some
few days before our arrival, the fire had consumed the third part of the City; and about 5 or 6
years since, the like accident had near destroy'd it all. To prevent this, the Strelits of the
Guard, and the Watch, are enjoyn'd, in the night time to carry Pole-axes, wherewith they
break down the houses adjoyning to those which are a-fire, by which means they hinder the
progress of it, with much better success than if they attempted the quenching of it. And that it
may not fasten on other more solid structures, the doors and windows are very narrow, having
shutters of Latin, to prevent the sparks and flashes from getting in. Those who have their houses
burnt, have this comfort withall, that they may buy houses ready built, at a market for
that purpose, without the white-Wall, at a very easy rate, and have them taken down, transported,
and in a short time set up in the same place where the former stood.
                  The streets of Moscou are handsome, and very broad, but so dirty, after rain hath ever so
little moisten'd the ground, that it were impossible to get out of the dirt, were it not for the
great Posts, which set together make a kind of bridge, much like that of the Rhin, near Strasbourg
which bridges, in foul weather, serve for a kind of pavement.
                  The City is divided into four quarters,Catayrogod. or circuits, whereof the first is called Catayrogod,
that is, the mid-City, as being in the midst of the others. This quarter is divided from the
rest by a brick-wall, which the Muscovites call crasne stenna, that is, red stone. The Moska
passes on the South-side of it??? and the River Neglina, which joyns with the other behind the
Castle,Cremelena. on the North side. The Great Duke's Palace, called Cremelena, and which is of greater
extent than many other ordinary Cities, takes up almost one half of it, and is fortify'd with
three strong walls, and a good ditch, and very well mounted with Canon. In the midst of the
Castle are two Steeples, one very high, and cover'd with Copper gilt, as all the other Steeples
of the Castle are. This Steeple is called Iuan Welike, that is, the Great Iohn. The other
is considerable only for the Bell within it, made by the Great Duke Boris Gudenou, weighing
33600. pounds. It is not toll'd, but upon great Festivals, or to honour the entrance and audience
of Ambassadors: but to stir it there must be 24 men, who pull it by a Rope that comes
down into the Court, while some others are above to help it on by thrusting. The Great
Duke's Palace stands towards the further side of the Castle, with that of the Patriarch, and
appartements for several Bojares, who have places at Court. There is also lately built a very fair
Palace of stone, according to the Italian Architecture, for the young Prince; but the Great
Duke continues still in his wooden Palace, as being more healthy than stone-structures. The
Exchequer, and the Magazine of Powder and provisions are also within the Castle.
                  There are also within it two fair Monasteries, one for men, the other for women, and
above fifty Churches and Chapels, all built of stone; among others, those of the B.
Trinity, St. Mary's, St. Michael's, wherein are the Sepulchres of the Great Dukes, and St.
Nicholas's.
                  At the Castle-Gate, but without the Walls, on the South-side, is a fair Church Dedicated
to the B. Trinity, and commonly called Ierusalem. When it was finish'd, the Tyrant Iohn
Basilouits, thought it so magnificent a structure, that he caus'd the Architect's eyes to be put
out, that he might not afterwards do any thing that should be comparable to that. Near this
Church are two great pieces of Canon, with the mouths towards that street by which
the Tartars were wont to make their irruptions; but these pieces are now dismounted, and
useless.
                  In the spacious place, before the Castle, is the chief Market of the City kept; all day it is
full of people, but especially slaves, and idle persons. All the Market-place is full of Shops,
as also all the streets abutting upon it: but every Trade hath a station by it self, so as the Mercers
intermingle not with the Linnen or Wollen-Drapers, nor Goldsmiths with Sadlers, Shoemakers,
Taylors, Furriers, and the like, but every Profession and Trade hath its proper
street: which is so much the greater convenience, in that a man does, of a sudden, cast his eye
on all he can desire. Sempstresses have their shops in the midst of the Market, where there is
also another sort of Women Traders, who have Rings in their mouths, and, with their Rubies
and Turquoises, put off another commodity which is not seen in the Market. There is a
particular street where are sold the Images of their Saints. 'Tis true, these go not under the
name of Merchandise, among the Muscovites, who would make some difficulty to say they
had bought a Saint; but they say, they receive them by way of Exchange or Trucking, for
money: and so when they buy, they make no bargain, but lay down what the Painter
demands.
                  
                     
There is yet another place, in this quarter, called the Hair-market, because the Inhabitants
go thither to be trimm'd, by which means the place comes to be so cover'd with hair, that a man
treads as softly as if it were on a Feather-bed. Most of the principal Goses, or Merchants, as
also many Knez and Muscovian Lords have their houses in this first circuit.
                  The second quarter is called Czaargorod,Czaargorod. that is, Czaar's Citie, or the Citie-Royal, and includes
the former as it were in a Semi-circle. The little River Neglina passes through the midst
of it, and it hath its particular Wall, called Biela stenna, that is, the white Wall. In this quarters
is the Arsenal, and the place, where Guns and Bells are cast, which is called Pogganabrut,
the management whereof the Great Duke hath bestow'd on a very able man, one Iohn
Valk, born at Nuremberg, whom he sent for out of Holland, for this reason, that he was the
first who found a way to discharge a Bullet of sixteen pound weight with five pound of pouder.
The Muscovites who have wrought under this man, have so well learnt the Mystery of founding
that now they are as expert at it as the most experienc'd Germans.
                  In this quarter also there live many Knez, Lords, Sinbojares, or Gentlemen, and a great
number of Merchants, who drive a Trade all the Countrey over, and Trades-men especially
Bakers. There are also some Butchers shambles, and Tipling-houses, which sell Beer, Hydromel,
and Strong-water, Store-Houses of Wheat, Meal shops, and the Great Duke's stables.
                  The third quarter is called Skoradom,Skoradom and includes the quarter called Czaargorod, from the
East, along the North-side, to the West. The Muscovites affirm, that this quarter was five
German Leagues about, before the City was burnt by the Tartars, in the year 1571. The little
River Iagusas passes through it, and in its way fails into the Mosca. In this quarter is the
Market for Wood and Houses before mentioned; where you may have Houses ready made,
which may be taken asunder, transported thence, and set up any where else, in a short time, and
with little pains and charge, since they consist only of beams, and posts, set one upon the other,
and the vacuities are fill'd up with Mosse.
                  The fourth quarter is called Strelitza Slauoda,Strelitza. Slauoda. because of the Strelits, or Musketiers of the
Great Duke's Guard, who live in it. It is situated towards the South of Citarogod, on the
other side of the Mosca, upon the Avenues of the Tartars. Its Ramparts and Baltions are of
Wood. The Great Duke Basili Iuanouits, father of Basilouits, who built this quarter, design'd
it for the quarters of such Soldiers, as were strangers, as Poles, Germans, and others, naming
that place Naeilki, or, the quarter of Drunkards, from the word Nali, which signifies, powre
out: for, these strangers being more inclin'd to drunkenness than the Muscovites, he would
not have his own people, who were apt enought to debauch themselves, to become so much the
worse by the others bad example. Besides the Soldiery, the poorer sort of the people have their
habitations in this quarter.
                  There is,The number of Churches and Chapels in Moscou. in the City and Suburbs of Moscou, a very great number of Churches, Monasteries
and Chapels. In the former Impression of these Travels, we said, there were above fifteen
hundred; but whereas Iohn Lewis Godefrey, Author of the Archontologia Cosinica, thinks that
number so excessive, that he sticks not to speak of it as a thing not likely to be true, I must indeed
needs acknowledge, that I was much mistaken, and, now affirm for certain, that where I said
there were 1500. there are above 2000. No Muscovite that hath liv'd at Moscou, nay no
stranger, any thing acquainted with that City, but will confirm this truth, as knowing, there
is no Lord but hath his private Chapel, nor any Street but hath many of them. 'Tis true, they
are most of them very small ones, and but fifteen foot square; nay, before the Patriarch commanded
they should be built of Stone, they were all of Wood: but that hinders not, but that
the number of them may amount to what we have said.
                  
                     
                     
                     

                     
                     

                  
               
            
            
               
               
               THE
TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, and PERSIA.
               The Third Book.
               
                  THE City of Moscou, which those of the Country call Moskwa,1636??? derives its
name to the Province, wherein it is seated, and to all Muscovy, which was
heretofore known under that of Russia, or white Russia.Muscovy described. It is doubtless, the
greatest of all the Estates of Europe, since it reaches in length near thirty degrees,
or 450. leagues; and, in breadth, sixteen degrees, or 240. German leagues.
Its Frontiers reach, Northward, beyond the Arctick Circle to the frozen Sea.
On the East, it hath the River Oby; towards the South, the Tartars of Crim and Precop; and
towards the West, Poland, Livonia and Sueden.
                  Muscovy is divided into many great Provinces,The Province of Woledimer. most of which we have named elsewhere with
the Titles of the Great Duke. That of Wolodimer, or Vladimer, was heretofore the chiefest.
Its capital City, whence it hath its name, was built by Prince Wolodomer, who liv'd about the
year 928. It is 36. leagues distant from Moscou, Eastward, between the Rivers of Occa, and
Wolga, in a Country so fruitful, that one Bushel of Wheat sown, yeelds 25. or 30. The River
Clesma, which passes by it, falls into the River Occa near the City of Murom. The Great
Dukes had chosen it for the most convenient place for their residence, till Prince Danilou Michaelouits
translated the Emperial Seat to Moscou.
                  The Province of Smolensko hath,Smolensko on the East, the Province of Muscovy, on the North, Siberia,
on the South, Lithavie, and towards the West, Livonia. The Metropolis of the Province,
Smolensko, is seated upon the River Nieper, which they say is the same the Antients called
Boristhenes, though that of Berezine comes nearer to that name. The other eminent Cities
of it, are, Prohobus, upon the Nieper, Wesma, upon a River of the same name, and Mosaysko.
The City of Smolensko hath, on the side of the River, a Cittadel, fortify'd with great Chains
and good Ditches, with a good Counterscarp well palisadoed. The Muscovites took this City
from the Poles in the year 154. Sigismond King of Poland Recover'd it again in the year 1611.
and the late Great Duke Michael Federouits besieg'd it in the year 1633. but was forc'd to raise
the siege, as we shall have occasion to relate anon. The Great Duke that now is took it by composition,
in the year 1654. and is still possess'd of it.
                  The Province of Rhesan lies between the Rivers Don and Occa,Rhesan. having on the West, Muscovy,
from which it is divided by the River Aka. This is the most fruitful Province of all Muscovy,
and produces abundance of Wheat, Hony, Fish, and all sorts of Venizon and Fowl. Besides the
chief City, which is upon the River Occa, it hath also those of Corsira, and Tulla, upon the River
of that name.
                  
                     
Permie is one of the greatest Provinces of all Muscovy, and distant from Moscou 250. or
300. German leagues, towards the East and North. Its chief City, whence it hath its name,
lies upon the River of Vischora,Permie. which falls into Kam, 15. leagues thence. The Inhabitants of
this Province have a Language and Characters peculiar to themselves. They eat Herbs instead
of bread, and instead of Tribute, send the Great Duke, Horses and Furrs. Its neighbours Eastward
are the Tartars of Tumen.
                  The Baron of Herberstein sayes,Jugarie. that the Province of Iugarie, is that whence the Hongrians
came, who now live in the Country that lies upon the Dannow,
                  The Province of Wiathka,Wiathka. is 150. German leagues distant from the City of Moscou, towards
the East, beyond the River Kam. The River of Wiathka gives it the name; which falls into
Kam, which falls into Wolga 12. leagues below Casan. The Country is woody and barren,
and much subject to the incursions of the Tartars Czeremisses, who were the Masters of it, till
Basili, Great Duke of Muscovy, united it to his Crown.
                  The Principality of Bielsk derives the name from Biela its chief City;Bielks. as does the Province
of Rschouie from that of the City of Rschewa;Rschouie. and that of Tuere,Tuere. from the City of that
name.
                  The City and Dutchy of Plescou was govern'd by its own Princes,Plescou. till the Great Duke Iohn
Basilouits re-united both to his Crown, in the year 1509. The Muscovites call it Pskow, from
the Lake upon which the chief City is seated, and out of which rises the River of the same name,
that passes through the City.
                  Siberia is of great extent,Siberie. and had a long time its own Princes, who paid Tribute to the
Kings of Poland, upon the accompt of Lithuania, on which they had some dependence. They
revolted from Casimer, son of Iagellon, King of Poland, and became subject to the Great Duke
of Muscovy. The Czaar Basili, ejected the Duke of Siberie, and united the Province to his
Crown. The chief City is Novogorod, but to distinguish it from others of the same name, it is
called Novogorod Siebersky, that is, Novogorod, or the New City of Siberie. Its other eminent
Cities are Starodub, Petivola, Czernigou, and Bransko.
                  The Dutchies of Iarostaf,Jarostaf. Rosthou,Rosthou. and SusdalSusdal. were a long time enjoy'd by the younger Brothers
of Muscovy, till Iohn Basilouits re-united them to the Crown, in the year 1565.
                  The Province of Dwina is the greatest,Dwina. and more Northern of all Muscovy, and was heretofore
subject to the Duke of Novogorod. The River of Dwina falls into the white Sea, near
Archangel. It is not long since that this Province, which is a hundred leagues in length, had
but one City in it, of the same name seated in the midst of it: but now that the Muscovites
have Translated into those parts, the Trade which the English, Dutch, and Hanseatick Towns,
were wont to bring to Narva, it is become one of the most considerable Provinces of all Muscovy.
The greatest place of Commerce is called Archangel,Archangel. from the Archangel, St. Michael,
and situated at the mouth of the Dwina, where it makes the Island of Podesemski. The City is
not very great, but of great Trading, by reason of the many Ships that come every year, which
bring thither the Muscovian Merchants, especially those strangers that live at Moscou, with
the commodities of the Country, to truck for those that are brought thither. The Great Duke
makes great advantages of it; but the Impositions he laies upon all Merchandlses are so great,
that it is not unlikely Strangers will, in time, return to Narva, where the King of Sueden takes
but two in the hundred, and, to which, navigation is not so dangerous.
                  In the Gulf, which the Sea makes near the mouth of Dwina, are three Islands, called Solofka,
Anger, and Coloua. There was heretofore in the former of these the Sepulchre of a Muscovian
Saint, but 3. or 4. years since, the Great Duke caused the Body to be translated thence to
Moscou. Some report, that the Great Dukes, Predecessors of him that now reigns, had
hidden a great Treasure there, as being a place inaccessible, by reason of its high and steepy
Rocks.
                  The Province of Vstiugha is next to that of Dwina,Ustiugha. but more Southerly, and was also subject
to the Duke of Novogorod. The chief City, of the same name, is so called from the word
Vst, which signifies the mouth of a River, as the Latine word, Ostium; and Iugh, because it
was seated at the place where the River of Iugh falls into Suchana, from which it is now half a
league distant. Its Inhabitants eat no Bread, but are content with Fish and Venison dry'd in the
Sun. Thence are brought the fairest black-Foxes skins.
                  Vologda,Vologda. seated in the Province of the same name, is the only City in all Muscovy that hath a
stone wall about it, being the place whither the Great Duke, in time of War, was wont to send
some part of his Treasures. It sometime belonged to the Duke of Novogorod, but is now, together
with the Province, re-united to Muscovy. The River of Vologda, whence it takes its
name, falls, with the Dwina, into the white Sea.
                  The Dutchy of Bielejezoro is also one of the Northern Provinces of this great State,Bielejezoro. but so
full of Woods and Rivers, that it is in a manner inaccessible, unless it be when the Fenns and
Rivers are frozen.
                  The Province of Petzora reaches along the frozen Sea,Petzora. towards the East and North. The

River of Petzora, whence it hath the name, falls into the Sea near the Streight of Weigats,
below the City of Pustioziero, by six several channels. The mountains, which the Muscovites
call Zimnopoias, that is, the Girdle of the Earth, (the same, as it is believed, as the Antients
called the Riphaean and Hiperborean mountains) lye on both sides of it, and afford the best
Sables, and excellent Hawks. The City is but little, and the cold so great in this Province,
that the Rivers are frozen from August to May. Upon this Province border the Samoicdes, a
people we shall have occasion to speak of hereafter.
                  The Province of Obdorie derives its name from the River Oby,Obdorie. which rising out of the great
Lake of Kataisko, and running from the East towards the North, falls into the frozen Sea, and
is so broad at the mouth, that with a very good wind a Ship will have much ado to cross from
one side to the other in two days.
                  As for the Tartarian Provinces that are subject to the Great Duke,The source of Wolga. we shall give an accompt
of them in the prosecution of our Travels along the River Wolga; of which River we shall only
say by the way, that in the Province of Rschouie, two leagues from its chief City, and in
the great forest of Wolkowskiles, is the Lake of Wronow, out of which rises a River, that, two
leagues off that place, falls into the Lake of Wolga, from which it derives its name, and is
thence forward called Wolga. The Tartars call it Edel, and 'tis the same as Ptolomy calls Rha.
'Tis doubtless, the greatest River in all Europe; since that from the City of Nise-Novogorod,
near which we went into it, out of the River Ocea, to the Caspian Sea, we have counted above
500 German leagues, not accounting above a hundred leagues more there is from its source
to the place where the Occa falls into it.
                  The Boristhenes,Boristhianes. which those of the Country call Dnieper, rises out of the same Province,
ten leagues from the Lake of Fronowo, near a Village called Dniepersko. It divides Lithuania
from Muscovy, and after it hath taken its course towards the South, where it passes near
Wiesma, and thence towards the East, bathing the Cities of Progobus, Smolensko, Orscha,
Dubrowna, and Mohilouw, it turns again towards the South, and passing by Kiouie, by the
Circasses, and thence toward Otzakow, a City of the Tartarians of Precop, it falls into the Euxine
Sea.
                  There are,Dwina in Muscovy, two Rivers called Dwina; one rises out of a Lake of the same name,
ten leagues from the Lake of Fronowo, and the source of Dnieper, and falls into the Baltick
Sea, below Riga. The other rising at the conjunction of the Rivers of Iagel and Sachana, gives
its name to the Province before mentioned, and falls into the White Sea, near Archangel. The
Rivers of Mosca and Occa are pleasant and very considerable; but, they lose their names,
with all the other Rivers in the Countrey, when they fall into those we have before spoken
of.
                  Muscovy then being of such extent, as we have said, it is not to be imagin'd, that in Provinces
so distant,The Air of Muscovy. and situated in so different climates, Air and Earth are alike qualify'd every
where. About Moscou and the adjacent Provinces, the Air is good and healrhy, so that there
is no talk of the Plague, or any other Epidemical disease. Which was the reason, that in the
year 1654. at the beginning of the War of Smolensko, when the Infection made such havock
in that great City, people were the more surpriz'd thereat, in regard the like had not been
known in the memory of man. It was so great, that those were seen dying in the streets, who
thought themselves well enough when they came out of their houses; and all Muscovy was so
astonish'd at it, that all the Avenues of Moscou were block'd up.
                  The cold is so piercing,Extremely cold. that no fur can prevent the Nose, Ears, Feet, and Hands from freezing
and falling. At our first Voyage thither, in 1634. the cold was so sharp, that, in the
great Market-place, before the Castle, we saw the earth open above twenty fathoms in length,
and a foot broad. We could not go 50 steps, without hazard of losing some of our members.
I saw there by experience, what others have left in writing, that spittle froze before it came
to the ground, and water as it dropp'd.
                  I observ'd withal, that the earth is open there in a manner as soon as in Germany, and that
the Spring fruits come much about the same time; for the more the earth is cover'd with Snow,
the more it keeps in the heat requisite to promote vegetation. The Ice and Snow together make
the ways so even, that it is much easier travelling there than any where else. For Winter-travelling,
the Muscovites make use of Sledges, made very low, of the bark of Trees, cover'd
with some coarse kind of Cloath. We lay all along in them, and covering our selves with
sheep-skins, and the Sledges being cover'd with Sack-cloath, or some coarse Cloath, we not
only felt not the cold, but even sweated in the depth of Winter.
                  The Muscovian Horses are very low, yet fit enough for this kind of travelling, for being
swift and indefatigable, they will go 8. 10. nay many times 12 leagues without staying by the
way. I have my self travell'd twice from Tuere to Torsock without any halt by the way.
Hence is it that travelling is so cheap, that a Country fellow shall bring you fifty leagues for
three or four Crowns at most.
                  
                     
If the cold be sharp in the Winter, the heat is no less troublesom in Summer, not proceeding
so much from the scorching rayes of the Sun (which is there in a manner always above the Horizon,Very hot in Summer.
and makes the day 18. hours long) as occasion'd by the Flies, Wasps, Gnats, and
other insects, which the Sun produces in the Moors and Fens, which take up a great part of the
Country, in such abundance, that night and day they are extremely troublesome,
                  But,Fertility. the Fens and Forests, which Muscovy is well stor'd with, hinder not but the Land they
cultivate is very Fertile. For unless it be about Mosco, where the soyl is barren and gravelly,
let them take ever so little pains with their grounds in other places, they will bring forth more
Wheat and Pasture than the Countrey can consume. The Hollanders acknowledge, that Muscovy
is to them what Sicily was sometime to Rome. You never hear talk of dearth, though in
the Provinces that have not the convenience of Rivers to transport their Corn, the Inhabitants
manure only so much ground as will afford them a bare subsistence for the present year, not
minding the future, as confident their ordinary increase will never fail them. Thence it comes
that so much excellent ground lies fallow, producing only Hay, whereof they mow no more than
will serve their Cattel.
                  There is so great difference between this soyl,Muscovy more fertile than Livonia. and that of the Province of Allentaken in Livonia,
though there lies only the River Narva between them, that as soon as a man is over he
perceives it. Muscovy and the Northern Provinces of Livonia have this common with Inguermannia
and Carelia, that they sow not their Corn till within three weeks of Midsummer; for
the cold having,The seed-time. as a man might say, pierc'd to the Centre of the earth, it must have leasure to
unfreeze: but the Wheat is no sooner in the ground but it puts forth, and the heat of the Sun,
which, as we said, is alwayes above the Horizon, advances and ripens it. So that Sowing and
Harvest is all over in two moneths.Their harvest. Wherein the Muscovites have this advantage over the
Livonians, that they put in their Wheat dry, and ready to be thrash'd, whereas the Livonians
are forc'd to use fire to dry it, by the help of a great Oven, built in the midst of a Barn, where
they put their sheaves upon beams lay'd a-cross, till such time as the heat hath so dry'd them,
that beating them with a stick, the Grain falls out, so as that there is no need of thrashing or
treading it, as they do in the East. There is yet this further inconvenience, that the Wheat thus
dry'd is not good for seed, and many times the Barns take fire, which spreads into the houses
about them, and consumes all.
                  In those Provinces which are not so much towards the North,The fruits of Muscovy. especially neer the City of
Mosco, their are excellent fruits, as Apples, Cherries, Plums, and Goos-berries. I have seen
Apples in beauty and colour much like those which are called Appians, and so transparent, that
holding them between your sight and the Sun, you may easily tell the Kernels. 'Tis true this
fruit having not time to bake in the Sun, (it being rather a moderate slow heat, than an excessive
scorching, that consumes the superfluous moisture) will not keep, as it would do in Germany
and other more Southerly Countreys: but the Commentator upon the Maps of Atlas is
nevertheless mistaken, when he sayes, after the Baron of Herberstein, and Guagnin, that the
cold is so great in Muscovy, that the Countrey cannot produce Apples or other Fruits that are
worth sending up to the Table. They have also all manner of Pulse, Pot-herbs, Asparagus,
Onions, Garlick, Roots, Cowcumber, Citruls, or Gourds, and Melons, and of these last
abundance, excellent good, and so big, that at my being in Muscovy in the year 1643. a friend
presented me with a Melon,Extraordinary Melons. that weigh'd forty pound. The Muscovites are very expert in the
ordering of their Melons. They steep the seed, for the space of 48. hours, in Cow's milk, or
an infusion of fair water and Sheep's dung: their beds they make of Horse dung, as it is carried
out of the Stable, six foot deep, and then cover them with the best mold, in which they make
flat Trenches, about a foot and a half broad. They thrust the seed so deep into the bed, as that
it may not only be secur'd from the cold, and receive the benefit of the Sun-shine, but also have
the advantage of the heat which the dung sends up from below, covering it in the night, and
some times all day long, with bells of the Country-glass, or talk. They do not transplant
them, but are careful to take away what is superfluous, and do what other things are commonly
practis'd in other places, about that plant.
                  We were credibly inform'd, that near Samara, between Wolga and the Doa, there is a kind
of Melons, or rather Gourds, that are form'd like a Lamb, whereof this fruit represents all the
members, being fasten'd to the ground by the stalk, which is as it were its navel. As it grows
it changes place, as far as the stalk will give way, and, as it turns, makes the grass to wither.
The Muscovites call this browzing, or feeding, adding, that when it is ripe, the stalk withers,
and the fruit is cloath'd with a hairy skin, which may be dress'd and used instead of Furr. They
call this fruit Boranez,Boranez. that is to say, the Lamb. They shew'd us some of those skins, taken
off the covering of a bed, and swore they came from that fruit, but we could hardly believe it.
They were covered with a soft frizling Wooll not unlike that of a Lamb newly wean'd, or taken
out of the Sheep's belly. Iulius Scaliger makes mention of it, Exerc. 181. and sayes this
fruit grows till the grass fails it, and that it dies not but for want of nourishment. He adds, that
no Beast will feed on it, but the Wolf, and that it is us'd as a bait to take him, which the Muscovites
also confirmed.
                  
                     
It is not long that they have had Flowers and sweet Herbs, the Great Duke Michael Federouits
being the first that bestow'd any expence in Gardening, which he did with very good success.Flowers,
Nor is it long that they have had any other than wild Roses. Peter Marcellis,
Commissary from the King of Denmark and Duke of Holstein, brought the first Provence-Roses
thither.
                  The Holand and German Merchants have but lately planted Asparagus there,Asparagus. which take very
well, and are as big as a mans thumb. Nor have the Muscovites been long acquainted with
Lettice and other Salad-herbs, and laugh'd at the Strangers who fed on them; but now they
begin to like them. There are no Hazel-trees, nor Vines in Muscovy; but the Dutch bring
such quantities of several sorts of Wine thither by the way of Archangel, that there is no want
of any. There is also within these few years some brought in from Astrachan, upon the River
of Wolga.
                  Muscovy, abounds in Hemp and Flax; and there is so much Honey and VVax, even
in the VVoods, that, besides what is spent in Hydromel, and in Wax-Candles, in
this Commodity consists the greatest part of the commerce which the Muscovites have
with Strangers, to whom they put off yearly above twenty thousand Quintals (or hundred
weight) of Wax.
                  All Muscovy being but a continued Forest,Venison and Fowl. those places only excepted where they have fir'd
the Woods in order to agriculture, it must needs be very well furnish'd with all sorts of Venizon
and Fowl. Whence it comes, that Heath-cocks, Feasants of several kinds, and Patridges
are very cheap; as also wild Geese, and Ducks; Herons and Swans are not much esteem'd;
much less Thrushes, Fildevars, Quails, Larks, and other small Birds, which the Country
people will not take the pains to look after. There are no Storks in Muscovy, nor yet in Livonia;
but abundance of Birds of prey, as Faulcons, Tassels, &c. In the more Northerly Provinces
there are white ones, which are much esteem'd because of their ratity.
                  There is all sorts of Venison,No Deer. Deer excepted; Of Elks and wild Boars abundance. The Hares
are grey, but in some Provinces they turn white in Winter, as in Livonia; and yet in Courland,
which is contiguous to that Province, and divided from it only by the River Dune, the
Hares change not their colour. 'Tis no hard matter to find the reason of this change, which
must proceed from external cold; since I have known, that, even in Summer, Hares have
chang'd their colour, when they have been kept some time in a Cave.
                  The same Forests breed also abundance of Bears,Furre. Wolves, Linxes, Tigres, Foxes, Martins,
and Sables, the skins whereof are the most considerable Traffick of the Country, since
that some years, the Muscovites sell to Strangers as many as come to a Million of Gold, besides
what is spent in the Country, or presented to the Great Duke. The most esteem'd Furrs are
the skins of black Foxes, Sibles, Castors, white Bears, Ermins, and Squirrels.
                  The Bears and Wolves do abundance of mischief, and are as dangerous upon the high-ways
as the Robbers. For what we have said of Livonia is no less true of Muscovy, viz. that, in the
Winter time, they break open houses, and take away peoples Cattle, &c. as we have related
in the second Book of these our Travels. We could add many other stories of these Creatures,
but in regard, they would hardly, for the strangeness of them, be credited, at least by such
as never heard any talk of these things, we forbear. When the Muscovites take any of the
Bears Whelps, they tame them, and teach them a thousand tricks, and, in time, come to get
a livelihood by them.
                  The Lakes,No Carps in Muscovy. Ponds and Rivers affords all sorts of Fish, Carps excepted, which are not to
be had either in Muscovy or Livonia. At Astrachan, we met with abundance of them,
very large, but tough and unsavory; which is the reason the Muscovites make no great accompt
of them.
                  Heretofore there were no Mines in Muscovy,Mines. but some years since there was one found out
near Tula, upon the Frontiers of Tartary, 120 leagues from Mosco, which affords only Iron,
where the Workmen are such as the Elector of Saxony sent over to the Great Duke. Peter
Marcellis, a Merchant, born at Hamborough hath the management of it, who having
built a Forge in a very pleasant Valley there, which hath a Brook running through it, hath
taken it of the Great Duke, furnishing him every year with a certain number of Iron Bars, pieces
of Artillery and Bullets. About 15 year since, information was brought to the Great
Duke Michael Federouits, that Gold might be found in a certain Province in Muscovy, if any
would be at the expence to dig for it; but he who brought the first news of it, instead of enriching
himself, was utterly undone. Heretofore the Muscovites were simple enough to credit
these informations, and to advance money upon the propositions that were made thereupon;
but for some years past, they have been content to hearken to them; or if they advance
any money, it is upon good security put in by the undertaker. I have seen an example of this in
an English Merchant, who was perswaded that Gold would infallibly be found, and upon that
imagination engag'd some of his friends to be answerable to the Great Duke for the money he
should advance. But, after a great expence, to no purpose, he was put in prison, and his friends
were forc'd to pay the mony he had taken up.
                  
                     
Having not seen the more Northerly Provinces of Muscovy, as Dwina, Iugarie, Permie,
Siberie, and Samojede, I should content my self with what I have said of them in the beginning
of this Book: But in regard this last named Province is absolutely unknown to all the rest of
Europe,Samojede. and that I have had the opportunity to discourse with some Samojedes, and to learn
from their own mouths the particularities of their Country, I hope it will not be thought much
if I make a short digression concerning them. Being at Moscou, in the year 1643. in the Great
Duke's Antichamber, or Posolse-Pricas, staying till a Persian Ambassador were come out from
Audience, that I might go in to have mine, I had the convenience to discourse with two Deputies
of the Samojedes, who had been sent to the Great Duke with a present of many Elks, and
white Bear-skins, which the Muscovian Lords use to adorn their Sledges. I laid hold on this
occasion to enquire of them some part of what I was desirous to know concerning their manner
of life; which I did with the more ease, in that both of them understood the Muscovian
Language.
                  'Tis certain, these people were antiently comprehended under the name of those whom they
called Schites, and Sarmates, and that they were not called Samojedes, till after they became
Subjects to the Great Duke: for that word is Muscovian, signifying Eaters of themselves, as
being compounded of that of Sam, himself, and Geda, I eat. They would argue thence, that
these people are Anthropophagi; for indeed, they did feed on mans flesh, even that of their deceas'd
friends, which they mixt with Venison, which was, and is still their ordinary nourishment.The difference between Samojede and Samogitia.
What we have said discovers the difference there is between this Province and that of Samogitia,
which the Muscovites call Samotska sembla, situated between Lithuania and Livonia,
and is part of the Kingdom of Poland; whereas Samojede lies towards the Hyperborean Mountains,
on both sides of the River Oby, upon the Tartarian Sea, and towards the streight of
Weigats, as we said before. I can hardly be perswaded, that it is of the Samojedes, Quintus
Curtius would speak, when he sayes that the Abii sent their Ambassadors to Alexander the
Great, and that instead of Abii we should read Obii, because they liv'd upon the River Oby;
but of the Tartars, who are near the River Don, or Tanais, which divides Asia from Europe.
'Tis of them rather than of the Samojedes, that Q. Curtius might affirm, that they had no Cities,
nor setled Habitations, but liv'd in Woods and Desarts, shunning the conversation of men,
and that if Alexander went thither, he must have Conquer'd impenetrable Forests, Rivers, Ice,
and Snow,The habitations of the Samojedes after he had triumphed over the Inhabitants. For though the Samojedes have indeed
no Cities, yet are they not Nomades, nor change their habitations as the Tartars do. On the
contrary, their Cabans or Huts, which are covered vault-wife, are built half under-ground, and
have in the middle a hole, which does not only serve for a Chimney, but also for a door when
the Snow is so high, that they are forc'd to make use of that hole to let in air; Since that the
Countrey being in the Frigid Zone, the Snow, which is there sometimes the depth of a Pike,
makes their doors useless. They have walks under their Huts, by the means whereof they may
visit and converse one with another. And this kind of life is so much the more supportable to
them, for that the Sun going beyond the Line, and leaving them in continual darkness for six
moneths together, the liberty they might have to go abroad would be of no advantage to them.
During this long night, they have no other light than what their Lamps afford them, which is
but a sad and melancholy one, as being maintain'd by the Oyl of a certain fish, of which they
make provision in the Summer. Which Season begins with them, as soon as the Sun comes to
the Aequinoctial line, and, entring into the Septentrional Signs of the Zodiack, melts the
Snow, and brings them a day as long as the night had been tedious. Upon this accompt it is,
that Olaus Magnus, Alexander Guagnin, and others, have grounded fables of people that
sleep six moneths of the year, or, as Swallows, and Frogs, die in the beginning of Winter,
and rise up again in the Spring. They do not cultivate the Earth, nor keep any Cattel, which
is, no doubt, because the Earth would not require their pains, and affords no Grass. So that
having no Corn,Their nourishment. they have no bread to make; and having no Wool, they are forc'd to Cloath
themselves with what nature and their Countrey can afford them. Their food is fish, dry'd in
the Wind and Sun, Honey and Venison. They are of low stature, their faces large and flat,
wearing their hair very long; they have little eyes, and short legs, and are not much unlike the
Groenlanders, of whom we shall have somewhat to say anon.
                  The Cloathing of the Samojedes is of Renes skins,Their cloathing. whereof there are abundance in that
Countrey, as indeed there is all over the North. This Creature, which is thought to be
the Tarandius of the Antients, is called by the modern Latines Rangifer, from the word Reen,
by which name the Laplanders call it, a beast not known in these parts. 'Tis as big as a Stag,
but somewhat stronger, the hair grey or white, as they are in Samojede, having the breast high
with a long and rough hair, the hoof cloven, and the horn so hard, that making an impression
in the Ice, this animal goes as securely as if it were upon the ground, and so swiftly, that it will
run above 30. German leagues in a day. The horns are higher than those of the Elk, and larger
than a Stag's, having two brow-anklers on the forehead, wherewith he breaks the Ice to
get water in Winter. 'Tis a sociable beast, feeding in herds. It is tam'd without any trouble,

and is very serviceable, especially in travelling, being set before little Sledges, made like a
Boat, which they draw with incredible force and swiftness.
                  The Samojedes wear very large Caps, made of fur, or pieces of Cloath of several colours,
which they buy of the Muscovites, and are so big that they fall down to their necks. Their
shirts are made of the skins of young Renes, which are very soft, and have a short hair. They
wear drawers under their shirts, and upon their shirts, Garments falling down to the mid-leg,
border'd below with a very long fur. These Garments are made like those which are called Cosaques,
open only at the neck. Their Mittens are fasten'd to the end of their sleeves, and the
fur of all their Cloaths is turn'd on the out-side. When the cold is extraordinary, they put
their Cosaques over their heads, and let the sleeves hang down, their faces being not to be seen,
but at the cleft which is at the neck.The error of certain Geographers. Whence some have taken occasion to write, that in these
Northern Countreys, there are people without heads, having their faces in their breasts. As
also that there are some have feet so big, that one of them shades the whole body, and that having
cover'd themselves with their feet, neither Sun nor Rain can come at them. But the errour
came thus, that the Samojedes, as also the Laplanders and Finlanders, wear a kind of
shooes or patins, in the Winter time, to go upon the Snow, which are an Ell and a half long
towards the Toe. The Finlanders and Laplanders make them as long towards the Heel as the
Toes, and call them Saksit; but the Samojedes do not lengthen them at all towards the heel, and
call them Nartes. All make them of barks of Trees, or some very thin Wood, and use them
with a strange agility. Colonel Port, Governour of Narva, who had many Finlanders among
the Soldiers of his Garrison, would needs give us the pleasure of seeing them, when we pass'd
that way, having order'd them to run down a Hill near the City, which they did with such swiftness,
that a horse at full speed would hardly have overtaken them.
                  The Nerves and Veins of the Rene serve for Thread, among the Samojedes, to sow their
Cloaths; their Boots they make of the same stuff, and after the same manner. They scrape the
in-side of the bark of Beech, and what comes off is as fine as the shavings of Parchment or Ivory,
and very soft, and serves them instead of Handkerchers. They take a handful of it, and wipe
their hands, faces, or noses therewith.
                  The Relations of the second Voyage which the Hollanders made towards the North, in the
year 1595. give the same account of the Samojedes as we do, and say, that some of their men
going ashore Aug. 31. near Weigats, after they had gone about a league, discover'd 20. or 25.
Samojedes, so accoutred as we have describ'd them. They at first took them for Savages, and
were confirm'd in that opinion by the posture into which the Samojedes put themselves, making
ready their Bows and Arrows, to shoot at the Hollanders: but the Muscovian Interpreter,
which the Hollanders had with them, having told them they were friends, and that they needed
not to be afraid of them, they laid down their Arms, came up to them, and discover'd many
particulars of their Country. They were much taken with the civility of the Hollanders, and
one of them took a Biket that was presented to him; but he betray'd much distrust in the eating
of it; especially, when they heard a Musket shot, towards the Sea-side, though far enough
from them, they were so frightned, that it was no easie matter to satisfie them, that they
were far enough from any danger.
                  I had the curiosity to ask one of those Samojedes, what he thought of Muscovy, and whether
it were a better Country than theirs, and the Muscovian manner of Life, the more pleasant.
He answer'd, that Muscovy was indeed a pleasant Country, and the provisions of it not
to be disliked; but that their Country also had those conveniences and pleasures, that were
not to be had elsewhere, such as were so inviting, that he was confident, if the Great Duke
had once a tast of them, he would leave Moscou, and come among them, to enjoy the security,
quiet, and delightfulness of their manner of life. They were, till within these few years, Pagans
and Idolaters, insomuch as when the Hollanders made the Voyage I spoke of there, they
found the Sea-side  of Idols, for which the Samojedes had so much affection, that they would
not suffer one of them to be carried away. But they have been since baptized, and have embrac'd
Christian Religion, by the means of a Bishop of Vladimer which the late Great Duke
sent among them, with some Priests, to instruct them.
                  The Author,A description of Groenland who hath here made one digression, to speak of the Samojedes, though not falling
under the Subject of his Travels, thinks he may make another to say somewhat of Groenland,
as well in regard of the consonancy there is between the people of that Country and those
he had now spoken of, and also the Tartars, of whom he will have occsion to speak hereafter,
as for that he hath seen, and discoursed with, some Inhabitants of Groenland, who have told
such particularities, as would not be undelightful, if M. de la Pcreire had not said before himall
that could be said of a Country, which is as little known, as those parts of the World that
have not yet been discover'd. The Treatise he hath publish'd upon this Subject is such, that
we shall not need to repeat what he hath clearly and elegantly express'd, but only add, together
with the opinion of our Author, (who thinks Groenland is a Continent, and borders upon
Tartary towards the East on one side, and on America, Westward, on the other.) That

Frederick III. King of Denmark, coming to the Crown, in the year 1648. had, besides all other
Royal Vertues, a great desire to advance the Trade of Groenland. Henry Muller, Farmer
General of the outland customs of Denmark, a curious person and rich, undertook it, and,
to that end, set out a Ship in the year 1652. commanded by Capt. David Dannel, one of the
most experienc'd Masters of his time. The first Voyage having had the success was expected
from it, the said Muller sent him again to Groenland the next year, 1653. But as men of business,
how curious soever they may be, are carried away with some other predominant passion,
there was nothing learnt in these two Voyages, at least those employ'd in them neglected to
make any relation thereof that ever could be seen: but in the year 1654. a Ship was set out,
which going from Copenhagen in the beginning of the Spring, arriv'd not on the Coasts of
Groenland, till the 28 of Iuly, at a place where the mountains were still cover'd with snow,
towards the shore the waters frozen, and the bottom so hard, that it being impossible the Anchor
should fasten, they were forc'd to let the Ship float upon the water, because there were
Rocks all about. As soon as this Ship appear'd upon the Coasts of Groenland, the Inhabitants
set out above a hundred Boats, and came to view that strange structure, which was much different
from what they ordinarily saw. At first they would by no means come near it, but seeing
they were intreated to come into the Ship, they at last came, and in a few days were so
familiar, that with their commodities, which they truckt for such toies as we had, they
brought also their Wives, out of an intention to make advantage of them by another kind of
Commerce, which though it be not less known elsewhere, yet is not so publickly practis'd as
among them, where fornication is neither crime nor sin.
                  The Danes thought this freedom of the Groenlanders a good opportunity to carry away some
of them. The Ship being ready to set sail for its return, and the Savages coming still aboard
with their Commodities, a VVoman that had a great mind to a pair of knives which one of the
Sea-men wore at his Grde, offer'd him for it a Sea-Dogs skin, which the Sea-man refusing
as too little, she proffer'd him a kindness into the bargain. The Sea-man had no sooner express'd
his being well satisfy'd with the proffer, but she begins to unty the point (for they as
well as the men wear Drawers, and would have laid her self down upon the Deck. But the Sea-man
made her apprehend that he would not have all see what they did, and that she must go under
Deck. The Woman, having got her Father's leave, follow'd the Sea-man with two other
aged Women, a young Boy, and a Girl of about 12 years of age, who were to be present at
the consummation of the bargain. But as soon as they were down, the hatch was shut, they
laid hold also of another Man, and set sail. The Savages perceiving they were trappan'd, made
a hideous noise in the Ship. Those who were upon the Deck got into their Boats, and follow'd
the Ship a great way into the Sea, to see if they could recover the Prisoners. The Boy,
who went down with the Women; got out at one of the holes the Cable is put out at, and
swam ashore. They also sent back one of the Women, as being too old to be transported; so
that they had but four persons, one Man, two Women, and a Girl. The trouble they were in
to be among people they knew not, was extraordinary; but at last, the kindness and good
cheer wherewith they were entertain'd, won their hearts, together with the hope they were
put into, that within a short time, they should be brought back again into their Country: so
that when they came to Bergues in Norway, their affliction seem'd to be quite over, nay, the
Man thought the Women of the Country so handsome, and was got into so good a humour,
that, a Lady of quality being come out of curiosity to see these Savages, he proffer'd to try
what she had under her apron. This man dy'd in the Ship before we came to Denmark. His
Daughter seeing him in the agony of Death, bound up his head in his Casaque, and so let him
dy. His name was Ihiob, aged about 40 years. The older of the two women, aged about
45 years, was called Kuneling; she by whose means they were taken, was about 25. her name
Kabelau, and the Girls name was Sigoka. The Plague then very rife all over Denmark, had oblig'd
the King to retire to Flensbourg, in the Dutchy of Holstein, where these Groenlanders were
presented to him. He boarded them at a Chirurgeons, and order'd them to be well entertain'd,
as that at their return to Groenland, whither he intended to send them with the first opportunity,
they might have occasion to celebrate the liberality of his Majesty, and the civil entertainment
of his Subjects. The King honour'd the Duke my master so far, as to send them to him to Gottorp,
where they were lodg'd in my house for some days, which I spent in sifting our their humour
and manner of life.
                  They were all three low of stature,Of the Inhabitants. but strong, being well proportion'd in all parts, save
that their faces were somewhat too broad, and their eyes little, but black and very lively, especially
the more aged of the two women and the Girl, their hands and feet short, in all things
else like the Samojedes, or Tartars of Nagaia, save that they were beyond comparison much
more black, those being of a brown Olive-like colour, their bodies much more swarthy than
their faces, and their skins much softer than those other people we have spoken of. The third
whose name was Kabelau, was not so black as the two others. Her eyes were also bigger, and
she discover'd more wit, subtilty, and compliance, than the other two. We conceived she

might be descended of those antient Christians, who some time lived in Groenland, in that she
was observ'd to have somewhat of Religion in her, or rather a particular Superstition, by the
aversion she had for flesh, which the other two did eat, such as that of those Beasts, which, being
held unclean, are not eaten in Europe. Their hair was blacker than Jet, and having roll'd
it up together they bound it up on their crowns. As soon as their Maids become marriageable,
they make several blew strakes in their faces, as the Americans do. These strakes reach from
the lip to the chin, or they are drawn larger at the upper end and above the nose, between the
two eyes; nay there is one divides it self and reaches over the eye-brows into the Temples,
where it ends with a little branch. These marks they make with a very small thread steep'd in
Train-oil,
or some other black fatness, which being brought between the flesh and the skin,
leaves a mark, which through the skin seems blewish, much like the veins in a smooth and delicate
complexion. They shew'd me that their ears had been holed through, and that they were
wont to wear Pendants in them. Their breasts were very unhandsome, the nipple black as a coal,
and the Breasts flagging and falling down upon their bellies, wherein the Girl had no advantage
of the other two. They suckle their Children, whom they carry on their backs, over their
shoulders. I have been told by those who have long observ'd them, that they have no hair any
where but on their heads, and are not troubled with womens monthly diseases.
                  The Groenlanders speak fast,Their language. and from the throat, somewhat like the Tartars, especially they
they pronounce very roughly the words that have a G. in them. They have no R. in their language,
and when they are oblig'd to pronounce it, they turn into L. 'Tis true, among so
many words as their language consists of, there are some Danish, but very few; the rest have
nothing common with the languages that are either spoken, or learnt, or known in Europe;
unless it might be said that the word Keiling comes from coelum, ilioun, from the Greek ,
as signifying the same thing. It may be said also that the word Igne is Latiue, but among all the
rest, we shall hardly meet with three or four that any way relate to any other language. And
to the end the Reader may himself judge, we will furnish him with some of those which are most
common in ordinary conversation.

                  The Groenlanders call those of their Countrey Inguin,Their cloathing. and strangers Kablunassouin, and Cloath
themselves with the skins of Sea-dogs, and Sea-calves, and Renes, much like the Samojedes.
They wear under their Cloaths Wastcoats, of the skins of birds, as Swans, Geese, wild Ducks,
and Teals, turning the feathers either inward or outward according to the seasons. The difference
of Sex is not easily discover'd, unless it be that the Women are known by a piece of skin
that hangs down before and behind to the half-leg, and by the capuche of their Wastcoats,
which is made like that of the Recollects, and large enough to hide their hair, whereas that of
the men is narrower, and cut like that of the Franciscans. The mens breeches come down to
their knees, and sometimes lower; but those of the women are shorter, and hardly cover half
the Thigh.
                  They live by hunting and fishing,Their ordinary exercises. and make use, in these two exercises, only of Bows and
Arrows, which are the only Arms they have. They have also a kind of hook, which they call
Karlusa, made of the tooth of the fish Towak, which some would have thought the Unicorn's
horn. Of this bone they make also the instrument they use in Whale-fishing, at which they are
very expert, taking that Creature much after another manner than is done by the Biskayans,
and others who drive that trade. To that end, they have a very long thong, cut out of a Whale's
skin, and fasten to one end of it the said instrument, which they cast at the Whale, and at the
other the skin of a Sea-Calf or Dog blown up, which floating upon the water, discovers the
track of the wounded Whale. If she be not mortally wounded, they pursue her, and Dart two
or three times more at her, with the same kind of instrument, till such time as bloud and
strength failing her, they come up, kill her, bring her ashore, and divide her. The Whales fat
is one of their greatest dainties, but especially the Oyl, which is their best sawce, and the drink
they best love. Their ordinary drink is only water; the Women I have seen, would never
drink any Wine, nor eat of our bread, or sawces: for having no Salt, Spice, Sugar, nor Vinegar
in their Countrey, it is not to be wondred that we could not bring them to like meats
dress'd after our way. Yet do they not eat their meat raw, as some would perswade, but
dress'd, either by boyling or roasting. 'Tis true, they love dry'd Haberdine, or Stockfish, and
sometimes eat it raw; but that is not extraordinary even in Germany, where I have seen, at a
desert at the Duke of Wolfembuttel's, Gammons of Bacon, and dry'd Salmon serv'd up unboyl'd.
Their ordinary food, are Sea-Dogs, and Calves, Renes, Foxes, Hous-Dogs, and Fish.
When they eat, with one hand, they put a piece of the flesh into their mouths, and with the
other cut off what they cannot get in, so that the bits being as much as their mouths can hold,
they make very strange faces to get it down.
                  Their way of living is so different from what is seen elsewhere,They are Savages. that it is no injury to call them
Savages. They have no discretion, civility, vertue, or shame. Their countenances are ever
frowning, and they very seldom laugh: they are timerous and distrustful, and withall insolent,
stubborn, and indisciplinable. They are very nasty, and their Tongues serve them for Handkerchers,
as well for their Cloaths as their Bodies, so that they may very justly be said to live
like beasts. Which yet admits of some distinction, according to the situation of several parts of
the Countrey, it being certain, that the English Pilot, who went from Denmark, with Godtske
Lindenau, of whom Mr. Pereire makes mention, and who took his course more towards the
South-west, met with a people much more docile, and less Savage, than that which Lindenau
met withall towards the North. Our three women, who had been taken at the entrance of
Davis-streight, were rational enough, and easily learnt what they were taught. One of them
imitated pretty well a head or hand, I was drawing with a piece of Charcoal, and the other
came in a short time to do those things, which women and maids ordinarily employ themselves

about in our parts. They danc'd after a strange manner, but with such exactness as to time and
cadence, that the King of Denmark, having a Ball danc'd at Flensbourg, would needs bring in
those three Groenlanders, who came off very hansomly, to the satisfaction of all: But they
would never be got to learn our language, though they pronounc'd the Danish and German
words dictated to them very distinctly.
                  There is no money in the Country,The Groenlanders have no Gold nor Silver in their Countrey. being yet so happy as not to know the value of Gold and
Silver. Iron and Steel they most esteem, and prefer a Sword or a Hatchet before a Golden Cup,
a Nail before a Crown piece, and a pair of Cisers, or a Knife, before a Jacobus. Their trucking
is thus; they put all they have to sell together, and having pick'd out among the Commodities
that are brought to them, what they like best, they put them also together, and suffer those they
deal with to add or diminish till such time as they are content with the bargain. What they
most value, are Knives, Cisers, Needles, Looking-glasses, Iron and Steel; and the Commodities
they sell are the fat and Oyl of Whales, the skins of Sea-dogs and Calves, the Horns, or
rather the Teeth of the Fish Towak, whereof Mr. Pereire makes a large and true description, in
his Treatise of Groenland. It is granted, to be an excellent Antidote against poyson, but it is
long since men have been undeceiv'd in the opinion they had of it. The Duke of Holstein hath
one that is eight foot and two inches long, and weighs eighteen pound: but the King of Denmark's
is six inches longer. There is also in Groenland Talk, and Marble, white, and of all
other colours, and it hath been argu'd from the vapours which were seen rising out of the earth,
at the place where the English Pilot came ashore, that there are Mines of Sulphur. It is reported
also, that in the time of Frederick II. King of Denmark, some Oar was brought thence,
whereof the hundred weight yielded twenty six Ounces of Silver; which is the more credible,
in that it is certain, the more Northerly parts of the Countrey produce both Gold and Silver,
since there hath been seen at the King of Denmark's, a Wedge of Silver of sixty Marks, which
had been taken out of the Mines of Norway.
                  Of the Groenland Religion,Are Pagans. I must confess I could never have any accompt; but it is most
likely they are Pagans and Idolaters, for we have in our custody an Idol, which we bought out
of the Study of Doctor Paludanus, a Physician at Enck-huysen, who had fasten'd a Note to it,
expressing it's being found at Davis-streight. And indeed, our Groenland women presently knew it
and called it Nalim-qui-sang. 'Twas very roughly made, of a piece of Wood a foot and a half
long, cover'd with Feathers and a hairy skin, having about the neck Sea-dogs Teeth. The women
would make me understand, that the Children were wont to dance about those Idols; and
our Groenland women were seen in fair mornings to prostrate themselves and weep, at sun-rising;
whence it is to be inferr'd, that those people adore the Sun. Zeiler, in his Itinerary, says, that
the Groenlanders are for the most part Sorcerers, and sell Winds, as the Laplanders do:
but that's more than the Danes have observ'd in their Voyages. Only it was noted among those
that were in Denmark, that when any of them fell sick, one of the Camerades lay down upon
his back by him, and the sick person sitting up bound about his head who ail'd nothing, putting
a stick between the forehead and the cloath that bound it, the other raising up his head, so as
that the sick person might, at first, think it light, afterwards heavy, pronouncing and muttering
certain words. After which he begun again, and he who had his head bound up, leaned it
down very heavy at first, afterwards more lightly, the sick person still continuing his prayers
and imprecations; none being able to guess at the mystery of this Ceremony. They have neither
Magistrate nor Superiour among them; their condition is equal in all things, only he that
hath most Children, most Bows and Arrows, and kills most Wildfowl, is the richest and most
considerable among them.
                  For the colour of these people,Inhabitants of Septentrional Countries swarthy. it might be admir'd that in the coldest Climate in the World,
the Men should be of an Olive-colour, or rather swarthy, if whatLib. 2. c. 78. Pliny saies be true, that it
is the heat of the Sun that burns the skin, and makes the hair curl, and that cold whitens the
skin, and makes the hair of an Ash-colour. But we find the contrary by experience, not only
in the people we have spoken of, but also in those who live at the Magellan Streight, who are
white, though as near the Sun as the Negroes of Africk. The Inhabitants about the Cape of
good Hope, are black, and yet the Spaniards and Italians, as also the Persians, who are in the
same degree, are white. The Ethiopians are but of a duskish colour, and the Malabares and Inhabitants
of the Isle of Cedon, who are equally distant from the Line, are black. In like manner,
all over America, there are no Blacks, but only at Quaerca, though that vast part of the Universe
reaches from one Circle to the other, through all the Climates of the World. 'Tis no
more than conjecture to say, that this diversity of colours proceeds from certain qualities of the
Country and Air, whereof the causes are not known. Nor is there any more certainly to affirm,
that that colour in the skin proceeds from the constitution of the body, since that in any
Climate whatsoever, the conjunction of a Black Man and White Woman shall produce a swarthy
Child, or of such a colour as the Spaniards call Mulatas; which is so much the more probable,
in that the Sun does not alwayes blacken, but on the contrary, whitens some things, as
Wax and Linne: it being also known, that the Sun makes a picture look more lightsome, and

that the Portuguez expose their hair thereto, to take off somewhat of their dy. But to give a
more Christian accompt thereof, it may be said, with the Learned Mr. Bochart, in his incomparable
Phaleg; That the black colour is a mark of the curse in the posterity of Cham, which
spread it self in these places of Asia and Africa where the Negroes live.
                  But it is time we return to our Muscovites, whom we shall consider, first, in relation to their
habit and stature, then to that of their humour and manner of life.
                  They are for the most part corpulent, fat, and strong, and of the same colour as other Europaeans.The stature of the Muscovites.
They much esteem great beards (when the mustaches hide the mouth) as also great
bellies; so that those who are well furnish'd about the mouth, and have good fat paunches, are
very considerable among them. The Goses, or Great Duke's Merchants, whom we found in
the Antichamber, when we were brought to our publick Audience, had been chosen particularly
for those two perfections, for the greater honour of their Prince.
                  The great Lords shave their heads; persons of lower condition cut their hair, and Priests, and
others belonging to the Church, wear their hair so long, that it hangs down over their shoulders
to half their backs. Those Lords that are out of favour at Court, let their hair grow and
hang negligently about their heads, thereby expressing their affliction; no doubt after
the example of the antient Greeks, whom the Muscovites are apt to imitate in all their
actions.
                  The Women are well proportion'd, neither too big, nor too little; having passable good faces,The Women paint.
but they paint so palpably, that if they laid it on with a brush, and had a handful of meal
cast in their faces when they had done, they could not disfigure themselves as much as the paint
does. But the custom is so general, that the most handsome must comply, lest they should
discred it the artificial beauty of others: whereof we saw an example in the wife of Knez Iuan
Borissowits Cirkaski, who was the handsomest Lady of all Muscovy, and was loath to spoil with
painting, what the rest of her Sex took so much pains to preserve thereby: but the other Women
inform'd against her, and would not be quiet, till their husbands had forc'd that Prince to
give way that his wife might dawb her face after the ordinary manner. So that painting is so
common in Muscovy, that when any are to be married, the Bridegroom, that is to be, sends
among other Presents some paint to his Bride, as we shall see anon when we come to speak of
their marriages.
                  Married Women put up their hair within their Caps or Coifs,Their habit but the Maids let their;
hang down their backs in two tresses, and tye it at the ends with a piece of Crimsonsilk.
Children under 10 years of age, as well Girls as Boys, have their hair cut, all except
two mustaches which are left over the temples; so that there being no difference in their habits,
that of their Sex is discovered only by the brass or silver Rings, which the Girls wear in their
ears.
                  Their habit is somewhat like that of the antient Greeks. Their shirts are broad, but so short
that they hardly cover the thighs. They are not gather'd at the neck, but lin'd with a triangular
piece from the shoulders to the reins, which piece is sow'd down with Crimson silk. Some have under
the Armpits, and in the seams, a fringe of silk of the same colour. The more rich have the neckpiece,
which is an inch broad or better, the end of the sleeves, and the breast, embroider'd with
silk of several colours, and sometimes Gold and precious stones, and leave open so much of their
Wast-coats, that the embroidery and the two great Pearls, or buttons of Silver or Gold, which
fasten the shirt before, may be seen. Their Breeches are large, and gather'd towards the waste,
so that they may be made larger or streightned, as our Drawers. Upon these they wear a kind
of VVastcoat, which they call Kaftan, reaching to the knees, with the sleeves so long, that
they cannot thrust their hands through without making many folds upon the arm. The Collar
of this Wastcoat is above half a quarter both in height and bredth, so that it covers the head
behind. And because that is very much seen, the better sort face it with Plush or Satin. Upon
the Kaftan they wear a close Coat, which falls down to the mid-leg, and is called Feres. These
are adorn'd with cotton; and indeed, both the Kaftas and Feres are made of Cotton, Taffeta,
Damask, or Satin, according to their quality who wear them. VVhen they go abroad they
put on a Garment that reaches down to their heels, made of a violet colour, or dark green
cloath, with buttons behind, down to the bottom. Those of the Knez and Bojares are made
of Damask, Satin, or other rich stuff. Of this last kind are all the cloaths taken out of the
Great Duke's VVardrobe, for those persons by whom he is attended at publick ceremonies.
                  Their Feres, or Hongrelines, or close Coats, have a very broad Collar, falling down upon
their shoulders, with loop-buttons of Gold and Silver, nay some with embroidery at the open
places before, and the sides. The sleeves are as long as the Coat it self, but narrow; so
that when it is on, they hang down, and have this convenience that they serve to hide a
cudgel, or stones, wherewith they many times surprize and kill those, whom they intend
to rob.
                  All Muscovites wear Caps instead of Hats. The Knez, Bojares, and Ministers of State,

have them of black-Fox skins, or Sables, half an ell high, when they are present at any publick
Ceremonies; but in their houses, and about the City, they are of Velvet, lined with the said
Furrs, but with narrow brims, layd all over with buttons and loops of Gold and Silver, or
embroider'd with Pearls, The common People, in the Summer time, wear Caps of some coarse
stuff, and in-Winter, of cloath, lin'd with Sheep skins, or some ordinary Furr. Their boots
are short, as those of the Polanders, and picked towards the toe, and are made of Russia Leather,
or Goats skin brought from Persia, They have not yet the art of dressing Spanish Leather,
nor the invention of tranning Ox-hides, otherwise than the soles. The Womens shooes are half
a quarter high at the heel, set on with little nails, in so much that they can hardly go in
them.
                  The Muscovian Women are habited much after the same fashion as the Men, save that their
Hongrelines, or Coats, are wider, and of the same stuff as their Wastcoats. The richer sort
have them layd over very thick with Gold, Silver, or Silk-Lace, and have buttons and loops of
the same stuff, or great buttons of Silver or Tinn; to fasten them. The sleeves are so put on, as
that they may thrust their hands into them, or let them hang down. They wear no Kaftans;
much less use those high collars, which are thought so ornamental for the Men. Their Smock
sleeves are four or five ells long, and are set in little folds upon the arm. They wear very wide
Caps or Coifs of Damask, plain or purfled Satin, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and lined
with Castors, the hair whereof does in a manner cover all their forehead. Maids that are marriageable
wear cloath Caps, lined with Fox-skin.
                  It is not long since, that strangers, whether Physicians, or Merchants, as the French, English,
Hollanders and Germans, went in Muscovian habits, to avoid the insolence of the people,
who many times took occasion to affront them, out of no other reason than the diversity of their
cloaths. But the present Patriarch, having observ'd in a Procession, that the Germans who had
thrust in among the Muscovites to see it pass by, betraid a certain irreverence at their Ceremonies,
especially at the Benediction he gave the people, was incens'd thereat, and said, that those
strangers, being not worthy to participate of the Benediction which was given to the faithful, it
were fit the Great Duke put out an Ordinance, obliging strangers to cloath themselves according
to the fashions of their own Countries. The contempt of any Law is severely punish'd in Muscovy:
but the observation of this was so much the more difficult, in that, for want of Taylors,
it was almost impossible for people to get other cloaths within the time limited by the Ordinance.
Yet were they forc'd to obey, which occasion'd very good sport, in that those who
were servants to the Great Duke, being oblig'd to be every day at the Court, and not daring to
appear there in Muscovian habits, they were forc'd to put on what they could meet withall, and
to make use of those cloaths which their Grand-fathers, and Great-grand-fathers had worn,
when the Tyrant Iohn Basilouits forc'd them out of Livonia, to go and live at Moscou.
'Twas a strange sight to see them all in cloaths that were either too big, or too little, as having
not been made for them, besides that there was no acquaintance at all between Breeches and
Doublet, or any correspondence between the age wherein they had been made, and that they
were then worn in. Ever since that time every Nation is clad according to their own modes.
                  The Muscovites never change their fashion, nor can I remember any more than one Lord,
who took a fancy to the French mode. His name is Knez Mikita Iouanouits Romanou, very
rich, and of near kin to the Great Duke, who is much taken with his humour and conversation.
This Lord hath a particular affection for Strangers, and goes in the French and Polish modes in
his cloaths, especially when he goes either into the Country or a-hunting. But the Patriarch,
who dislik'd that feedom in him, and was displeased also with another, which that Prince took,
to speak somewhat slightly of their Religion, enjoy'd him not to speak any further of Religion.
Nothing so wretched as the cloathing of the Country people. It is of a very coarse Canvase,
and their shooes of barks of trees, which they have the art to sow and interlace like paniers,
with a miraculous industry. There is hardly any Muscovite but is good at this Trade,
and does exercise it; so that it may be said, Muscovy hath as many Shoomakers as men, or at
least, that there is no Family, but hath its particular Shooemaker. It is upon the same accompt
said of the Elector of Brandenburg, that he hath a Baylywick in the Dutchy of Prussia, which is
that of Insterbourg, where there are above 15000. shooemakers, for all the Peasants of that
Baylywick make their own shooes.
                  If a man consider the natures and manner of life of the Muscovites,Their manner of life. he will be forc'd to
avow, there cannot any thing be more barbarous than that people. Their boast is that they are
desended from the antient Greeks, but, to do them no injustice, there is no more comparison
between the brutality of these Barbarians, and the civility of the Greeks, to whom all other
parts of the VVorld are oblig'd for all their literature and civilization, than there is between
day and night. They never learn any Art or Science, nor apply themselves to any kind of Study:
on the contrary, they are so ignorant, as to think, a man cannot make an Almanack unless he
be a Sorcerer, nor foretell the Revolutions of the Moon and Eclipses, unless he have some communication
with Devils. Upon this accompt it was, that the Muscovites generally grumbled

when the Great Duke would have entertain'd me into his service, in the quality of his Astronomer
and Mathematician, as we return'd from our Voyage into Persia, and rais'd a report, that
their Prince was going to bring a Magician into his Court. This aversion I discover'd in the
Muscovites, took off that little inclination I sometime had to embrace that employment,
which was offer'd me, not so much upon the accompt of my abilities in Astronomy, as, to engage
me to continue in the Countrey, because they knew, that I had exactly observ'd, and
drawn into a Map the whole course of the River Wolga, whereof they were unwilling that
strangers should have any knowledge. When I came to Muscovy, upon the affairs of the Duke
of Holstein my Master, in the year 1643. I shew'd them upon a Wall of an obscure Chamber,
through a little hole I had made in the shutter of the window, by the means of a piece of glass
polish'd and cut for Opticks, all was done in the street, and men walking upon their heads:
This wrought such an effect in them, that they could never after be otherwise perswaded than
that I held a correspondence with the Devil.
                  They esteem Physicians, and Medicine, but will not permit that people should make use of
the same means as is done elsewhere to gain the perfection of that Science. They will not suffer
the body to be opened, that so the causes of diseases may be found out, and they have a strange
aversion for Skeletons There is to this purpose a pleasant story of a Dutch Surgeon who liv'd
at Moscou some years since. His name was Quirin, one much favour'd by the Great Duke,
because of his facetious humour, and his experience in the Art he profess'd. It happen'd one
day, that this good man diverting himself in his Chamber, and playing a Lesson on the Lute,
the Strelitz, who are spying up and down every where, drew near to the place where that
Musick was: but perceiving through a chink, a Skeleton hanging behind him, which the wind
coming in at the window caused to move, they were frightned, and reported, that the strange
Surgeon had a dead Carkass that mov'd at the sound of his Musick. The Great Duke and the
Patriarch desirous to be truly inform'd of the business, sent others to make a further discovery;
and these not only confirm'd what the others had reported, but added, that they had seen the
Skeleton dance, while the Surgeon play'd. The business was thought to be of such importance,
as that it were fit to be communicated to the Councel, where, nemine contradicente, it was declar'd,
That it was done by Magick. That, consequently, the Surgeon was a Magician, and
as such, ought to be burnt, together with the Skeleton. The Surgeon hearing of this sentence,
intreated a Merchant of his acquaintance, who had much credit at Court, to represent to Knez
Iuan Borissowits Cirkaski, that most Surgeons and Physicians in Germany make use of those Skeletons,
to find out the composure of the body, and juncture of the bones, that so they might
the better know how to cure what may happen in those parts. Upon this Lord's representation,
the former sentence was revers'd; but Quirin was forc'd to leave the Countrey, and the Skeleton
was dragg'd along the streets, and burnt on the other side of the River Moska. A German
Painter ran the same hazard about six years since. For the Strelits, who were got into his
house, with intent to pull it down, to hinder the Progress of a fire, which had already done
mischief enough, meeting with a dead man's skull, or death's head, would have cast both it
and the Master of the house into the fire, and had done it, if his friends had not deliver'd him
out of the hands of those Barbarians, and convinc'd them of the innocent use of that head, in
the art he profess'd.
                  'Tis true, The Muscovites do not want ingenuity, but they employ their wit so ill, that
not any of their actions is directed to vertue and the glory which ever attends it.They are ingenuous naturally. The Danish
Gentleman, who publish'd the Embassy be was sent upon, into Muscovy, from Frederick II.
gives the Muscovites a very true Character, in two Lines, when he says, That they are subtile,
over-reaching, humourous, self-will'd, obstinate, insolent, and impudent, that they
regulate their reason according to their power, and that they have shaken hands with all vertues,
to run themselves into all manner of vice.
                  Their industry and subtilty is chiefly seen in their Traffick, in which there is no craft or cheat
but they make use of, rather to circumvent others, than to prevent being deceiv'd themselves.
I wonder'd to see them sell Cloath at three Crowns and a half the Ell, which they had bought
of the English at four, and yet I was told they made a good profit thereby; for buying the
Cloath at a twelve months time for payment, and selling it for ready money, though at a lower
rate, they made use of the money, and employ'd it in other things, which brought in more
profit, than they would have made by selling the Cloath upon time, though they sold much
dearer than it cost them. They make a conscience to retain what is paid them more than their
due, and are so honest as to return what they have receiv'd by mistake: but they think it no
sin, in their dealings, to surprize those who Trade with them, giving this reason, that the
Merchant is to make his advantage of the Wit and industry God hath bestow'd on him, or never
meddle with Traffick. According to this principle, a certain Dutch Merchant having notoriously
over-reach'd several Muscovites, these Gentlemen were so far from being troubled at
it, that they spake of him, as of an excellent ingenuous man, and desir'd they might go partners
with him, out of a hope they conceiv'd, that he would discover some great secret to them.
                  
                     
And whereas cheating cannot be exercis'd without treachery, lying, and distrust, which are
its constant attendants, they are marvellously well vers'd in these qualities, as also in the Lectures
of Calumny,Are lyars and distrustful. which they commonly make use of against those on whom they would be
revenged for theft, which among them is the most enormous of all Crimes, and the most severely
punish'd. To this end, they are so cunning, as to pawn at, or get secretly convey'd
into their Lodgings, whom they would accuse, those things which they would have believed
were stollen from them, or they thrust them into their Enemies Boots; for in them the Muscovites
commonly carry their money and Letters. To make some provision against these abuses,
the Great Duke made an Edict in the year 1634. enjoyning that for the future, all Promises or
Obligations, whether for borrowing of money or pawning; though it were between Father
and Son, should be set down in writing and sign'd by both parties, else the debt to be lost. Heretofoe,
especially in the Reign of the Tyrant Iohn Basilouits, there needed no more to procure
a man's death or banishment, than to accuse him of High-Treason, without any Process, Evidence,
or Defence allow'd, all that were charged being punish'd, without any distinction
of Sex, Age, or Quality. Calumnies, and false suggestions were so common under that
Prince, that many strangers, even publick persons, many times fell into those misfortunes,
the Tyrant never regarding their Character as Ambassadors, nor that of the Princes by whom
they were sent. He banish'd, into Siberia, the Emperours Ambassadour, and caus'd him to
be so ill-treated, that the poor man resolv'd at last to change his Religion, hoping by his Apostacy
to alleviate his misery. The Great Duke Michael Federouits, shew'd no more respect
for the late King of France, when he sent the Marquesse of Exiducil into Siberia, where,
by the Artifices of his Collegue, Iames Roussel, he was a Prisoner 3 years, as we have mentioned
elsewhere.
                  To this purpose,A pleasant story. Martin Baar, Pastor of Narva, who liv'd at Moscou under the reign of
the Great Duke Boris Gudenou, told us this story. The Great Duke being troubled with the
Gout caus'd to be proclaim'd, that whoever could give him any ease should have very great rewards.
The wife of a certain Bojare, exasperated by the ill usage she had receiv'd from her
husband, went and inform'd, that the Bojare had an excellent remedy for the Gout; but had
so little affection for his Majesty, that he would not communicate it. They sent for the man,
who was not a little astonish'd when he understood the cause of his disgrace; but what excuses
soever he made, all was attributed to his malice. He was whipp'd, even to bloud, and cast in
Prison, where he could not forbear breaking out into passion, and saying, that he saw well
enough it was his wife had put that trick upon him, and that he would be reveng'd on her. The
Great Duke imagining these menaces proceeded from the trouble it was to him that his wife had
revealed what he would have kept secret, ordered him to be whipp'd more cruelly than the time
before, and sent one to tell him, that if he did not apply his remedy, he should prepare himself
for present death. The poor fellow perceiving his destruction unavoidable, said at last, that he
knew indeed a remedy, but doubting of its certainty, he durst not try it on his Majesty; yet if
they would allow him fifteen dayes to prepare it, he would apply it. Having that time granted
him, he sent to Czirback, two dayes journey from Moscou, upon the River Occa, whence
he had brought him a Wagon full of all sorts of Herbs, good and bad, and therewith prepar'd a
Bath for the Great Duke, who thereupon grew somewhat better. For whether it were that the
Disease was declining, or that among so many Herbs of all sorts, there were some good for his
Disease, he had some ease. Then were they confirm'd in the opinion they had before, that the
Bojares denyal to apply his remedy proceeded from his malice, whereupon he had a more cruel
whipping than the two former times, and there was given him a present of four hundred
Crowns, together with eighteen Peasants to be his slaves; with a strict charge, not to entertain
any animosity against his wife, who made this advantage thereby, that, ever after, they
liv'd very lovingly together.
                  But now they proceed with more caution, and no man is condemn'd without an exact information
of the Crime laid to his charge. And for the utter taking away of all calumny, the Accuser
must be content to endure the Torture first; and if, while he is in the Torment, he persist
in his accusation, the accused person is also put to it, nay, many times he is condemn'd without
so much as being heard. We saw an example of this in the wife of one of the Great Duke's
Farriers, who desirous to be rid of her husband, charg'd him that he would have poyson'd the
Horses, and had he the opportunity, even the Great Duke himself. She endur'd the Torture
without varying in her accusation, and her husband was sent to Prison into Siberia. We were
shew'd the woman, who was still paid the one half of her husband's Pension. From this kind of
demeanour among the Muscovites, and their infidelity one to another, it may be judg'd, what
strangers are to expect from them, and how far they are to be trusted. They never proffer their
friendship, nor contract any with others, but for their own interest and advantage. The ill
education they have when young, never learning any thing beyond reading and writing, and certain
vulgar prayers, makes them blindly follow that which in Beasts is called Instinct; so that
Nature being in them depraved and corrupted, their whole life must needs be a constant course

of viciousness. Thence it comes, they are bruitish, doing all things according to their unbridled
passions and appetites.
                  The fierceness of all other Nations, some Islanders excepted, argues something of Spirit and
Generosity; but the opinion the Muscovites have of themselves and their abilities, is sottish,
gross, and impertinent; and the pride and vain glory of those who are ever so little advanc'd in
Honours or Estates, is insupportable. They dissemble it not, but all their behaviour, words,
and actions, discover what they really are. Upon this principle they ground the fond conceit
they have of the greatness, power, and wealth of their Prince, whom they preferr before all the
other Monarchs of Europe. Thence it is also, that they would not have other Princes assume those
qualities which may denote their competition with him. They sottishly and insolently command
Ambassadors to be uncover'd first, and by force take all advantage over them, imagining it
were a great injury to themselves and their Prince, to treat Strangers with any civility. Private
persons write and speak in unhandsome terms, but such as give the less offence, in that they bear
with the same treatment from others. 'Tis true, they began to learn a little civility, since they
became sensible of the advantages arising to them from the Commerce they have with Strangers,
and there are some use them with discretion: but of these there are very few, and, excepting
Nikita, whom we have spoken of, and two or three more, it would be hard to find as many
others that deserve this commendation.
                  Nor have they any more complyance one for another,Have no civility. than they have difference for strangers;
for instead of being civil one to another, they take place, and all other advantages, one of another.
When we were at Nisenovogorod, the Chancellor's Steward coming to see us, the Ambassadors
invited him to Dinner; but when they were to sit down, the Pristaf would take place
of him, which begat a contestation concerning their quality. One, as he was a Sinbojar, or
Gentleman, pretended to precedence before the Pristaf, who was not a person eminent by birth;
the later, being there upon the accompt of his Prince, would not have the other to make any
comparison with him. Whore's son and dog were the mildest of their term; for half an hour
and better, and that without any respect for the Ambassadors, who were at last forc'd to tell
them, that they had invited them to be merry, and not to be troubled with their contests, and
entreated them, at that time, to eat and drink, and to take some other, to decide their differences.
They took their advice, and grew such good friends, as if the entertainment had been appointed
for their reconciliation, which seem'd to be very sincere in their Wine, which, according
to their custome made them kindly drunk.
                  They are all much given to quarrelling,Quarrelsome. in so much that in the streets they will rail at, and
abuse one another like Fish-Wives, and that with such animosity, that those who are not acquainted
with their humour think they will not part without fighting; but they seldome come
to those extremities, or if they fight, it is with their fists, or switches, and the height of their
rage is kicking, as much as they can, in the belly and about the sides. 'Twas never yet known
that any Muscovite fought with Sword or Pistol, or that they are sensible of that gallantry
wherein many would unjustly place true courage. The great Lords, Knez and Bojares, fight on
horse-back, but the weapon is a good Whip, and so they soon decide what differences happen
between them.
                  When they quarrel,Insolent in their expressions. they forbear cursing, swearing and blaspheming, but rail at one another
in such bitter and horrid expressions, as no Country being able to parallel them, 'tis but discretion
to forbear defiling this relation therewith. The language of Fathers and Mothers to their
Children??? and of the Children to them again, is such as cannot be express'd without horrour,
much beyond what the most debauch'd persons elsewhere are guilty of. Some years since the
Great Duke prohibited these insolences upon pain of whipping, and the Magistrate was ordered
to send Strelits and Serjeants among the people to surprise Offenders, and to see them immediately
punish'd. But it was sound by experience, that the remedy came too late, and that the
mischief was so deeply rooted, and so generally spread, that it was, not only hard, but absolutely
impossible to put those prohibitions in execution. So that, for the vindication of persons
of quality an order was made, that he who affronts any such, or any of the Great Duke's
Officers, either by word or deed, should be fined, which fine they call Biscestia, and sometimes
amounts to 2000. Crowns, according to the quality of the Person injur'd. If an Officer of the
Great Duke's makes his complaint of injury done him, his reparation will be according to his
relation to the Court. To a Lady, 'tis doubled, to a Son, 'tis augmented by a third part; to a
Daughter, there is an abatement of a third part: and the penalty is paid as many times as there
are persons injured, though they were dead many years before. If the Offender hath not to pay,
he is put into his Adversaries hands, who disposes of him so as to make him his Slave, or cause
him to be whipt by the common Executioner. One Iohn Barnley, an English Merchant, of
whom we shall speak elsewhere, was sentenc'd to pay the Biscestia to another English man, Dr.
Day, Physician to the Great Duke; and Capt. de la Coste, a French Gentleman found means to
make an exchange of the penalty laid upon him at the sute of a German Colonel, for that
which the same Colonel was to pay another French man, named Anthony le Groin, who was
pleas'd thereby to oblige his friend, la Coste.
                  
                     
There is nothing polite in their conversation; on the contrary, they are not asham'd to yawn,
belch, and stretch themselves, where ever they are, their belching being the more offensive,
by reason of the abundance of Onions and Garlick they use in all theit meat, which make their
breaths strong enough, without those exaltations. This they are so accustom'd to, that they
stick not to do it in any company, the Great Duke's presence only excepted.
                  They do not apply themselves to the study of any Art or Science,Not addicted to any study. nor inquire into the affairs
of other Countries, and consequently never discourse of any such thing: but it were well on the
other side, if they could forbear talking of their uncleannesses and brutalities, which they
make their divertisement in their debauches. I speak not of the Entertainments of Great Lords,
but of the ordinary company keeping of the Muscovites, where all their discourse is of the abhominations
which they themselves have done, or seen committed by others, making ostentation
of the crimes which here would be expiated by fire, and the memory thereof buried in their
ashes. But as they are wholly given up to all licentionsness, even to sins against Nature, not
only with Men, but also with Beasts, he who can tell most stories of that kind, and set them
out in most gestures, is accompted the bravest Man. Their Fidlers put them into Songs, and
their Mountebanks make publick representations of them, and stick not to shew their Breeches,
and sometimes all they have to their Spectators. Those who lead Bears about, Juglers; and
Puppet-players, who erect a Stage in a moment, by the means of a coverlet, which, being
ty'd about their wast, is brought over their heads, and within it show their Puppets, representing
their brutalities, and sodomies, make sport to the Children, who are thereby induc'd
to quit all sentiments of shame and honesty.
                  Nay these are quite discarded by the Muscovites.Shameless The postures of their dancing, and the insolence
of their Women, are infallible marks of their bad inclinations. We have seen at Moscou
both Men and Women come out of the publick Brothell-houses stark naked, and incite some
young people of our retinue to naughtiness by filthy and lascivious expressions. Idleness, which
is the Mother of all Vices, and seems to have been bestow'd on these barbarous people as their
portion, is that which makes them run into these excesses, whereto their drunkenness does also
contribute; in as much as being naturally inclin'd to luxury, when they are once got into
their Wine they mind nothing else. I have to this purpose a story, which the Great Duke's
Interpreter told me when we were at Novogorod: how that in the said City, there is an anniversary
devotion, to which come abundance of Pilgrims. He who is allow'd to keep a tipling-house,
gets a permission from the Metropolitan, to pitch several Tents, for the accommodation
of the Pilgrims of both Sexes, who are sure to be there betimes in the morning before service,
and to take off some Cups of strong-water. Nay some of them instead of minding their
devotions spend the day in drinking, whence arise such strange disorders, that he told me, he
saw a Woman got so drunk there, that coming out of the Tent she fell down; and fell asleep,
naked as she was, in the street, in the day time. Which gave occasion to a Muscovite, who
was also drunk, to lye down by her, and, having made use of her, to fall also asleep in sight
of many people, who having made a ring about them, only laught at the posture they were in,
till at last an old man, conceiving a horrour at the spectacle, cover'd them with his own garment.
                  There's no place in the World where drunkenness is more common than in Muscovy.Drunkards. All, of
all conditions, Ecclesiasticks and Laicks, Men and Women, Old and Young, will drink
strong-water at any time, before, at, and after their meals. They call it Tzarkowino, and
fail not to offer of it to those who visit them. The lowest sort of people, Peasants and Slaves,
refuse not the Cups which are given them by some person of Quality, but will drink of it till
they lye down, and many times dye in the place. Nay their Great ones are not free from this
vice, as for example, the Muscovian Ambassador, sent to Charles King of Sueden, in the
year 1608. who, forgetting his quality and the affairs his Master had entrusted him with, took
so much strong-water the night before he was to have audience, that the next day being found
dead in his bed, they were forc'd to carry him to his Grave, instead of conducting him to Audience.
                  The meaner sort of people think it not enough to stay in the Tipling-house till they have not a
Copec left in their purses, but many times pawn their cloaths there even to their shirts, which is
no more than what is seen dayly during our aboad at Moscou. Being lodg'd at Lubeck-house,
as I went to Novogorod, in my Voyage to Muscovy in 1643. I saw coming out of an Ale-house
not far thence, several of those Drunkards, some without Caps, others without Shoes or Stockins,
some without Wastcoats, and only their Shirts. One I took notice of above the rest, who came
our first without his Kaftan, and in his Shirt, but meeting a friend by the way going to the
Tipling-house, he went back with him, and came not out again till he had left his shirt behind
him. I call'd to him, and ask'd him what he had done with his shirt, and whether he had been
robb'd? He answer'd with the ordinary civility of the Muscovites, Iabut fui matir, Mind
thy own business; Good Wine hath put me into this posture: but since the shirt hath stayd behind,
the Drawers shall go and keep them company, which he had no sooner said, but he returns to the

house, whence I saw him come presently afterward naked as an Adamite, covering his privy
parts with a handful of flowers, which he had taken up at the door, and so went very cundly
to his own house.
                  Being in the same City of Novogorod at the time of our second Embassy, I saw a Priest coming
out of the Tipling-house, who coming by our Lodging would needs give the benediction to
the Strclits, who stood Sentinel at the door, but as he lifted up his hands, going to make the
inclination used in that Ceremony, the head, fraught with the vapours of the Wine, was so
heavy, that weighing down the whole body, the Pope fell down in the dirt. Our Strclits took
him up with much respect, and receiv'd his daggled benediction; it being, it seems, a thing very
ordinary among them.
                  The Great Duke Michael Federouits, who was a sober person, and hated drunkenness, considering
with himself that it was impossible absolutely to prevent those excesses, made in his
time several orders for the moderating of them, causing the Tipling-houses to be shut up, and
prohibiting the selling of strong-water or Hydromel without his permission, and that those places
where they were sold, should sell only by the Quart and Pint, and not by Cups. This had
some effect, in that there was no more Adamites seen in the streets, but hindred not their being
strew'd with Drunkards, the Neighbours and such of their friends, as had a design to be merry,
sending to the Tavern for several Pottles of Strong-water, which they would be sure to turn off
ere they parted.
                  The women are no less given to drink than the men.Women given to drink. I saw a pleasant example of it at Narva,
in the house where I lodg'd, whither many Muscovian women came one day to their husbands,
sate down with them, and took off their Cups as smartly as they did. The men being
got drunk, would have gone home, but the women thought it not yet time to draw off, though
invited thereto by a good number of boxes o'th'ear, and got their husbands to sit down again,
and to drink roundly as before, till such time as that the men being fall'n down asleep upon the
ground, the women sate upon them, as upon benches, and drunk on till they also were forc'd to
lye down by them.
                  Iames de Cologne, at whose house I lodg'd at Narva, told me he had seen such another Comedy
at his Wedding; at which, the Muscovites having given their Wives good banging, sate
down and drunk with them, till that being lay'd on the ground, the Women sate upon them,
and grew so drunk, till at last they lay down among them.
                  Tobacco was heretofore so common there,Tobacco forbidden among them. that it was generally taken, both in smoak and
powder. To prevent the mischiefs occasion'd by the use of it, which were not only, that the
poorer sort of people ruin'd themselves thereby, in as much as if they had but a penny, they
would rather bestow it in Tobacco than bread, but also because many times it set houses on fire
and those that took it presented themselves with their stinking and infectious breaths before their
Images, the Great Duke and the Patriarch thought fit in the year 1634. absolutely to forbid the
sale and use of it. Those who are convicted of having either taken or sold any, are very rigorously
punish'd. They have their Nostrils slit or are whipp'd, as we have often seen done; of
the manner of which punishment we shall speak when we come to treat of the administration of
Justice in that Countrey.
                  The perverse disposition of the Muscovites,They are born to slavery. the baseness of their education, and the slavery
they seem born to, cause them to be treated like beasts, rather than people endued with reason.
They are naturally so much inclin'd to leness, that it were impossible to bring them to take
any pains, but by the Whip and the Cudgel, which yet they are not much troubled at, as
being hardened to blows, by the custom which the younger sort have to meet on Holy-dayes,
and to divert themselves by cuffing or fighting with staves, never being angry at what happens.
Those who are free-born, but poor, do so little value that advantage, that they sell themselves
with their family for a small matter; nay, they are so mindless of their liberty, that they will
sell themselves a second time, after they had recovered it, by the death of their Master, or some
other occasion.
                  Their submissions to their Superiours discover the lowness of their spirits, and their slavery.
They never come before persons of quality, but they bow down to the ground, which they
touch and smite with their forehead, nay, there are some will cast themselves at their Lords
feet, to give them thanks after they had been sufficiently beaten by them. No Muscovite, what
quality soever he be of, but makes it his brag, to be the Great Duke's Golop, or Slave: and to
express their humility or adjection, even in the least things, they put their names into diminutives,
and neither speak nor write to him, but instead of Iwan, or Iohn, they say Iwantske, that
is the diminutive; and sign thus, Petrusketwoy Golop, Petrillo your slave. The Great Duke
speaking to them uses the same expression, treating them in all things like slaves, as far as Whips
and Cudgels can do it, which is but consonant to their own acknowledgement, That their persons
and estates are God's and the Great Duke's.
                  Those strangers who settle in Muscovy,Strangers are in no better condition there or are entertain'd into the Czaar's service, must
resolve to do the same submissions, and be content with the same treatment. For what kindness

soever he may have for them, it requires so small a matter to deserve the Whip, that there is
hardly any can brag he hath not had it. Heretofore there were none more subject to the Lash,
than the Physicians, it being the perswasion of the Muscovites, that that art was infallible, and
that the success of it depended on their wills, who profess'd the curing of diseases. Hence was it,
that in the year 160. Iohn Duke of Holstein, brother to Christian the fourth King of Denmark,
who had married the Great Duke Boris Gudenous daughter, falling sick, the Czaar sent word
to the Physicians, that if they recovered him not, their lives should answer for the Prince's: so
that they seeing the remedies apply'd were fruitless, and that it was impossible to save the
Prince, kept out of the way, and durst not come into the Great Duke's presence, till he himself
was troubled with the Gowt, and sent for them. Among the rest, there was one a German,
who having practised Physick some time in Muscovy, had some thoughts of returning
into Germany to take the degree of Doctor. But the Great Duke desirous to know the occasion
upon which he desir'd leave to go, understanding that he went thither to be examin'd, and so
take his Degree, which the Faculty gives and confirms by its Letters Patents, he told him, that
having been often eas'd of his pain by his remedies, he was satisfy'd of his sufficiency; and,
as to Letters, if there were any need of them, he would give him such as should be as authentick
as any he could get from the Universities of Germany, and so he needed not put himself to
the trouble and expence of that journey.
                  This Physician was one of those who kept out of the way upon the Duke of Holstein's death,
and imagining the Great Duke would send for him in order to his execution, he put on a tatter'd
Garment, and having his hair negligently hanging down over his eyes and face, he came
in that posture to the Great Duke's Chamber-door, into which he went, creeping on all four,
and coming to his bed-side, told him, that he was not worthy to live, much less be admitted
into his Majesties presence, since he was so unfortunate as to be out of his favour. Upon which
one of the Knez, who were about the Duke, thinking to make his Prince some sport, treated
him as a Sabak, or Dog, kick'd him in the head, and drew blood of him. The Physician,
perceiving the great Duke look'd favourably on him, thought fit to make his advantage of it,
and with a certain confidence said to him, Great Prince, I know I am your Slave, but be pleas'd
to give me leave to tell you, that I am only yours. I know I have deserv'd death, and should think
my self happy to receive it from your hands; but it troubles me to be affronted by this Knez, who is
but your Slave as well as my self; and I think it is not your desire, that any other should have power
over me. These words, and the need the Great Duke stood in of this Physician, procur'd him
a present of a thousand Crowns; his Fellow-Physicians were pardoned, and the Bojar had a
good cudgelling.
                  As for slaves,They keep many Slaves. their number is not regulated, some Lords have above a hundred of them in
their Country-houses and Farms, Those they entertain for their service in the City; do not diet
in their houses, but have board-wages, their allowance so small, that it is as much as they
can do to live upon it. And this is one of the chiefest causes of the many disorders and mischiefs
done at Moscou, there passing hardly a night but violences and murthers are committed. Great
Lords and rich Merchants have a Guard in their Courts, who watch all night, and are oblig'd
to express their vigilance, by the noise they make upon boards with a stick, much after the
manner of playing upon the Timbrels, which done, they give as many knocks as the Clock hath
struck hours. But these Guards watching many times more for the advantage of house-breakers,
than that of their Masters, there is none used now, and no servant is taken into a house, but
upon good City-security for his truth.
                  This great number of slaves makes it unsafe to walk the streets of Moscou, in the night time
un-arm'd and without Company. We had the experience of it in some of our servants, upon
several occasions. Our Master-Cook, who had been employ'd at a person's of quality, where
the Ambassadors had Dined, was kill'd as he came home in the night; which misfortune happen'd
also to the Steward belonging to the Suedish Ambassador, Spiring. The Lieutenant, who
had commanded our German and Scotch Musketiers, in our Voyage into Persia, was in like
manner kill'd in the night, having been with some others at the Wedding of a German Merchants
daughter. And as there passed no night almost without murther, so these disorders increas'd
towards great Festivals, especially on flesh days, which they call Maslouitzo. On St.
Mastin's Eve, we counted fifteen dead bodies in the Court of Semskoy, a place where they are
expos'd, that their kinred and friends may know them, and take order for their burial. If no
body owns them, they are dragg'd thence like Carrion, and thrown into a Ditch without any
Ceremony.
                  The insolence of these Villains is so great, that they stuck not to set upon the Great Duke's
principal Physician in the day time. They stopp'd him in the street as he was going home, struck
him off his horse, and would have cut off his finger, on which he had a Gold Seal-ring, had
he not been reliev'd by some sent to his rescue, by a Knez of his acquaintance, who living near
thereabouts had seen him set upon. The misery is, that no Citizen will so much as look out at
his window, much less come out of his house, to relieve those that are affronted, so much are

they afraid to come into the same misfortue they see others engag'd in. Since our being there,
some course hath been taken herein, Watches being set, who stop those who go in the night
without Torch or Lanthorn, and carry them to the Strelitse priscas, where they are punish'd
the next day.
                  At Hay-making time, the road between Moscou and Tuere is very dangerous to travel, by
reason of the great number of slaves employ'd in that work, making their advantage of a Mountain
whence they discover those that pass, whom they rob and kill, without any reparation to
be expected from their Masters, who, not allowing their slaves what to subsist upon, are forc'd
to connive at their Crimes.
                  Masters dispose of their slaves, as they do of any other moveable; nay, a father may sell his
son, and alienate him, for his own advantage. But the Muscovites have this piece of vainglory,
that not only they seldom come to those extremities, but also had rather see their Children
starve at home, than suffer them to go out any where to service. 'Tis only debt that sometimes
engages them to make over their Children to their Creditors, the Boyes at ten, the Girls,
at eight Crowns, a year, the Children being no less oblig'd to satisfie the debt, than their fathers,
as also to endure that cruel treatment, which desperate debtors are to expect, or to sell
themselves to their Creditors.
                  The subjection in which they are born,They are good Soldiers. and the gross feeding they have even from their infancy,
at which time they are taught to be content with any thing, makes them very good Souldiers,
and such as would do very great services under strang Commanders. For though the Military
Discipline of the Romans allow'd not the listing of slaves in their Legions, yet does it not
follow, but that the Muscovites, who are all such, may be advantageously employ'd in War,
this being certain of them, that they are excellent good in a besieg'd place, and will maintain it
to the utmost extremity. Of this we have an example at Notebourg, where two men made
their capitulation in the year 1579. The Poles, who had besieg'd the Castle of Suikols, set it a
fire as they were giving the assault; yet the Muscovites made good the breach and maintain'd
it, even when the fire reach'd their Cloaths. At the siege of the Abbey of Padis, in Livonia,
they held out till they became so weakned for want of Provisions, that they were not able to
keep Guard, nor to meet the Suedes at the Gate.
                  They are not indeed so fortunate in the field, and very seldom gain'd any battel against the
Poles or Suedes, their Neighbours, who have alwayes almost had the better of them, so that it
prov'd a harder matter to pursue them, than to avoid their blows. But certain it is withall, that
these misfortunes happen to them through the want of experience and conduct in their Generals,
rather than of courage in their Soldiers.
                  For as to the disgrace the Muscovites receiv'd at the Siege of Smolensko,The Siege of Smolensko. in the year 1633.
it is to be ascribed to the Generals perfidiousness, who paid his Master for his imprudence in putting
the command of his Army into the hands of a Stranger. He was a Polander, named Herman
Schein, who to curry favour with the Duke, had been so low-spirited as to receive re-baptization.
The Army he commanded, consisted of above a hundred thousand men, among whom
were above 6000. Germans, and several Muscovian Regiments exercised according to the German
discipline, and commanded by strange Officers, French, Germans, and Scots, three hundred
pieces of Cannon, and all other things requisite to carry on the Siege against that place,
which the Poles had taken some time before from the Muscovites. The reduction of it had been so
much the easier, n that the City is compass'd but with one simple wall, without ditch, or any
kind of fortification. Whence it came, that the Germans, who had made a reasonable breach
in it, propos'd to have it carried at the first assault. But the General oppos'd it, saying, That
he would never suffer, it should be reproach'd to the Prince his Master, that he had rais'd so
vast an Army to besiege a place, which a handful of Germans would have taken in so few dayes,
and then presently to disband it. The Colonels that were Strangers, on the other side, considering
that the Great Duke's reputation would suffer by that Siege, and the Army it self be destroy'd
if it were not employ'd, resolv'd to give the assault, and were in a manner Masters of the
breach, when the General commanding the great Guns to be discharg'd at them, they were
forc'd to retreat. They complain'd of that procedure, so far as to make some discoveries of
their distrust of his fidelity; but he sent them word, that if they kept not within the respect due
to their General, he should find a way to chastise them, and that he would treat them as Muscovites.
So that not daring to make any further attempt, the Army continu'd there some time
without doing any thing, and gave the King of Poland time enough to get together a small body
of 5000. men, who possess'd themselves of all the avenues, by which the Muscovites receiv'd
their provisions, so as that within a few dayes their Army was more straightly besieg'd than the
City it self. It had been easy for the Muscovian General to prevent the Poles from taking up
those posts, but he gave them the leasure so to fortify themselves in them, that it had been impossible
for him to force them in their quarters, even if he had attempted it. The Muscovian
Army being reduc'd to this extremity, the General, to hinder it from starving, was forc'd to
capitulate with the Poles; to come in with the whole Army at mercy, and, with all that Noble

Artillery, to leave hostages for the ransome of all the Officers and Soldiers, which the Great
Duke was oblig'd to pay. The General was so impudent as to return to Moscou, and shew
himself at Court, where he had friends enough to protect him, notwithstanding the charges put
in against him by the Officers and Soldiers: but the people express'd themselves so mov'd at his
treachery, that to prevent an insurrection, which threatned both City and State, they were
forc'd to execute him publickly in the market-place.
                  Most of the great Ones had a finger in his Treason, but lest he might accuse any, they perswaded
him that he should not be startled at those proceedings, that it was only by way of pageant,
to give the people some satisfaction, and that, before execution, his pardon would be
brought him. Which he the more easily credited, for that his changing Religion had gain'd
him the affection and favour of the Patriarch. But he had no sooner layd his head upon the
block, ere a sign was made to the Executioner to strike it off. The same day was executed also
his Son, who had some command under his Father at the Siege of Smolensko. He was brought
into the open place before the Castle, where he was stripp'd stark naked, and whipp'd to
death. All the rest of his kindred were banish'd into Siberia. This execution happened in Iune,
1634.
                  The Muscovites spend not much in house-keeping,Their hous-keeping. nor the Bojares, as well as those of a lower
condition. It is not above thirty years, that their Lords and chiefest Merchants have built
their houses of stone: for before they were no better lodg'd than the meaner sort, in very poor
wooden buildings. Their houshold-stuff are suitable to their Lodgings, and commonly consist
only in three or four pots, and as many wooden or earthen dishes. Some have pewter, but very
few, and unless it be some few drinking cups, and gobelets, there is not any of silver. They
know not what scowring means, in so much that the Great Duke's plate looks little better than
the Tavern-pots, which are made clean but once a year. The better sort hang their rooms
but with mat; and to set them out yet a little better, they have only two or three Images
wretchedly painted. They have few feather-beds, but are content with mattresses, nay with
chaff or straw, and if not that to be had, they lye upon their cloaths, which in Summer they
lay upon a bench, or table; in the Winter, upon their stoves, which are flat, as in Livonia.
In this Country it is that Master and Mistress, Men and Maids, are shuffled all together into the
same room; nay in some places in the Country, I have seen the Poultry, and the Pigs, had ordinarily
the same Lodging with the Masters of the house.
                  They are not acquainted with our delicate meats and sawces.Their feeding. Their ordinary food is coarse
Meal, Turneps, Coleworth, and Cowcumbers, both fresh and pickled. Their great delicacy
is Salt-fish, which being not well salted, infects the places near it, so that you may smell their
Fish-market at a great distance. They cannot want Beef and Mutton, there being good pastures
all over Muscovy, and the Forests breed such abundance of Swine, that they must needs be very
cheap: but to avoid expence, as also for that their year hath more fasting dayes than flesh
dayes, they are so accustom'd to Fish and Pulse, that they care not for flesh. Add to this, that
their continual fasts have taught them so many wayes to dress their Fish, Herbs, and Pulse,
that a man may well forbear those dishes of meat which are much esteemed elsewhere. We said,
how that the Great Duke willing to entertain us from his own Table, sent us above forty dishes,
most of Pulse and Herbs. Among other things they make a sort of Pies, which they call Piroguen,
about the bigness and fashion of a twopenny Loaf. They fill the crust with Fish or minc'd
meat, with Chibols and a little Pepper, and fry them in a Pan with Butter, and in Lent with
Oil. 'Tis no ill dish, and may be called the Bisque of those parts.
                  The spawn of Fish, especially that of Sturgeon, they order thus. They take off the skin, very
neatly, and then salt them. Having been in salt some eight or ten dayes, and by that means
reduc'd as it were to a paste, they cut it into small slices, putting Onions and Pepper to them,
and they are eaten with Oil and Vinegar like a Salad. It eats much better, if, instead of Vinegar,
you put the juice of Citron. Yet to love this kind of Sallade, a man must be accustomed
to it, though they think it excites appetite and fortifies Nature. The Muscovites call it Ikary,
and the Italians Cavaiar. There is much of it eaten in Italy in the Lent time, instead of
Butter. The best is made upon the Wolgda, and near Astrachan, whence it is transported in
Tunns of 7. or 800. weight, by the way of England and Holland, into Italy. The Great Duke
reserves the Trade of this Commodity to himself, farms it out, and makes a very great yearly
advantage of it. To dispel the vapours rising up to the head, after excessive drinking, they take
cold roasted Veal, mince it, not too small, with some pickled Cowcumbers, adding thereto a
sawce of Pepper, Vinegar, and the juice of pickled Cowcumbers, and eat it with spoons. It recovers
appetite, and tasts well enough.
                  Their ordinary drink is a sort of small Beer which they call Quas, or Hydromel; but they
never eat, without a dram of the Strong-water botle before and after their meal. Persons of
quality are furnish'd with strong Beer, Sack, and all other sorts of Wine. Their strong Beer is
brew'd in March, and kept all Summer in their Snow-houses, where they make a bed of
Ice and Snow mixt together, and then a layer of Barrels: upon them again a bed of Ice, and

then another row of Barrels, covering them with straw and planks, which are instead of a vault
to them; for their Cellars are not covered.
                  The Muscovites care not much for Rhenish nor French Wines,Hydromel how made. thinking them not strong
enough; but they love Hydromel, which they order with Cherries, Straw-berries, Mulberries,
or Rasp-berries. That they make with Rasp-berries is the most pleasant of any. To make it
well, they put the Rasp-berries a-soaking in fair water for two or three nights, till the water
hath got their taste and colour. Into this water they put some of the purest Honey, allowing
to every pound of Hony three or four of water, as they would have the Hydromel strong or
small. They put into it a Toast dipp'd in the dreggs of Beer, which is taken out as soon as the
Hydromel begins to work, lest, continu'd longer, it should give it an ill taste. If they desire it
should be long a-working, they put it into some warm place; but if it be for present drinking,
they put it in a cool place, where it soon gives over working, and then is taken off the Lees to
be spent. To better the taste of it, they put in a little bag of Cinnamon, and grains of Paradise,
with some few Cloves. Some instead of fair water, steep the Rasp-berries 24 hours in
common Aquavitae, which gives the Hydromel an excellent tast.
                  Common Hydromel is made of the Honey-combs, which they beat in warm-water, stirring
it much, and after it hath rested seven or eight hours, they cleanse it through a Sieve, boyl it,
scum it, and without any more ado expose it to sale.
                  Persons of Quality discover themselves by their retinue and expence,The expences of Persons of quality. which yet is not so great
as might be imagin'd. For though they have sometimes 50. 60. or more Slaves about them,
their stables well furnish'd, and make great feasts well supply'd with Meat, and all sorts of Beer,
Wine, Hydromel, and Strong-water, yet all comes from their Country-houses and Dairies,
so as that they buy but very little. Their entertainments are so many baits to draw in Presents,
which they expect of those that are not of their own quality, in so much that they deerly buy
the honour which the Knez and Bojares do them upon such occasions. Strange Merchants know
well enough what that honour is to cost them, and desire it not, but to gain the favour of the
Great ones, whose countenance they stand in need of. The Weywodes are sure to make two or
three of these entertainments yearly in their Governments.
                  The greatest honour a Muscovite thinks he can do his friend, is to let him see his Wife,The highest act of Muscovian civility. to
be presented with a Cup of Strong-water by her, and to permit he should kiss her. Count Leo
Alexander de Slakou gave me to understand so much at my being in Muscovy in the year 1643.
Having dined with him, he made me withdraw into another Chamber, where he told me, that
he could not make a greater expression of the respects he had for me, nor a greater acknowledgment
of the obligation he had to his Highness, than to shew me his Wife. She presently
came in, very richly clad in her wedding-cloaths, and follow'd by a Gentlewoman with a bottle
of Strong water and a Silver Cup. The Lady bid her fill out, and having put it to her
mouth, presented it to me, and oblig'd me to drink it off; which I dd thrice together. That
done, the Count would have me kiss her, which I the more wondred at, in regard that kind
of civility is not yet known in Holstein. Wherefore I would have contented my self to have
kiss'd only her hand; but he so kindly engag'd me to kiss her lips, that there was no avoiding
of it. She presented me a Handkercher, embroider'd at the extremities with Gold, Silver and
Silk, with a deep fringe, such as are presented to the Bride on her Wedding day. Afterwards
I found a note fasten'd to it, wherein was the name of Stresnof, Uncle by the Fathers side to
the Great Dutchess.
                  The Knez and Bojares have not only pensions and considerable allowances, but also great
real estates. Merchants and Tradesmen live by Commerce and their Trades. Those who may
go out of the Country, and are permitted to Traffick into Persia, Poland, Sueden, and Germany,
carry thither Sables; and other furs, flax, hemp, and Russia-leather.
                  Tradesmen find it not hard to gain a subsistence for their families, by reason of the plenty of
all manner of Provisions. They are very handy, and easily imitate any thing they see done,
though they are not so rich in inventions as the Germans and other Europaeans; for I have seen
some of their carv'd works as well done as the best in Germany; so that strangers who are not
willing to have the secret of their professions discovered, must take heed of Muscovites, Iohn
Valk, whom we mention'd before, would never cast any thing in their presence. Now they
cast pieces of Artillery themselves, and Valk's Disciple made a Bell, while we were there, which
weigh'd 7700 poudes, which amount to 3080 hundred weight. But it had not been long us'd
ere it crack'd, and now 'tis broken to pieces, and another to be made of a far greater weight
than the former.
                  No Muscovite,They sleep after Dinner. what condition or quality soever he be of, but sleeps after Dinner; whence
it is that about noon most shops are shut up, and the Merchants or their Apprentices sleeping at
the door: so that about that time, there is no more speaking with Persons of Quality or Merchants,
than there is at midnight.
                  This was one sign whereby they discovered the imposture of the counterfeit Demetrius. We
shall find in the ensuing story of him, that the Impostor slept not after Dinner, and that the

Muscovites inferr'd thence that he was a stranger; as also by his aversion to Baths, which are
so common in Muscovy, that there is neither Town nor Village, but hath very many of them,
both publick and private. This is all they have gentile among them, as a thing they conceive
necessary upon several occasions, especially at Marriages. after the first Coition.
                  At Astrachan,Their stoves and bathing places. I had the curiosity to go unknown into one of them, which by a division of
boards was contriv'd into two rooms. But, besides that it was easie to look out of one into the
other, by reason of the distance there was between the boards, both men and women went in
and out at the same door, those of either Sex who would express a greater modesty hiding
what they would not have seen with a handful of leaves, which being dry'd in Summer, they,
for this purpose put a-soking into warm water: but some were stark naked, and the women
were not shy to come in that posture and speak with their husbands, even while other men
stood by.
                  'Tis almost a Miracle to see how their bodies, accustomed to, and hardned by cold, can endure
so intense a heat, and how that, when they are not able to endure it any longer, they
come out of the stoves, naked as the back of a man's hand, both men and women, and go into
the cold water, or cause it to be poured upon them, and, in Winter, how they wallow in
the Snow. Some of our young men would often walk before these publick stoves, to see the
several postures of the women that came out, and diverted themselves in the water, and were
so far from being asham'd, that they would talk wantonly with them, and were not troubled
when any of our people came into the water to them. And this we saw not only in Muscovy,
but also in Livonia, where the Inhabitants, especially the Finlanders, who are setled there,
going out of these stoves, in the coldest of Winter, run into the Snow, and rub their bodies
with it, as if it were Soap, then return into the stoves to take the advantage of a more moderate
heat: and all this so as that this change of contrary qualities does not any way prejudice their
health. The reason then of it must be Custom, in as much as being thus used from their Childhood,
and that habit being as it were converted into a second nature, they are indifferently enured
to both heat and cold.
                  At Narva we had Muscovian boys of about 8, 9, or 10. years of age, whom we employ'd
about the Kitchin. These would stand half an hour together barefoot upon the Ice, like so many
Geese, in the depth of Winter, and never complain of cold, The stoves belonging to the
Germans, who live in Muscovy and Livonia, ae very sumptuous, and it is no less pleasant bathing
in them. The floor is strew'd with Pine leaves beaten to powder, all sorts of Herbs and
Flowers, which raise a very sweet smell, as also the Ly which they make very odoriferous.
Along the Walls are seats, or benches, upon which a man lies to sweat and be rubb'd, some
higher than others, that one may take such a degree of heat as he pleases, and they are all cover'd
with clean sheets, and pillows fill'd with Hay. Every one hath a Servant-maid, who having
only her smock on, rubs, washes, and wipes him, and what else is requisite. As she comes
in, she presents you on a Trencher, with some Radish sli'd, with a little Salt, and if you are
known in the house, the Mistress her self or her Daughter will present you with a certain composition,
consisting of Wine and Beer, in which will be some bread crum'd, Citron sliced, Sugar
and Nutmeg. When this civility is omitted, it argues the Master of the house hath no great
respect for his Guest. After bathing a man is put into a bed, then rises to eat something, and having
eaten goes to bed again to sleep.
                  The Muscovites are of a healthy and strong constitution, long liv'd, and seldom sick; which
when they are, their ordinary remedies, even in burning Feavers, is only Garlick and Strongwaters.
Persons of quality make  of Physicians, though but within these few years, and are
perswaded that remedies may do them good.
                  Fornication is very common among them, and yet they permit not publick stews, which divers
other Christian Princes not only permit, but anthorise, and have an advantage arising out
of them for their protection. Marriage is thought honourable among them, and Polygamy
forbidden. A Widdower or Widdow may Marry twice or thrice, but must not offer at a
fourth Marriage, which if they should, the Priest that should bless them would be cast
off.
                  They observe in their Marriages the degrees of Consanguinity, and do not willingly marry
such as are near to them either by Kinred or Allyance. Nor do they permit two Brothers to
marry two Sisters; and they observe also a spiritual Allyance, not suffering that Godfathers
and Godmothers to the same person should intermarry. The celebration of Marriage among
them is thus.
                  Young Men and Maids are not suffer'd to see one another,The Ceremonies of their marriages. much less to have any discourse of
marriage, or to make any promise one to another, by word or writing. But when those who
have Children marriageable, especially daughters, have found out a match they like, they
speak to the young mans Parents, and declare the desire they have to make an Allyance with
them. If they approve of what is proposed, and the young man desire to see the maid, yet is it
absolutly deny'd. If she be hansom, they will be content the mother or some other woman of the

kinred, should see her, and if she be no way defective; that is, neither blind nor lame, the
friends on both sides treat about the marriage, and conclude all things, the intended young
couple not so much as being allow'd to see one another. For they bring up their daughters in very
private Chambers (especially persons of quality) where they keep them lock'd up, so as
that the Bridegroom does not see his Bride till she is brought into his Chamber. And thus it
comes to pass, that he who thinks he hath married a handsom Maid, hath some crooked piece
put upon him; nay, instead of the Mans Daughter he was to have, some kinswoman or servantmaid
is thrust upon him; of which I have several examples. So that it is not to be wondred at,
that matrimonial discontents are so frequent among them.
                  When their Great Lords, Knez, and Bojares dispose of their Children in marriage, there is
appointed on the Bride-groom's side a Woman, whom they call Suacha, and another on the
Brides, who joyntly take order for the Nuptials. That on the Brides part, goes upon the
Wedding-day to the Bridegroom's Lodgings, and there makes ready the Nuptial bed. She is
attended by above a hundred men servants, who are all clad in Hogrelines, or long Coats, and
carry on their heads, the things necessary for the Bed and Chamber, where the new Marryed
couple are to lye. The Bed is made upon forty sheaves of Rye, which the young
man causes to be rank'd in order,The nuptial bed. and compass'd about with several Barrels full of Wheat, Barley,
and Oats???
                  All things being ready, the young man goes from his own house late in the evening, accompany'd
by all his Kinred, having before him, on hors-back, the Priest, by whom he is to be
married. At his Bride's door, he meets with all her friends, who receive him and his retinue,
and press them to sit down at a Table. Three dishes of meat are serv'd up, but no body eats of
them, and there is left at the upper end of the Table a place for the Bridegroom: but while he
is talking with the Bride's friends, a young Lad sits down in it, and will not be gotten thence till
the Bridegroom hath made him so many Presents, that he is content to give him the place. The
Bridegroom having taken his place, the Bride is brought in most richly Clad, having a Veil
over her face. She is seated by the Bridegroom, but to prevent their seeing one another, they
are separated by a piece of Crimson Taffata, which is held up by two young Lads while they
are set. Thus done, the Bride's Suacha comes to her, Paints her, tyes up her hair in two knots,
puts the Crown on her head, and dresses her in all things like a married woman. The Crown
is of leaves of Gold, or Silver Gilt, beaten very thin, lined with some silk stuff, and towards
the Ears, it hath five or six rows of great Pearls, which fall down on her breast. The Robe, or
upper Garment, the sleeves whereof are an Ell and a half wide, is embroider'd with Gold and
Pearls at the extremities, especially at the neck, which is three fingers broad, and so heightned
with Embroidery, that it looks more like a Dogs Collar than any thing else, and this kind of
Robe amounts to above a thousand Crowns. The heels of their shooes, as well of those that
are betroath'd, as of most of the other women and maids, are above half a foot high, so that
being as it were a-tip-toe, they have much ado to stand. The other Suacha Paints the Bridegroom,
and in the mean time, the women get up on benches and sings several foolish songs.
After this come in two young men richly Clad, carrying between them upon a Beer a very large
Cheese, and some Loaves, there hanging from the Beer several Martins skins. The like is
brought in on the Bride's part, and the Priest, having blessed them, sends them to Church. At
last there is set on the Table a great Silver-basin, fill'd with little pieces of Satin and Taffata,
about such a bigness as were fit to make little purses of, little square pieces of Silver, Hops,
Barley, and Oats; all mixt together. The Suacha having cover'd the Brides face again, takes
certain handfuls out of the Basin, and casts them among the company, who in the mean time
sing a song, and take up what they find upon the ground.
                  In the Church,The Ceremonies in the Church. where the Benediction is to be given, they cover some part of the floor with
Crimson Taffata, upon which the young Couple stand, having over them another piece of the
same stuff. Before they are married, the Priest makes them go to the offering, which consists in
Fish, Fry'd Meats, and Pastry. That done, the married receive the Benediction, which is given
by holding Images over their heads, and the Priest taking the man by the right hand, and
the woman by the left at the same time, asks them three times, whether it is with their consent
that they are married, and whether they will love one another as they ought to do. Having
both answer'd, yes, all the Company joyn hands, and the Priest sings the 128. Psalm, he one
verse, and the Company the next, dancing at the mean time, much after the same manner as
they do in these parts, who sing and dance at the same time. The Psalm ended, he puts a Garland
of Rue upon their heads, or about their shoulders, if it be a Widdow or Widdower, saying,
Increase and Multiply, and then consummates the marriage, pronouncing these words,
Whom God hath joyned together let no man separate. While the Priest pronounces those words,
those who are invited to the Wedding do all light wax candles, and one of them gives the Priest,
a wooden Cup, or rather a Glass, full of Claret Wine which he takes off, and when the Married
Couple have pledg'd him by drinking it off, each of them three times, the Bridegroom
throws down the Cup or Glass, and he and the Bride treading it under their feet, break it to

pieces, with these words, May they thus fall at our feet, and be trod to pieces, who shall endeavour
to sow division or discontent between us. Then the Women cast at the young Couple some
Flax-seed and Hemp-seed, and wish them all prosperity. They also pull the Bride by the Robe,
as if they would force her away from her husband, but she keeps so close to him, that all their
endeavours prove fruitless. The Marriage-Ceremonies being thus over, the Bride is put into
her Sledge, which is encompass'd with six Torches, or Wax-candles, and the Bridegroom gets
on horse-back to return to his own house, where the Wedding is kept.
                  As soon as they are come thither, the Bridegroom, his kindred and friends sit down at a Table
well furnish'd with Meat, but the Women carry the Bride to her Chmber, take off her
cloaths, and lay her a-bed. That done, they make the Bridegroom rise from the Table, and
six or eight young men, carrying each a Torch in his hand, conduct him to the Chamber. As
they come in, they put the Torches into the barrels full of Wheat and Barley, and quit the
room. They are each of them presented with two Martins skins. The Bride perceiving the
Bridegroom coming, gets out of bed, gets on a morning Gown lin'd with Martins skins, meets
him, and receives him very submissively, doing him reverence with a low inclination of the
head; and this is the first time that he sees the Bride's face. They sit down together at a Table,
and, among other Meat, there is brought them a roasted fowl, which the Bridegroom
pulls asunder, casting away over his shoulders that part which comes off first, whether it be
wing or leg, and eating the other. Having eaten, the young Couple go to bed, and all withdraw,
save only one of the old servants of the house, who walks before the Chamber-door,
while the kindred and friends are busied about all manner of charms, which they think may be
advantageous to the New-married Couple.
                  This servant coming ever and anon to the door, asks whether the business be done. As soon
as the Bridegroom answers that it is, the Trumpets and Timbrels which only expect the word,
are plaid upon, and make an excellent noise, till such time as the stoves are made ready, where
the New-married-couple bath themselves, but apart. They are wash'd with water, Hydromel
and Wine, and the Bride sends to the Bridegroom a shirt, embroider'd with Gold and Pearls at
the collar and extremities, and a rich habit. The two next dayes are spent in entertainments,
dancing, and other divertisements, the Women making their advantage of the opportunity,
while their husbands are drunk, to the loss of their honours.
                  Citizens, and persons of meaner condition are married with less Ceremonie. The night before
the Wedding the young Man sends to his intended Bride some cloaths, a furr'd Coif, a
pair of Buskins, a Cabinet with certain Jewels, a Bag for night cloaths, a Comb and a Looking-glass.
The next day, the Priest is sent for, who comes with a little Silver Cross, and is
brought in by two young Lads carrying Wax-candles lighted. As he enters the house, he gives
the benediction with his Cross, first, to the two Lads, then to those that are invited. Then the
young Couple are set at Table, the two Lads holding a piece of Taffata between them; but
when the Suacha dresses the Brides head, a Looking-glass is brought, and the young Couple
joyning their cheeks, look and smile one upon the other. The two Suacha's in the mean time
cast hops upon them; which done, they are led to Church, where the Ceremonies are the same
as for persons of quality.
                  As soon as the Wedding is over,How the Women live. the Women must resolve to live a retir'd life, and not go
out of the house but very seldom, receiving the visits of their kindred and friends oftener than
they give any. The Daughters of great Persons, and rich Merchants, as they are not much
brought up to house-keeping, so they trouble themselves but little with it, when they are married.
Their chief employment is sowing, or embroidering handkerchers of white Taffata, or
cloath, or making little purses, or some such toies. The cloaths they wear within doors are
made of some common stuff of little value; but when they go to Church, or that their Husbands
would honour a friend with their presence, they are magnificently clad, and forget not to
paint their faces, necks, and arms.
                  The Wives of the Knez, Bojares, and great Lords, in the Summer time, make use of Chariots
cover'd with red cloath, which kind of covering they use in Winter for their Sledges, having
at their feet a she Save, and about them a great number of Servants and Lacquies, sometimes
to the number of 0. or 40. The horse, which draws them, hath many Fox tails about
the main and tail, which disguise him after a strange manner; and yet the Muscovits think it so
ornamental, that not only Great Lords and Ladies make use of it, but many times the Great
Duke himself, with this difference, that instead of Fox tails, they some times use Martins
skins.
                  The Women living thus idly,Their divertisement. making few or no visits, and not medling with any thing of
housewivery, are forc'd to divert themselves with their Maids. They lay a long plank over
a block, and getting up on the ends of it, they are toss'd up and down, and sometimes by a
violent motion they are forc'd up very high in the Air. They have also ropes to swing in;
nay in some little Towns and Villages I have seen publick Swinging-places, so contriv'd as
that three or four might have their divertisement at the same time. They are not asham'd to do

this in the open streets, giving two or three pence to little Boys who keep Swingers ready for
that purpose. Their husbands are very glad to give them this kind of sport, and sometimes help
them in their swinging.
                  It is not to be much wondred that they are so hardly treated by their husbands,Why the Muscovites beat their wives for they have
lewd tongues, are given to Wine, and will not let slip the opportunity to pleasure a friend. So
that having all these three excellent qualities, they cannot take much unkindly the cudgelings,
which they from time to time receive from their husbands: but they take comfort from the example
of their friends and neighbours, who, behaving themselves after the same manner, are
accordingly no better treated. Yet can I not believe, what Barclay says in his Icon Ammorum,
That the Muscovian Women are not perswaded their husbands love them, if they are not beaten
by them; at least I can say this, I never met with any who were glad when they were beaten.
They have the same passions and inclinations as other Women have. They are sensible of good
and bad usage, and it is not likely they should take the effects of anger and displeasure for expressions
of kindness and friendship.
                  It is possible some foolish Woman might tell her husband so in jest, or that one distracted
might desire to be beaten, such as she of whom Petrejus, in his Chronicle of Muscovy, speaks
of, who having lived many years in good correspondence with her husband (who was an Italian,
as he says, though the Baron of Haberstein affirms he was a German, and by profession,
a Black-smith, named Iordan) told him one day, that she could not believe he loved her, since
he had not yet beaten her. The husband willing to assure her of his real affection gave her a good
cudgelling, and perceiving she took a certain pleasure in it, made use of that exercise so often,
till at last she died. But were it granted that this is but a story, as it seems to be no other, yet
ought we not to judge of all the Muscovian women by this particular example.
                  They think,Adultery. that Adultry is not committed but when one man marries another mans wife:
what ever else may be done amounts but to fornication, and when a married man is taken in it,
his punishment is whipping, and some days imprisonment, or haply he is sentenc'd to live some
time on bread and water. Then he is set at liberty, and may resent the complaints made by his
wife against him upon that occasion. A husband who can convince his wife of a miscarriage of
this nature, may have her shav'd, and put into a Monastery. Those who are weary of their
wives, often make use of this pretence, accuse their wives of Adultery, and suborn false witnesses,
upon whose depositions they are condemn'd, without being heard. Religious Women
are sent to her lodgings, who put her into their habit, shave her, and carry her away by
force into the Monastery, whence she never comes out, having once suffer'd the Razour to
come upon her head.
                  The most ordinary cause of divorce; at least the most plausible pretence, is devotion. They
say, they love God better than their wives, when an humour takes them to go into a Monastery:
which they do without their consent, or making any provision for the children they have
had between them. And yet this kind of retiring out of the World is so much approv'd among
them, (though St. Paul says that such are worse than Heathens and Infidels) that if the woman
marry again, they make no difficulty to conferr Priesthood on this new Proselite, though before
he had been but a Tayler, or Shoemaker. Barrenness is also another cause of divorce in
Muscovy: for he who hath no children by his wife may put her into a Monastery, and marry
again within six weeks.
                  The Great Dukes themselves make use of this freedom, when they have only Daughters. 'Tis
true, the Great Duke Basili did not put his Wife Salome into a Monastery, and marry Helene,
daughter to Michael Linski, a Polander, but upon his having no Children one and twenty
years after marriage; but it is also true; that, some few days after, she was brought to bed of
a Son, and yet she was forc'd to continue there, because she had been shaved.
                  We saw an example of it in a Polander, who, having embrac'd the Greek Religion, purposely
to marry a Muscovian beauty, was forc'd to take a journey into Poland, where he stay'd above
a year. The young Lady, in her husband's absence, made a shift to be otherwise supply'd;
so effectually that she augmented her family by a child; but, fearing her husband's displeasure,
she retir'd into a Monastery and was shaved. The husband did all he could to get her out again,
promising to pardon her offence, and never to reproach her with it. The woman was willing
to come out, but would not be permitted, it being, according to their Theology, a sinne against
the Holy Ghost, not to be forgiven either in this World or the next. This artifice Boris
Federouits Gudenou made use of, who, having acquired much repute in the management of the
publick affairs, during the minority of Foedor Iuanouits, and perceiving the Muscovites were
not fully resolv'd to make him Great Duke, to make them the more earnest to do it, pretended
he would turn Monk, and went into a Monastery, where his Sister was a Nun. As soon
as the Muscovites heard of it, they came in multitudes to the Monastery, cast themselves upon
the ground, tore their hair, as being in a desperate condition, intreated him not to be shaven,
and that he would be pleas'd to take the place of their deceased Prince. He, at first, would
not hearken to them, but at last pretended himself overcome by their intreaties, and his Sister's

intercession, by which means he came to be courted, to what he had not haply got otherwise,
with all the subtlety he could have used.
                  The Muscovites are extremely venereous,Their superstition. yet will not have to do with a Woman, but they
must first take off the little Cross which is hang'd about her neck when she is Christened: nor
would they do it in a place where there are any Images of their Saints, till they had covered them.
They go not to Church the day they have dealt with a Woman, till they have wash'd themselves,
and chang'd their shirts. Those that are more devout go not into it at all, but say their
prayers at the door. Priests are permitted to come into the Church the same day, provided they
have wash'd themselves above and below the navil, but dare not approach the Altar. The women
are accompted more impure than the men, and therefore they ordinarily stay at the Churchdoor
all service time. He who lies with his wife in Lent may not Communicate that year; and
if a Priest commit that offence, he is suspended for a year: but if one that pretends to Priesthood
be so unhappy as to fall into it, he can never recover himself, but must quit his pretension.
                  Their remedy against this kind of uncleanness is rather bathing than repentance, which is the
reason they use the former upon all occasions. Demetrius, who personated the son of the Great
Duke Iohn Basilouits, who had been kill'd long before at Vglits, never bath'd himself, upon
which the Muscovites suspected him to be a stranger. For perceiving he would not make use
of a bath made ready for him eight dayes after his marriage, they conceiv'd a horror against him,
as a Heathen and profane person, sought divers other pretences, set upon him in the Castle, and
kill'd him the 19. day after his Wedding, as we shall shew hereafter.
                  The politick Government of Muscovy is Monarchical and despotical.The Government of Muscovy. The Great Duke is the
hereditary Soveraign of it, and so absolute, that no Knez or Lord in all his Dominions, but
thinks it an honour to assume the quality of his Majesties Golop, or slave. No Master hath more
power over his slaves, than the Great Duke hath over his Subjects, what condition or quality
soever they be of. So that Muscovy may be numbred among those States, whereof Aristotle
speaks, when he sayes there is a kind of Monarchy among the Barbarians which comes near
Tyranny. For since there is no other difference between a legitimate Government and Tyranny,
than that, in the one, the welfare of the Subjects is of greatest consideration, in the other, the
particular profit and advantage of the Prince, we must allow, that Muscovy inclines much to
Tyranny. We said before, that the greatest Lords think it not below them to put their names
in the diminutive; nor is it long since that for a small matter, they were whipt, like slaves, but
now their lesser miscarriages are punish'd with two or three dayes imprisonment.
                  They give their Soveraign the quality of Welikoi Knez,The  signification of the word Czaar. that is Great Lord, as also that of
Czaar, and his Czaarick Majesty. Since the Muscovites came to understand, that we call him
Kayser, who is the most eminent among the Christian Princes of Europe, and that that word
comes from his proper name; who turn'd the Popular state of Rome into a Monarchy, they
would have it believ'd, that their word Czaar, hath the same signification and etymologie.
Whence it is that they would also imitate the Emperours of Germany in their great seal,The Czaar's Arms. which
had a Spread-Eagle, but the wings not so large as the Imperial Eagle's, having on the breast, in
an Escutcheon, one on hors-back fighting with a Dragon, representing the Archangel St. Michael,
or rather St. George. The three Crowns, which are above and between the Eagle's heads,
signifie Muscovy, and the two Kingdoms of Tartary, Cassan, and Astrachan. The Tyrant Iohn
Basilouits first used these Arms, as willing to be thought descended from the antient Roman Emperours.
The Great Dukes Interpreters, and the Germans, who live at Moscou, call him in
their language Kaysar, that is to say, Caesar or Emperour. But it is certain, the word Czaar
signifies King, which may be seen in their Bible, where the Muscovites, speaking of David and
his Successors, Kings of Iudah, and Israel, they call them Czaars. The Great Duke is indeed
King in effect, since other Princes stick not to treat him with the word Majesty; the title of
Great Duke being much below what that great Prince deserves. Nor accordingly does he take
the quality of Great Duke, when he assumes that of of Welikoi Knez, but that of Grand Seigneur,
as well as the Emperour of the Turks, with whom he may be parallel'd, not only in respect
of the extent of his Empire, but also by reason of the absolute power he hath over his
Subjects.
                  No people in the World have a greater veneration for their Prince than the Muscovites,
who from their infancy are taught to speak of the Czaar, as of God himself, not only in their
acts and publick assemblies, but also in their entertainments and ordinary discourse. Thence proceed
their submissive forms of speaking, The honour to see the brightness of the eyes of his Czaarick
Majesty; Only God and the Czaar knows it; All they have belong to God and the Czaar. The
Great Duke Iohn Basilouits reduc'd them to these submissions.
                  Now to continue them in this lowness of spirit,The Muscovites know not what liberty is. and to keep them from seeing that liberty
/which other Nations about them enjoy, the Muscovites are, upon pain of death, prohibited to
go out of the Countrey, without the Great Duke's express permission. Iohn Helmes, the
Great Duke's Interpreter, who died some three years since, aged 97. years, had got leave to

send his son into Germany, to study Physick, where he afterwards grew famous: but the young
Gentleman having spent 10. or 12. years up and down Germany and England, pleas'd with the
sweetness of the climate and liberty, would never return into Muscovy. Whence it came, that,
when Peter Miklaf, a Merchant of Novogorod, whom the Great Duke sent into Germany,
3 years since, in the quality of Poslanick, desired his Majesty would permit him to leave his son
in Germany, neither the Czaar, nor Patriarch, would by any means consent thereto. But indeed,
this despotical Government seems to be most suitable to their humour and disposition,
which is insensible of the advantages of Liberty, as being unacquainted with it, and so not fit to
enjoy a happiness, which they never heard of.
                  Yet are we not to attribute to the present time what may be read in the Baron of Hbrstein,
Paulus Iovius and Guagnin, concerning the violent and tyrannical Government of the Great
Duke: for they writ during the reign of Iohn Basilouits, whose Scepter was of Iron, and his
Government more cruel and violent than that of any Prince mentioned in History. But the
Great Duke that now is, is a very mild Prince, one that, according to his Father's example, instead
of impoverishing his Subjects, relieves them, and allows sums of money out of his Exchequer,
to set up those whom a bad year, or some other misfortune hath ruin'd. Nay, he hath
the goodness to provide for such as are banish'd into Siberia for their Crimes, allowing to persons
of quality, money; finding employment for those that are capable of it; and disposing
Soldiers into some place where they have Pensions or ordinary pay during life. So that what is
most insupportable to them, when they are out of favour, is, that they have not the honour to
see the bright eyes of his Czaarick Majesty. For, were it no for that, this is become so mild
a punishment, that many have, in their exile, got that wealth, which they could not have hoped
before.
                  When we said the state of Muscovy was Monarchical;The Great Dukes absolute power. we presuppose that the Prince is a
Monarch, and hath, alone, all the prerogatives of Soveraignty. He is not subject to the Laws;
he only makes them, and all the Muscovites obey him, with so great submission, that they
are so far from opposing his will, that they say, the Justice and word of their Prince is sacred
and inviolable.
                  He only creates Magistrates, and deposes them, ejects them, and orders them to be punish'd,
with such absolute power, that we may say of the Great Duke, what the Prophet Daniel says,
of the King of Babylon, That, he put to death whom he would, and saved whom he would. He
appoints Governours and Lieutenants for the Provinces, for the disposal of the antient Demesn,
and Administration of Justice, who have, joyned with them, a Deak, or Secretary: and
these take Cognizance of all matters, give final and absolute judgement in all causes, and cause
their sentences to be put in execution, without any appeal.
                  And in this the Great Duke follows the advice of the best Politicians,Changes the Governours of Provinces every three years. who are so far from
allowing a survivancy in Governments, that they would have a Soveraign, (that it might be
in his power to punish the miscarriages committed by great ones in their Governments, and
prevent their making intrigues to settle themselves in the Provinces) to change the Governours
from three years to three years.
                  He alone hath the power to make War and Peace with other Princes. For though he takes
the advice of his Knez and Bojares, yet does he not always follow it, but makes them know,
that notwithstanding the freedom he gives them to advise him, he reserves to himself the power
of doing what he thinks fit.
                  He only confers Honours, and rewards the services that are done him with the qualities of
Knez, Bojares, Dukes or Princes; and whereas the Muscovites have heard, that it is a mark
of Soveraignty in Germany, to make Doctors, the Great Duke meddles with that also, and
grants Letters Patents to Physicians and Surgeons, that are Strangers.
                  All the Great Duke's Mony,Tee Money of Muscovy who only hath the power to make any, is of Silver, of an oval
form, and little. The greatest piece is worth but a peny, and is called a Copec, or Denaing.
For though, in trading, the Muscovites use the words, Altin, Grif, and Rouble, whereof
the first is worth three; the second, ten; the third, a hundred Copecs, yet is there no Coins
of that kind, the words being used only for the convenience of Commerce, to avoid the multiplication
of Copecs. The Poluske is worth half, the Mustofske, the fourth part of a Copec.
This small mony, which is also of Silver, is so troublesome in the telling and handling, that
the Muscovites put handfuls of it into their mouths, for fear of losing it, but so as it no way
hinders their speech. All their Money is marked at the same corner, having on one side the
Arms of Mascovy, of which we have spoken upon occasion of their Great Seal, which Armes
were heretofore peculiar only to the City of Novogorod, and on the other the Great Duke's
name then reigning, and that of the City where it was coined. There are but four Cities in all
Muscovy where mony is coined, Moscou, Novogorod, Tuere, and Plesco: The Great Duke
farming out the Mint to the Merchants of those places. Rixdollers are current in Muscovy; but
in regard two Dollers outweigh a hundred Copecs, by two drams, the Muscovites know how
to make their advantage of it, and so carry them to the Mint, as they do also Spanish Reals.
                  
                     
The Rixdollers they call Iamske, from the modern Latin word Ioachimicus, which name
hath been given that money, as well by reason of the effigies of St. Ioachim, heretofore stamped
upon it, as of the City of Iaachimstad, in Bohemia, where it was first coined; in the year
1519. The Great Duke coins no Gold, unless it be, that to perpetuate the memory of some
gread advantage gain'd against his enemies, he hath some Medals cast, to be afterwards
presented to Officers that are Strangers, or to be scattered among the Souldiers of the victorious
Army.
                  He only levies Taxes and impositions, and regulates them according to his pleasure, so as
that he takes five in the hundred upon all Merchandizes, upon the Frontiers of his Dominions,
both coming and going out.
                  It is his prerogative to send Ambassadors,Muscovian Ambassadours. to the Emperour, the Kings of Poland, Denmark,
Sueden, and other Princes his Neighbours. These Ministers are either Welikoi Posol, Grand
Courriers, or Poslanicks, Envoys. Heretofore, especially in the time of Iohn Basilouits, they
treated Strangers, even the publick Ministers of Princes, with much disrespect; but now it is
otherwise. Ambassadors are entertain'd with great civility; and their charges defray'd from
the day of their entrance into the Great Duke's Dominions, to that of their departure thence;
they are treated at great feasts, and have very rich Presents bestow'd on them. Whence it comes,
that other Europaean Princes make no difficulty to send their Ambassadors thither, nay some
have their ordinary Residents there, as the Kings of England and Sueden. All the Presents
made by the Great Duke consist in Furrs, and he never sends any solemn Embassy, but it carries
such as are very considerable for the Prince to whom it is sent. Those which the Great Duke
Foedor Iuanouits sent, in the year 1595. to the Emperour Rodolph II. were very remarkable,A remarkable Present.
which amounted to above a Million of Livers, or 100000. sterl. viz. onethousand and three
Zimmers (which we have said elsewhere, makes twenty pair, and in worth about 100.
Crowns in Muscovy) of Sables, five hundred and nineteen Zimmers of ordinary Martins, sixscore
black-Fox-skins, three hundred thirty seven thousand ordinary Fox-skins, three thousand
Beavers, a thousand Wolf-skins, and sixty four Elk's-skins. The Poslanicks make no
Present from the Great Duke, but upon their own account they do, as baits to draw in others,
and if they are not given them, they will have the boldness to ask for them. They defray foreign
Ambassadors, not only as to provisions, but also provide for the carriage of them, and
what ever they bring; and there are upon the Road appointed stages for the accommodation of
their travelling, where the Peasants are oblig'd to be ready with a certain number of Horses,
and to come upon the first order sent them. Nor is this done with any grievance to those Peasants;
for besides a salary of 60 Crowns per an. duly paid them, they have land enough allow'd
them for their subsistence. They are freed from Taxes, and all other Charges, and have
the allowance of some Altins every journey they make. By this means we travell'd from Novogorod
to Moscou, above 120. German leagues, in six or seven days, and in the Winter in
four or five. 'Tis true, the Houses where the Ambassadors are lodg'd, are so poorly furnish'd,
that unless a man will be content to ly on the ground or upon a bench, he must bring a Bed with
him: but the Muscovites themselves are no better accomodated. Heretofore they shut up the
Ambassadors and their retinue in their lodgings, kept them in as Prisoners, and set Sentinels at
the door to hinder them from coming out; or if they permitted some of their people to go abroad
into the City, they were accompany'd by Strelits, who observed all their actions: but
now they are kept in only till the first Audience, and in the mean they are visited and entertain'd
by two Pristafs, whose office it is, to see them supply'd with all things necessary. These take
occasion to ask the Ambassadors, what the design of their Embassy is, as also to inform themselves
whether they have any Presents for the Great Duke, and in what they consist, not forgetting
to ask whether they have also any for them. As soon as the Ambassadors have delivered
in their Presents, the Great Duke causes them to be valu'd by persons that know their worth.
Heretofore, the Ambassadors were entertain'd, after their first publick Audience, in the Great
Duke's Chamber, at his own Table; but some years since this custom was abolish'd, and they
send, to their Lodgings, the Meat design'd for their treatment. All Ambassadors who bring
Presents thither, receive others for themselves and their retinue; nay they give Presents to
Gentlemen who come thither as Envoys, and to all those that bring but so much as a Letter
from a forein Prince. To make a fuller discovery of the Political Government of Muscovy, it
will not be much from our purpose, by a short digression, to give an account of what hath
pass'd there within this three hundred years.
                  The Great Duke Iohn Basilouits, Son of Basili, came to the Crown very young, in the year
1540.An Epitmy of the History of Muscovy. Juan Basilouits. No History of his time, but speak of his Wars, and the un-heard of cruelties exercis'd
by him on all sorts of persons, through his whole reign. They are so horrid, that never any
other Tyrant did the like; so that Paulus Iovius, a Bishop, might have forborn giving him
that noble quality, of a Good and Devout Christian; since that it may, without any injury to
him, be said, he deserves not to be numbred even among Men. 'Tis true, he would go often
to Church, say the Service himself, sing, and be present at Ecclesiastical Ceremonies, and

execute the Functions of Monks and Priests: but he abus'd both God and Men, and had not
sentiments of humanity, so far was he from having any of piety. He had seven lawful wives,
and by the first, two sons, Iuan and Foedor, that is, Iohn and Theodore. Being once very angry
with the elder, he struck him over the head with a staff hoop'd with iron at the end, so as
that within five days after he died of it. He had by the last, Demetrius, and dy'd the 28 of
March 1584. feeling at his death some part of those afflictions, which an infinite number of
innocent persons had suffered through his means.
                  Foedor Iuanouits, now eldest by his Brother's death, was crown'd the last of Iuly, the same
year. He was 22 years of age when he succeeded his Father, but had so little understanding,
that, being not fit for affairs, the administration thereof, with the Regency of the whoe
Kingdom was conferr'd on Boris Gudenou, High-Steward of Muscovy, and Brother in law to
the Great Duke, Salomon Henning, in his Chronicle of Livonia, says, that this Foedor was
so simple, that he could find himself no greater divertisement than tolling of the Bells before
Service.
                  On the contrary, Boris Gudenou knew so well how to answer the good opinion conceived of
him, and to insinuate himself into the affection of the people, that some stuck not to say, that
if God should be pleased to dispose otherwise of the two hereditary Princes, it was not to be
doubred, but they would call in him, who gave so many demonstrations of an excellent conduct.
During the regency, Boris, perceiving that Demetrius was the more likely to stand in
his way, resolv'd to remove him out of it. This young Prince was but nine years old, brought
up in the City of Vglits, whither a Gentleman belonging to Boris went, and kill'd him with
his own hands. But instead of receiving the great reward he expected for his pains, Boris caus'd
him and all the Complices to be kill'd as soon as they were return'd to Moscou. By this execution
of the Murtherers, he, for some time, kept undiscovered the true Author of the murther:
but, to prevent the people from conceiving him any way engag'd in it, by giving them a
greater cause of affliction, he caus'd several houses to be set a-fire, and so consum'd a great part
of the City; while, on the other side, he ordered the Castle of Vglits to be demolish'd, and
banish'd the Inhabitants, as if they had countenanc'd the murther, and sheltred the murtherers.
The weakness of Foedor Iuanouits, sensible, though of nothing else, yet of his own weakness,
left the management of all affairs, to Boris, who was in effect what the other had only the
name and appearance of, yet did he not think it fit to be over-forward, but let some years pass
on, after which, Foedor fell suddenly sick, in the year 1597. and died without children, having
reigned twelve years.
                  Boris was presently look'd upon.Boris Gudenou. He, to divert the popular jealousie, was so crafty, as, in
appearance, to refuse the Royal Dignity, and, as we have said before, to fly into a Monastery,
while his Election to the Dukedom was, according to his secret instructions, press'd by some
friends, by whose opportunity he seem'd to be overcome, and to accept the Crown.
                  In the reign of Boris happened a very remarkable thing, through the imposture of a Muscovian
Monk, named Griska Vtropoja, born at Gereslau, of a Noble house, but not very rich, one
that had been thrust into a Monastery for his debauches, and lew'd life. He was a very handsome
person, and had an excellent Wit, which qualities an old Monk of the same Monastery
made his advantage of, to put this Impostor into the World, and advance him to the Throne.
The better to carry on his design, he made him leave the Monastery, and go into Lithuania,
where he was entertain'd by a Great Lord, named Adam Wesnewetski, into whose favour he in
a short insinuated himself, by his ingenuity, and the constancy of his services. One day his Master
being angry with him, call'd him Bledinsin, or Son of a Whore, and struck him. Griska
making his advantage of that disgrace, fell a weeping, and told his Master, that if he knew who
he was, he would not call him Son of a Whore, nor treat him in that manner. The curiosity of
the Polish Lord was so great, as to press Greska to tell him who he was. The Impostor made answer,
that he was lawful Son to the Great Duke Iohn Basilouits, that Boris Gudenou would have
murther'd him, but the misfortune fell upon a Priest's Son very like him, whom his friends had
substituted in his place, while he was convey'd away. He thereupon shews a golden Cross beset
with precious stones, which he said was hung about his neck at his Baptism. Adding that the
fear of falling into the hands of Boris Gudenou had kept him from discovering himself till then.
Upon which he casts himself at his Lords feet, and intreats him to take him into his protection,
enlivening his relation with so many circumstances, and his actions with so much shew of sincerity,
that his Master, perswaded he spoke nothing but truth, immediately furnish'd him with
Cloaths, Horses, and attendance befitting the greatness of a Prince of that quality. The noise
of it spreads over all the Country, finds credit every where, and the presumption grows so much
the stronger, by reason the Great Duke Boris Gudenou proffers a great sum of mony, to any that
should bring in that counterfeit Demetrius alive or dead. His Master, not thinking him safe at
his house, sends him into Poland, where he is receiv'd by the Weywode of Sandomira, who promises
him a sufficient assistance to restore him to his Throne, upon condition he would tolerate
the Roman Catholick Religion in Muscovy, as soon as he had setled himself in the Government

thereof. Demetrius not only accepted of that condition, but, being secretly instructed, chang'd
his Religion, and promised to marry the Weywode's Daughter, as soon as he should be establish'd.
The hope of so advantageous an allyance, and the zeal the Weywode had for his Religion,
engag'd him to employ his credit and friends, by whose means he got together a considerable
Army, enter'd Muscovy, and declared a War against the Great Duke. He took in several
Cities, debauch'd and corrupted most of the Officers employ'd by Boris against him, and grew
so prosperous, that the grief Boris conceived thereat struck him so to the heart, that he died of
it, Apr. 13. 1605. The Knez and Bojars, who were at Moscou, immediately caused his Son
Foedor Borissouits to be crowned,Foedor Borissouits. though very young: but reflecting on the continual success of
Demetriu's Arms, their minds chang'd, and deriving, from his victories, an ill presage against
the new Great Duke, they concluded, that he must be the true Demetrius, the lawful Son of
Iohn Basilouits, and that they did ill to take up arms against their natural Sovereign. It was no
hard matter to insinuate this into the people, who presently cry'd, Live Demetrius, true Heir
of the Kingdom, and may his Enemies perish. Whereupon they ran to the Castle, seis'd upon
the young Great Duke, imprison'd him, ransacked, misused, and forc'd away all the kindred
and friends of Boris Gudenou, and at the same time sent to intreat Demetrius to come as soon as
he pleas'd, and take possession of the Kingdom of his Ancestors. They also begg'd his pardon
for what they had done through ignorance, upon the instigation of Boris, assured him of their
affection and obedience, and as a pledge of their fidelity, they profer'd to put into his hands the
deceased Duke's Son, his Mother, and all his Family, to be disposed of as he should think it.
Upon these overtures Demetrius sent a Deak, or Secretary named Iuan Bogdanou, with order
to strangle the Mother and Son, and to give out that they were poison'd. Which was accordingly
executed the 10. of Iune 1605. in the second moneth of the reign of Foedor Borissouits.
                  The 16. of the same moneth,A counterfeit Demetrius. Demetrius came to Moscou, with his Army, which strangely
encreased as he came along. The whole City went out to meet him, and made him Presents.
He was Crown'd the 21. of Iuly, with extrtordinary Ceremonies. And that there might be no
question made of the lawfulness of his birth, he sent for the Mother of the true Demetrius,
whom Boris Gudenou had shut up in a Monastery, at a great distance from Moscou. He went to
meet her with a Noble retinue of Courtiers, lodg'd her in the Castle, where he caused her to
be treated with all magnificence, visiting her every day, and doing her all the honour a Mother
could expect from a Son. The good Lady knew well enough, that Demetrius, her Son, had
been kill'd, but she cunningly dissembled it, as well out of the resentment she had against the
memory of Boris Gudenou, and the fear she was in to be ill-treated by this counterfeit Demetrius,
as for that she was not a little pleas'd to see her self so much honour'd, and enjoy the sweetness
of a happy life, after the miseries and afflictions she had endured in the Monastery, since her
Son's death.
                  But when the Muscovites found his manner of life different from that of the Great Dukes his
predecessors,A conspiracy against the counterfeit Demetrius, that he was resolv'd to marry a Roman Catholick, the Weywode of Sandomiria's
daughter, and ransack'd the Treasuries of the Kingdom to furnish her according to the advancement
she expected, they began to mistrust him, and to perceive they had been mistaken. One of
the principal Knez, named Vasili Zuski, was the first that offer'd to speak of it to some other
Lords, as well Ecclesiastical as Secular, and to remonstrate to them the danger whereto both
the State and Religion were expos'd, by the Alliance which that Counterfeit intended to make
with a strange woman, and of a contrary Religion; adding, that, of necessity, he was an Impostor,
and a lewd person. Upon this it was resolv'd he should be dispatch'd out of the way:
but the Conspiracy being discover'd, and Zuski taken, Demetrius got him sentenc'd to death,
but sent him a pardon upon the point of execution, hoping by that mildness, to gain the affection
of the Muscovites. Accordingly all was quiet till the day of his marriage, which was the
8. of May, 1606. The Bride being arriv'd, with a great number of Poles, Armed, and in a
capacity to become Masters of the City, the Muscovites began to open their eyes. Zuski got
to his own house, several Knez and Bojares, propos'd to their consideration the present State of
Affairs, the unavoidable ruine of both State and Religion, and, profer'd, for the preservation
thereof, once more to expose his person and life. They gave him thanks, and promis'd to assist
him with their Persons and Estates, when there should be an opportunity to put their design in
execution. They had a fair one the last day of the Nuptial solemnity, which was the ninth after
the Wedding, and the 17. of May. The Great Duke and his Company being got drunk
and asleep, the Muscovites caused all the Bells in the City to be rung, as they are wont in case
of fire, to give an Alarm, whereupon they immediately put themselves into Arms, and set upon
the Castle, where, having defeated the Polish Guards, and forc'd the Gates, they entred
the Great Dukes Chamber, who thought to avoid present death by leaping out at a window into
the Court, in hope to save himself among the Guards, which were still there in Arms: but
he was taken, and cruelly us'd. The Castle was ransack'd. Zuski, addressing himself to the
pretended Mother of Demetrius, oblig'd her to swear by the Cross, whether Demetrius was her

Son, or no, to which having answer'd, that he was not, and that she never had but one Son,
who had been unfortunately murther'd, they shot the Counterfeit Demetrius in the head with
a Pistol.Demetrius kill'd. They imprison'd the pretended Great Dutchess, with her Father and Brother, as also
the Polish Ambassador. The Ladies and Gentlewomen were abus'd and deflour'd, and above
1700. men kill'd, among whom were many Jewellers, Merchants, who had abundance of
Jewels about them. Demetrius's body was stripp'd, and dragg'd to the place before the Castle,
where it lay expos'd for three whole days. After which they buried it, but it was immediately
taken up again, to be burnt, and reduc'd to ashes.
                  This conspiracy thus succeeding, the Muscovites chose into the place of Demetrius, Knez
Basilouits Zuski,Zuski made Great Duke. A second counterfeit Demetrius. the Ring-leader of the Enterprise, who was Crown'd Iune 1. 1606. But he
was no sooner got into the Throne, ere another Impostor disputed the possession of it. His name
was Knez Gregori Schacopski, who at the pillaging of the Castle, having found the Seals of the
Kingdom, fell into a League with two Polauders, and made a shift to go into Poland. He made
use of the same invention as his Predecessor, and took the name of Demetrius, giving out, where
he came, that he had escap'd the Massacre, in the night time, that they had kill'd another in
his stead, and that he was going into Poland to raise another Army, to punish the Muscovites
for their infidelity and ingratitude.
                  About the same time started up another Demetrius,A third Impostor. in the City of Moscou. He was Clerk
to one of the Secretaries of State, got into the field, made use of the same imposture as the two
others, and found abetters, by whose assistance he became Master of many great Cities. This
occasion'd many other disorders, which the Polanders countenanc'd out of their resentment of
the affront they had receiv'd from the Muscovites. The events of the War, occasioned thereby,
prov'd so fatal and unhappy, that the Muscovites quarrell'd at Zuski, and look'd upon
him as the sole cause of all their misfortunes. They said, his Government was unjust, because
unfortunate, and that there must needs be something fatal in his person, when victory seem'd
to shun him, to side with his Enemies. Three Muscovian Lords, Zacchary Lippanow, Michael
Molsaneck, and Iuan Kesefski, were the first that amus'd the people with these reports,
and, perceiving they were well receiv'd among them, proceeded in their design, depriv'd Zuski
of his Dignity, shut him up in a Monastery, and had him shaved.
                  Upon this, the Knez and Bojares, to avoid the jealousie, which the Election might raise among
themselves, resolv'd to take in a forein Prince. The Polanders still countenanc'd the second
Demetrius, so far as that they forc'd the former's Widow to acknowledge him for her
husband, and expected satisfaction for the affront they had received at Moscou, at the marriage
of Demetrius, so that the Muscovites willing to satisfie the Polanders, and not finding any
Prince near them so well qualified as Vladislaus,Uladislaus Prince of Poland chosen Czaar of Muscovy. eldest son to Sigismond King of Poland, sent
to the King, his father, to desire, that he might accept of the Crown of Muscovy. The King
consented; but the Treaty agreed upon, among other Clauses, had this, that Iohn Basilouits
Zuski should be taken out of the Monastery, and, with some other Lords of his Kinred, should
be put into the hands of the King of Poland, who kept them, a long time, Prisoners at Smolensko,
where Zuski, at last, died, and his body was buried near the High-way, between Thorn
and Warsaw. Stanilaus Solkouski was, in the mean time, advanc'd with his Army to the very
Gates of Moscou, with order to revenge the death of Demetrius, and the Polanders, who were
Massacred with him. But news coming of the conclusion of the Treaty, they laid down their
Arms, and Stanislaus had order, in the Prince's name, to receive homage from the Muscovites,
and to stay at Moscou, till the Prince were come thither in person. The Muscovites
were content, and, having taken the Oath of Allegiance, they reciprocally administred it to
him, and permitted him, with a thousand Poles, to enter the Castle, and to keep a Garrison
there. The rest of the Army stay'd without the City, not doing any thing at which the
Muscovites might conceive any jealousie. On the contrary, there was much kindness shewn on
both sides, till that the Poles, having crept by degeees into the City, to the number of above
six thousand, took up the Avenues of the Castle for their quarters, and began to incommodate
the Citizens, and to become insupportable, by reason of their insolences, and the violences
they dayly committed upon Women and Maids,The Muscovites discontented against the Polanders. nay, upon the Muscovian Saints, at which
they shot off their Pistols. So that the Muscovites not able to endure them any longer, and
impatient for their Great Duke, met together on the 24. of Ianuary 1611. in the place before
the Castle, where they made a noise, and complained of the outrages which they daily received
from the Polanders, saying, it was impossible for them to maintain so great a number of
Soldiers, that their Trade was destroy'd, that they were exhausted to the least drop of their
blood, that the new Great Duke came not, which made them apprehend, there was something
ominous in it; that they could live no longer at that rate, and that they should be forc'd
to those remedies, which nature had furnish'd them with, for their safety, if some other
course were not taken.
                  The Polish General did all he could to appease them,An insurrection at Moscou. causing to be severely punish'd some of
his Soldiers who most deserv'd it; but the Muscovites thought not that enough. The Polanders,

                     
                     

                     
on their side??? fearing a general insurrection, doubled their Guards, possess'd themselves of the
Principal streets, and prohibited the Muscovites to assemble, and bear Arms. This incens'd
them so, as that they all rose, and met together in several places of the City, purposely to oblige
the Polanders to divide their forces. The Polanders thought it not enough to stand only upon
the defensive, but set the City on fire in three or four several places, thereby obliging the
Muscovites to run to the relief of their Wives and Children, and making their advantage of
that calamity, they set upon the Muscovites where ever they met them, and made so horrid a
slaughter of them, that it is said, the sword and the fire destroy'd, in those two dayes, above
200000. persons, and all the houses in the City, excepting the Castle, the Churches, and some
few stone-buildings. The Great Duke's Treasury was ransack'd, as also the Churches and
Monasteries, out of which the Polanders got, and sent into Poland, an incredible quantity of
Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, among which, the Muscovites do, to this day, regret the
loss of a certain Vnicorn's horn, enrich'd with Diamonds. They say, the Soldiery got such a
booty, that some of them charg'd their Pistols with great round Pearls. Fifteen dayes after
this disorder came Zachary Listpenow with a good Army, and besig'd the Polanders in the Castle,
kill'd many of them in several assaults, and, at last, forc'd them to a composition, and to
depart the Kingdom.
                  The Muscovites,Michael Federouits chosen Great Duke. having weather'd out all these calamities, proceeded to the Election of a
new Great Duke, and chose Michael Foederouits, the son of Foedor Nikitis, a Kinsman, but far
remov'd, of Iuan Basilouits. This man had forsaken his wife, for God's sake, as they call it, and became
a Religious man, whereupon he was made Patriarch, and, in that dignity, chang'd the
name of Foedor, into that of Philaretes. The Son, who was of a very good nature, and much
inclin'd to Devotion, hath alwayes express'd a great respect for his Father, taking his advice in
affairs of greatest importance, and giving him the honour of admittance to all publick Audiences
and Ceremonies, at which he alwayes gave him precedence. He died in the year 1633. some
few dayes before our first Embassy.
                  The first thing this new Great Duke did, after his establishment, was, to make a Peace with
his Neighbour Princes, and to abolish the memory of his Predecessors Cruelties, by so mild a
Government, that it is granted, Muscovy hath not had, these many ages, a Prince deserving so
great commendations from his Subjects. He died Iuly 12. 1645. in the 49th??? year of his age,
and the 33. of his reign. The Great Dutchess, his Wife, died eight dayes after him, and his
son, Knez Alexei Michalouits succeeded him.
                  The reign of Michael Foederouits was very quiet. But as, in the times of Boris Gudenou, and
Iohn Basilouits Zuski, there were Counterfeit Demetrius's, so, in Michael's time, there started
up an Impostor, who had the boldness, to assume the name and and quality of Basili Iouanouits
Zuski,A counterfeit Zuski??? Son of a Linnen-Draper. Son to the Great Duke Iuan Basilouits Zuski. His name was Timoska Ankudina,
born in the City of Vologda, in the Province of the same name, and son to a Linnen. Draper, named
Demko, or Dementi Ankudina. The Father having observ'd somewhat of more than ordinary
wit in him, had brought him up to writing and reading, which having attain'd, he was
look'd upon as a very excellent person among those who have no further acquaintance with
Learning.His first preferment The excellency of his voice, and his skill in singing Hymns at Church, recommended
him to the Arch-Bishop of the place, who took him into his service, wherein Ankudina behaved himself so well, that the Arch-Bishop having a kindness for him, married him to a Grand-Child
of his. This Allyance, which might have been very advantageous to him, prov'd the
first occasion of his ruine: for he presently began, in his Letters, to assume the quality of Son-in-law
to the Weywode of Vologda, and Vellicopermia. Having, after the Arch-bishops death,
squander'd away his Wife's fortune, he came, with his Family, to Moscou, where, upon the
recommendation of a friend of the Arch-bishop's, he found an employment in the Novazetvert,
that is, the Office where such as keep common Tip-ling-houses are oblig'd to take the Wine,
Strong-water, and Hydromel, which they sell by retail, ad where they give an accompt of
what they have spent. He was made Receiver there, but became so unfaithful, that, the first
Accompt he made he could not bring in what was due to the Prince, by 200. Crowns: and in
regard they expect a great exactness upon such an accompt in Muscovy, he put his invention
upon the rack to make up the said sum.Cheats his fellow Officer. To that end, he went to one of his fellow Officers, named
Basili Gregorowits Spilki, who had Christen'd a Child of his, and done him several kindnesses,
when occasion required, and told him, that one of the chiefest Merchant of Vologda,
one to whom he was very much oblig'd, being come to the City, he had invited him to Dinner,
and would be glad to let him see his Wife; intreating him to lend him his Wife's Pearls and
Rings, that he might present her in a condition suitable to his employment. The other did it
without any difficulty, nay, without any thing to shew from the other, of his having receiv'd
them, though they were worth above 1000. Crowns. But Timoska, instead of pawning the
Jewels to make up his accompts, sold them, made use of the money, and confidently averr'd
that his friend had not lent him any. Spilki clapt him up in prison, but, having no evidence to
convict him, he could not hinder his being set at liberty, Timoska had some difference with his

Wife, who often reproach'd him with his perfidiousness, and other vices, especially his Sodomy:
so that fearing, on the one side, to be called to accompt for what he was in arrear to the
Prince, and, on the other, that his Wife might happly be the first that should accuse him, bethought
him one day to send his son to a friend of his,Burns his wife, and retreats into Poland. to shut up his Wie in a stove, and to set
the house a-fire, in which his Wife was burnt. Having done thus, he went into Poland, but so secretly,
that it was thought at Moscou, the same fire had consumed him, with the rest of his family.
                  Timoska went away, about the latter end of the year 1643. but hearing, in 1645. that the
Greak Duke was to send an Ambassador to the King of Poland, and that his being at the Court
of Warsaw was known in Muscovy,Goes to Chmielniski. he went in the year 1646 to Chmielniski, General of the
Cosaques, and begg'd his protection, against the persecutions which he suffer'd, upon no other
accompt than this, that the Great Duke knew him to be a near kinsman to the Prince Iuan Basilouits
Zuski. He had wit enough to carry on the Imposture, and had got such an influence over
Chmielniski, that he began to grow considerable, when a Muscovian Poslanik, named Iacob
Koslou, who had been sent to this Cosaque General, knew him, and advis'd him to return to
Moscou, and endeavour, to make up the sum which was due from him to the Great Duke,
which was not so great, but, that having paid it, the intercession of his friends might easily get
his pardon: for it was not yet known, that he pretended to be son to the Great Duke Iohn Basilouits
Zuski. But this course he thought not safe, and, fearing he might be secur'd, he went,
in the year 1648.Turns Turk to Constantinople, where he abjur'd the Christian Religion, and was circumcised.
He stay'd not long there, but, fearing to be punish'd for some Crimes he had committed
there also, he went into Italy, and so to Rome,Becomes a Roman Catholick. Goes into Sueden. where he became a Roman Catholick. Thence
he went in the year 1650. to Vienna, and thence into Transilvania, to Prince Ragotskie, who
gave him Letters of recommendation to Queen Christina, of Sueden. This Princes receiv'd him
kindly, and giving credit to what he related, allowed him an honourable subsistence. The
Muscovian Merchants, who were then at Stockholm, soon acquainted the Great Duke with
this man's Imposture, who stuck not to give out every where, that he was son to Iohn Basilouits
Zuski. The Great Duke immediately sent thither the aforesaid Koslou, who had seen him with
Chmielniski, to desire the Queen to deliver up that man to him: but Timoska, who knew that
enquiry would be made for him, was already got away. His man, whose name was Kostka, or
Constantine, whom some business had detain'd after his Master at Stockholm, was taken, and
sent, well chain'd, to Muscovy, where they found Timoska's Mother and Kinred, whereof
some were put to the Rack and executed. Timoska was taken at Reuel, in Livonia, by order
from the Queen of Sueden; but he made a shift to get out of prison, and went, by the way of
Holland,To Brussels. to Brussels, where he saw the Arch-Duke Leopold. Thence he went to Wittenberg,
and to Leipsig, where he made profession of the Lutheran Religion, and Writ, himself, his
Confession of Faith in Latin.Embraces the Lutheran religion Thence he went to Noustadt, in the Dutchy of Holstein, where
Peter Miklaf, who had brought Letters from the Great Duke to the Duke of Holstein, got him
secur'd. He was carried thence to Gottorp, where he was well guarded, till the Great Duke had
sent express order for the bringing of his person to Muscovy. The Letters which the Czaar
Writ upon that occasion are such as may be well inserted in this place, that we may thereby
discover somewhat of the elegance of the Muscovian manner of writing.
                  In the name of Almighty God,The Great Duke's Letters to the Duke of Holstein who does all in all, and protects all Nations in good consolations,
from Him, who, by the Grace, Providence, Power, Vertue, Operation, and good pleasure of
God, to be magnifi'd in the blessed Trinity, and glorious in all Eternity, hath been chosen, and holds
the Scepter of the true Christian Faith, to govern and preserve, with Gods assistance, in peace and
quiet, without troubles, the Great Empire of the Russians, with all the Provinces thereunto annexed,
by Conquest or otherwise. We the Grand Seigneur, Czaar, and Great Duke, Alexei Michaelouits,
Conservator of all the Russes, &c. To the most mighty Frederick, Hereditary Prince of
Norway, Duke of Sleswick, Holstein, Stormarie and Ditmarse, Count of Oldenbourg, and Delmenhost,
Health. In the year 1644. or, according to the Calculation of Muscovy,
in the year 7152. the mentioned Timoska Ankudina, and Kostka Konichou, having
robbed our Treasure, to avoid the death they had deserved, departed the Countries under our
Iurisdiction, to go to Constantinople, where they professed the Turkish Religion. There they did so
great mischief in a short time, that they were forc'd to fly, and to retreat into Poland and Lithuania,
where they endeavoured to sow divisions between the neighbouring Princes. To that end they went
to Theodat Chmielniski, General of the Cosaques, whom the King John Casimir of Poland, our
Brother, commanded to put those Robbers into the hands of M. Germolitzowi, Gentleman of his
Chamber, who had order to send them to Muscovy, under the conduct of M. Peter Protesiowi, a
Gentleman of our retinue, as the said Chmielniski had made known to our Czaarick Majesty. But
these Robbers and Traitors got to Rome, where they embraced the Latin Religion. Afterwards
they passed through several other Provinces of Europe, where they changed their names, so as Timoska,
sometimes, assumed that of Zuski, and sometimes that of Sinensis, while Kostka went under
the name of his Servant, till such time as both having been known at Stockholm, by some of our
Merchants of Novogorod, and other places, and thereupon secured, one at Ruel, the other at

Narva, the Governours of those two places made some difficulty to deliver them up to us, without
express order from the Great Queen of Sueden. But when we had desired the said Great Queen of
Sueden, to put those Traitors into the hands of the Gentleman whom we had sent expressly for that
purpose, it happened that at his coming to Reuel, with the Orders of the said Great Queen, the
Governour had already suffered one of them to make his escape, so that he could bring along with
him but only the said Kostka. We have understood since, that the other hath been taken and imprisoned
in the Country of Holstein, wherefore we have thought fit to send to your Highness our Posanick,
Basili Spilki, accompany'd by some of our Subjects, with Letters from our Czaarick Majesty,
to intreat you, that you will be pleas'd to deliver up unto them, and to send to us those
Traitors.
                  The Letters were dated the last of October, 1652. after which the Great Duke sent another of the 5 of Ianuary, 1653. to the same effect, save that, at the end of the Letter, were added
the lines following. Since that time, there came to us, in the moneth of December last, Peter
Micklaf, of Novogorod, who hath informed us, how that, in pursuance of your Orders, the
said Traitor had been secured in your Ducal City of Neustat, and that upon the Remonstrance made
to you by the said Micklaf, you had translated him to Gottorp, to be there kept under a good and
sure guard. Wherefore we send back again unto you the said Micklaf, with Letters from our Czaarick
Majesty, to entreat you, to deliver up the said Traitor to him and Basili Spilki, that he
may have no further opportunity to escape, and raise new troubles in the World. In acknowledgement
whereof our Czaarick Majesty shall serve your Highness, in such occasions as shall present
themselves. This Robber and Traitor to our Czaarick Majesty, named Timoska, is of very mean
Birth, the son of a Linnen-Draper that dealt only in coarse cloaths, named Demki Ankudina,
of the Suburbs of Vologda, His Mother is called Salmaniska, and his Son, who is yet living,
Tereska. Timoska was an under Officer in the Nova Zetvert, and he hath robb'd our Treasury,
hath kill'd his Wife, and, with his own house, hath burnt several other houses that were near his,
whereby many of our Subjects have been ruined. Wherefore knowing that he could not avoid death otherwise
than by flight, he got away in the manner we have mentioned. Given at our Czaarick
residence of Moscou, the third of January, in the year of the Worlds Creation, 7161. and of the
birth of our Saviour, 1653. After this, he also writ a third Letter, of the 17 of October the same
year, upon which the Prisoner was delivered up to those, whom the Great Duke had appointed to
receive him.
                  One of these Deputies was the same Spilki whom Timoska had cheated of his Wife's coller
and Pearls. To be Gossips is a great allyance in Muscovy, besides they had been fellow-Officers
in the same Employment, wherefore Spilki desired, his Highness would give him leave to
see the Prisoner, and to speak to him in the presence of some Officers of the Court. But Timoska
behaved himself as if he knew him not, and would not speak the Muscovian, but the Polish
language, purposely to gravel the other, who could not speak it well. Spilki asked him, whether
his name were not Timoska Ankudina, and whether he had not robb'd the Great Duke's
Treasury, and committed several other enormous crimes? Timoska made him answer, that it
might be Timoska Aukudina had robb'd the Great Duke's Treasury, or converted his money to
his own use, but that he was not concern'd in it. That his name was Iohannes Sinensis, and in
the Polish language Zuiski, cunningly avoiding to hint at what he had said before, to wit, that
he was Son to the Great Duke, Iohn Basilouits Zuski. But when Spilki ask'd him, whether
he remembred not his life past; the other derided him, gave him injurious language, and added,
that he could not acknowledge him in the quality of a Poslanick, since he was but a poor
Shop-keeper, and seller of Pins, alluding to his name, Spilki, which signifies, a Pin-maker.
Timoska would needs, one day, intreat his Highness of Holstein to appoint his Chancellor, and
some others of his Councel, to receive from his own mouth the state of his affairs. They askt
him what house and family he was of, and whether he were of kin to the Great Duke, why
the Great Duke persecuted him, and wherein he could any way prejudice him? He answer'd,
that it was known; his name was Iohannes Sinensis, and in the Polish language, Zuski; that,
at his Baptism, he had been named Timotheus; that he was the Son of Basili Domitian Suiski;
and that he had been so surnamed, from a City in Muscovy called Suia: That he was originally
a Muscovite, but born and brought up in Poland, in the Province of Novogarka Severskhio,
and that he was hereditary Lord of Hukragina Severska, upon the Frontiers of Muscovy: That
the Great Duke was not his Kinsman, in as much as the Great Duke's Father had been but a
Gentleman, whereas his was a Prince born, and that was the reason why the Great Duke persecuted
him. That the Cham of Tartary, who was then ingaged in a War against the King
of Poland, would have employ'd him in a War against the Great Duke, but he had a greater
affection for the Country of his Predecessors, than to trouble its quiet: That it was in his power
to send above a 100000 men into Muscovy, but that God, of his goodness, had diverted
his thoughts from doing any such thing. He had written somewhat to that purpose to the
Patriarch. For the Poslanick, who came from Sueden, having enter'd into a Familiarity with
him, and advised him to write to the Patriarch, as the most likely person to procure his pardon,

he resolv'd to do it, and deliver'd his Letter to the Poslanick, in which he writ to the Patriarch,
that he was indeed a Muscovite, and, at his Baptism, had been named Timothy,
whereof the word Timoska is the diminutive. That he had had a desire to enter Muscovy with
an Army of 300000 men, but that he had been diverted from that pernicious design by the
Guardian Angel of Muscovy. That thereupon he came to himself, and was resolved to return
into his Country, whereas, had he been minded to continue his wicked life, it had been easie
for him to get out of the prison at Neustat, but that it was his intention to return into Muscovy
voluntarily, with those whom the Great Duke had appointed to conduct him. The Poslanick,
who doubted not, but that, upon this Letter, he would have made such a confession,
as night have convinc'd him, open'd, and read it in his presence. But he had to do with a man,
whom so small a matter would not make to betray himself. He would perswade them that the
Poslanick was a cheat, and that the Letter was counterfeited, that he had never writ it, and to
make good what he said, he writ another Letter of a Stile and Character so far different from
that of the former, that the Poslanick, mad to see himself so abused, flung it in his face. Timoska
took it up, and tore it to pieces.
                  But the distraction of his conscience was but too apparent in the inconsistency of his depositions,Timoska varies in his depositions.
and the declarations he had made, both by word of mouth and writing. For, one while,
he said, he was Son to the Great Duke, Basili Iuanouits Zuski; and another, he said his Fathers
name was Basile Domitian, though it was known, that, in that time, there were but
three Lords of the House of Zuski, and not any of them was of that name. Sometimes he
would be thought a Polander, and would confidently maintain that he could make it as clear as
the Sun at Noon, that he was no Muscovite, and that there was not any thing in his person,
language, or manner of life which might perswade the World that he was. Indeed his beard
was quite after another fashion than the Muscovitet ordinarily wear theirs. He had the Latin,
Italian, German and Turkish Languages, so well, as to be understood in any of them, and he
had such an art in counterfeiting all sorts of hands, that it was hard to convince him by that
which he writ in his first employment. Nay he would have had us suspect as counterfeited, the
Letters sent by the Great Duke to our Prince, because he had not signed them, and might have
surpriz'd us with that allegation, had we not learnt in Muscovy, that the Great Duke never
signs expeditions, but leaves that to be done by the Secretaries of State.
                  Timoska perceiving these evasions would not serve his turn,Would procure his own death. 
                     ell into despair, and would have
kill'd himself. For, being upon his way to Travemunde, to be ship'd away, not far from Neustat,
he cast himself down headlong from the Wagon, and shuffled himself under the Wheels,
hoping they would pass over his Body; but the ground being soft and sandy, his fall did him
no hurt, and the Wagon was immediately staid; so that they had the time to return him to his
place, where they fasten'd him beyond all fear of shewing such another trick. He seem'd to be
in a very good humour all the way, yet sought all the means he could imagine, to compass his
own death; but he was so narrowly watch'd, that at last being out of all hope to effect it, the
joy he had express'd before was much abated. Coming to Novogorod, he fell into so deep a
melancholy, that he was become absolutely disconsolate. Which yet hindred not but that amidst
the greatest tortures he express'd an admirable constancy, at least if I may so call the resolute
obstinacy, in which he persisted, as to his first depositions; whether it were his design
thereby to confirm, in strangers, the opinion he would have imprinted in them, or that he
considered with himself, that his confession would not prevent his death, nor alleviate his
misfortune.Is tortured As soon as he came to Moscou, he was put to the torture, in the presence of divers
persons of quality; but he impudently told them, that, of all the Bojares, he would not
vouchsafe to speak to any, but Knez Nikita Iuanouits Romanow; and him only, as knowing
him by fame, by reason of his goodness and courage he should be glad to have some discourse
withall. While two Bojares were gone to find out Nikita, Timoska desired somewhat to drink.
They presented to him some Quas, in a wooden dish, but he would have Hydromel, and that
it should be brought him in a silver Cup; but after they had so far comply'd with his humour,
he only put it to his lips, and would not drink. Seeing Nikita, and the other two Bojares
come in, he gave them a civil salute: but still affirmed, that he was Son to Basili Iuanouits
Zuski, though it were prov'd against him, that he was the Son of Dementi Aukudina, a Linnen
Draper of Vologda, and that the Great Duke Basili had had no children, but only two Brothers,
Knez Demetri Iuanouits, and Iuan Iuanouits Zuski, who both died without issue male.
For of these three Brothers, who were sent Prisoners into Poland, at the election of Vladislaus,
in the year 1610. with the rest of the Great Dukes kinred, the two elder died there, and the
third was releas'd, and sent back into Muscovy, where he died some few years before the execution
of Timoska. 'Tis true, there was another Lord of the same Family, but he had left only
one Son, named Michael Basilouits Zuski Scapin,
who died without issue, when the Suedes
took the City of Novogorod, in the year 1616.
                  While he endured the torture, they brought his Mother to him, who exhorted him to acknowledge
his crime. He seem'd to be moved at her presence, but persisted in affirming he knew

her not, no more than he did Iuan Pescou, with whom he had left his Son, when he left Muscovy.
This man represented to him how much he was to blame, for behaving himself so in
the condition he was in, and told him, that he must at last pull off the vizard, he had made use
of for so many years, to cheat the World, and disturb his Country, conjuring him to own his
Son, and rely no longer on elusions and impostures, which would only aggravate his misery,
and bring a greater weight of God's vengeance upon him. He was so mov'd hereat, that he
would not speak one word afterwards, though there were divers persons brought before him,
who had known him while he was employ'd at the Tavern-Office. He was search'd and found
to be Circumcis'd. The next day they put him again to the torture, but he would not speak at
all: so that he was immediately carried to the great Market-place, where his sentence was pronounced,And Executed???
and presently put in execution. They cut off, with an Ax, first, his right arm, below
the elbow, then the left leg, below the knee, and afterwards the left arm and right leg, and last
of all the head, The members were set up on stakes, and the trunk left upon the ground: but
the Dogs devour'd it in the night, and the next morning the Executioner's Servants dragg'd the
members to the place where all the City dirt is thrown.
                  His man, Kostka was pardoned, because he had confess'd the truth; but, in regard he had
been unfaithful towards his Prince, he was sentenc'd to lose three fingers of his right hand. The
Patriarch got that punishment to be moderated, upon this accompt, that the Religion of the
Muscovites obliging them to make the sign of the Cross with the right hand, which ought not
to be maimed, he receiv'd his punishment in the left, and was sent into Siberia, where provision
was made for his subsistence during life. About this time there came a Polish Envoy to Moscou
They gave him audience the same day that Timoska was put to death, and brought him through
the Market-place just at the execution, that he might be an eye witness of it, and give an accompt,
in Poland, of the Tragedy of that Impostor, who had been there look'd upon as son to
the Great Duke, Basili Iuanouits Zuski.
                  We said before, that the Great Duke Michael Federouits died Iul. 12. 1645. The very next
day, the Knez and Bojares would needs crown his Son, Alexei Michaelouits, who was not full
sixteen years of age. He it is that now reigns, and makes himself known by the War he made
upon Poland, as also by that which he daily threatens against Sueden. He was born, March 17.
1630. Knez Boris Iuanouits Morosou, fearing his enemies might take any advantage of the
Prince's tender years, so hastened his Coronation, that they could not send for all those who
are oblig'd to be present thereat, nor perform it with the requisite Ceremonies: which are as
followeth.
                  They summon to Moscou,The Ceremonies of the Czaar's Coronation, not only all the Metropolitans, Archbishops, Bishops, Knez, and
Bojares, but also the Principal Merchants, of all the Cities in the Kingdom. The day appointed
for the Coronation, the Patriarch, attended by the Metropolitans, conduct the new Great Duke
to the Church within the Castle, where a Scaffold is erected three steps high, cover'd with rich
Persian Tapistry, on which are set three Brocado Chairs, at an equal distance one from the
other. One is for the Great Duke, another for the Patriarch, and upon the third are set the
Ducal Cap and Robe. The Cap is embroider'd with Pearls and Diamonds, having upon the
Crown a Tassel, on which hangs a little Crown, set as thick as may be with Diamonds: and
the Robe is of a rich Brocado, lined with the best kind of Sables. They say the Great Duke
Demetri Monomach found it, at the taking of Kaffa, in Tartarie, and that he immediately design'd
it for the Coronation of the Princes his Successors.
                  As soon as the Czaar is come within the Church, the Clergy begin to sing their Hymn,
which ended, the Patriarch prays to God, to St. Nicholas, and the other Saints, desiring their
presence at that day's Solemnity. The prayer ended, the Chief Counsellour of State, taking
the Great Duke by the hand, presents him to the Patriarch, and sayes to him; Since the Knez
and Bojares acknowledge the Prince here present to be the next of Kin to the late Great Duke,
and lawfull Heir to the Crown, they desire, that, as such, you immediately Crown him.
Whereupon the Patriarch leads the Prince up to the Scaffold, and having seated him in one of
the three Chairs, he puts to his forehead, a little Cross of Diamonds, and blesses him. Then
one of the Metropolitans reads the following Prayer. O Lord our God, King of Kings,
who didst choose thy servant David, by the Prophet Samuel, and who didst cause him to be
anointed King over thy people Israel, hearken to our prayers, which, though unworthy, we
offer up unto thee. Look down, from the highest Heavens, upon this thy faithful servant,
who is here seated upon this Chair, and whom thou hast exalted to be King over thy people,
whom thou hast redeemed by the blood of thy Son. Anoint him with the Oyl of gladness;
protect him by thy power; set upon his head a precious Diadem; grant him a long and happy
life; put into his hand a Royal Scepter, and make him sit upon the Throne of Justice.
Make subject to him all barbarous Languages; Let his heart and his understanding alwayes
continue in thy fear. In all the course of his life, let him be constantly obedient to thy Commandement.
Suffer not any Heresie, or Schism to come near his Person or Government. Teach
him to maintain and observe whatsoever the holy Greek Church commandeth and ordaineth.

Iudge thy people in Iustice, and be merciful to the poor; that, when they leave this Valley of tears,
they may be received into eternal joys. Which Prayer the Patriarch concludes with these words, For
thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory; God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
Ghost be with us, and remain with us.
                  
                  The Prayer ended, the Patriarch commands two Metropolitans to take the Cap and Robe,
and having caused some of the Bojares to come upon the Scaffold, he commands them to put
them on the Great Duke, whom he blesseth a second time, by touching his forehead with the
little Cross of Diamonds. Then he causes to be given to them the Ducal Cap, to be set upon his
head, while he says, In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and then
blesses him the third time. That done, the Patriarch causes all the Prelates to approach, who
give the Benediction to the Great Duke, but it is only with their hands. That Ceremony ended,
the Great Duke and the Patriarch sit down, but they immediately rise again, to give order
for the singing of the Letany, whereof every verse ends with Gospodi pomiluy, Lord, have
mercy upon us, putting in ever and anon the great Duke's name. After the Letany they sit
down again, and one of the Metropolitans comes up to the Altar, and says singing, God preserve
our Czaar and Great Duke of all the Russes, whom God hath out of his love bestow'd on us, in
good health, and grant him a long and a happy life. All that are present, as well Ecclesiasticks as
Laicks repeat the same words, which make the Church echo again with the greatness of their joy.
Then the Bojares come up to the Great Duke, smite their foreheads in his presence, and kisse
his hand. That done, the Patriarch comes up alone before the Great Duke, and tells him;
That, since, through the Providence of God, all the Estates of the Kingdom, as well Ecclesiastical
as Temporal, have establish'd and Crowned him Great Duke over all the Russes, and have entrusted
him with a Government and Conduct of so great importance, he ought to apply all his thoughts to
love God, keep his Commandments, administer Iustice, and protect, and maintain the true Greek
Religion. That done, the Patriarch gives him the Benediction, and the whole Assembly goes
out of that Church, into that of St. Michael the Arch-Angel, which is opposite to the other,
where they sing over the same Letanies; which is done afterwards in that also of St. Nicholas,
where they conclude the Ceremonies, and Dine in the Great Hall of the Duke's Palace.
                  After the Coronation,The Great Dukes favourite. Alexei Michaelouits Morosou chang'd the quality of Governour
into that of Favourite and Chief Minister, and had the same power in Affairs, as he had over
the Prince's person during his fathers life. He began his establishment with the great Employments
which he bestow'd on the Kinred of the Great Dutchess-Mother, for whom the Prince
had a great Veneration: but under that pretence he kept them at a distance from Court, which,
as also the chiefest places of publick trust, he in the mean time fill'd with his own Kinred and
Creatures, who wholly depended on his fortune. He permitted not any other to come near the
Prince's person, whom he would often get out of the Capital City, under pretence of Hunting,
or some other divertisement; so to beget in him an aversion to business, that he might
have the management of all things. He thought the only way to make sure of him, would
be to get him a Wife, and to that end, he brought him acquainted with a Gentlemans Daughter,
who was an extraordinary Beauty, but of mean extraction. 'Twas his design to marry her
Sister, by that means to interesse the Great Duke more nearly in his preservation. These Gentlewomens
Father, was one Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski, very much look'd upon by the Favourite, not
only upon the accompt of his two fair Daughters, but also in regard of his constant attendance
on him. So that upon the confidence he had of his affection and fidelity, he one day took occasion
to speak to the Great Duke of him, and thence, to celebrate so highly the beauty of those
Gentlewomen, that, it rais'd in him a desire to see them. The Great Duke sent for them, under
pretence of a Visit to the Princesses his Sisters, and having seen them, he was so taken with
the Beauty of the Elder, that he immediately sent one to tell Miloslauskie, that he would honour
him with Alliance, and marry one of his Daughters. The Gentleman receiv'd the message
with much respect, and return'd his humble thanks to the Great Duke for the favour he was
pleas'd to do him. Soon after, they carried rich Presents to the intended Bride, and a good
sum of money to the Father, who, with others of the Kinred, could not, without that supply,
have appear'd at the Marriage of his Daughter. They were married on Shrove-Sunday,
in the year 1647. but without any noise, lest the consequences of that Solemnity might be frustrated
by Charms. Eight days after, Morosou was married to Miloslauskie's second Daughter,
and so became Brother-in-Law to the Great Duke.
                  Ilia Danilouits Miloslauskie was no sooner advanc'd to this new-greatness, but he would have
all the World to take notice of it. He pull'd down a Wooden house that had been given him in
the Castle near the Great Duke's Palace, and built a Sumptuous one of Stone in it's place. He
cast off, by degrees, the old Officers of the house, and brought in his own Kindred and Creatures;
who being no less necessitous than the chief of their family, let slip no opportunity of
advantaging themselves. Among others, he made one Leponti Steppanouits Plesseou Chief Judge
of the Citie of Moscou, in that Jurisdiction which they call Semskoi Duor. No Concussion, no
Extortion, but this man would undertake. He thought it not enough to receive Presents, but

would reduce both parties to the utmost extremities. He suborn'd false Witnesses, whose employment
was to bring in charges against those, who were rich enough to redeem themselves out
of his persecutions, imprisoning, and oppressing them till they purchas'd their Liberties with
the ruine of their Estates; and of these instruments of his Tyranny, one was called Peter Tichonuits
Trochaniotou, his Brother-in-law. This Peter was one of those, whom, in Muscovy,
they call Ocolnits, out of which number are chosen the Bojares, and he had the management of
the Puskarse Pricas, that is to say, was Overseer of the Armourers, Canoniers, and all the
Mechanicks belonging to the Arsenal, who were very much oppress'd by him. For, instead of
paying them monethly, as they are wont to do in Muscovy, where all that are in the Great
Duke's service, are so punctually pay'd, that if they come not the first day of the moneth for
their money, it is sent home to them; he, on the contrary, kept them several moneths without
it, forc'd them to compound, and to give acquittances for the whole sum, though they received
but some part. Besides, Trading was obstructed, Monopolies granted, and no Employment
could be had, but by dearly purchasing the Favorite Morosou's good pleasure. One got
a Patent, prohibiting the further use of the ordinary Ells, purposely to oblige the people to buy
Iron ones with the Great Duke's mark upon them: but instead of selling them at 8. or 10 d. a
piece, as they were worth, they could not be had under a Crown; by which means was rais'd
a vast sum of money, by reason of the necessity there was of having them all over the Kingdom.
Another found out the invention of raising the Poude (that is 40. pound) of Salt, to thirty
pence, which before cost but twenty. But instead of making advantage of it, they found at the
year's end, that the dearness of the Salt had so hindred the sale of it, that the Great Dukes revenue
was not only very much diminish'd, but abundance of fish was lost for want of sufficient
salting; so that had it not been their design rather to oppress the people than to promote the
Great Duke's service, they would soon have put down that new imposition. The Inhabitants
of Moscou, who had liv'd very quietly under the late Great Duke's reign could not but discover
their resentment of these pressures. They had their assemblies about the Churches, at the hours
when their Devotions brought them thither, and resolv'd at last to Petition the Great Duke.
And in regard no one person either would or durst undertake the delivery of a Petition to him,
they appointed a day to give it him themselves, as he should come out of the Castle, to go to his
devotions or divertisements. Their main spleen was against Leponti Steppanouits Plesscou, to desire
that his place might be supply'd by some person of honour, of whom they might expect
more Justice. They had their Petition ready, and sought two or three times an opportunity to
present it to the Prince; but the Bojares, who attend him in those Ceremonies, took it from
them, and making only a report of it, as they had been instructed by Morosou, the Petition was
not answered, nor the people reliev'd. This happen'd so often, that the people at last resolv'd
to take some other course, and to make their complaints by word of mouth, upon the first opportunity
that should offer it self. The 6. of Iuly 1648. they took their advantage of a Procession,
which the Great Duke made to a Monastery in the Citie called Stertenskie. The people
were got together in the Market-place before the Castle, to see him pass by, as they were wont;
but at his return, they broke through those that attended the Great Duke, came up to him, laid
hold of his bridle, stay'd him, and entreated him to hear the complaints they had to make to
him, concerning the injustices and violences committed by Plesseou, desiring there might be put
into his place some person of integrity, who should better supply so important a charge. The
Great Duke though a little startled at their procedure, still kept his countenance, and seem'd not
a little troubled at the grievances of his good Subjects, promised, that he would examine how
the matter stood, and that they should receive satisfaction. The people desir'd no more, and
were going away well satisfy'd with that answer, when some Bojares, friends of Plesscou, would
needs give the people abusive language, thrust some of their horses, and struck others with their
whips, whereat being incens'd, they so pelted their Lordships with stones, that they were forc'd
to make all speed they could to the Castle, whither the people pursued them so vigorously, that
all the Guard could do was only to stop them till the others were gotten into the Great Duke's
Chamber. This resistance of the Strelits, rather inflamed, than abated, the people's fury, who
threatned to force the Prince's Lodgings, and take away all they found there, if Plesseou were
not immediately put into their hands. Morosou came out into a Balcony, and endeavoured to
appease the people, exhorting them, in the name of his Czaarick Majesty, to go all to their
homes, and make no further tumult. But they told him, that they had as much to say to him
as to the other. Accordingly, some went immediately to his Palace, which was forc'd, ransack'd,
and demolish'd in a moment, having cast out at a window one of his Servants, who
would have made some opposition. Their animosity was such, as that they spar'd not even the
Images of their Saints, for which they are wont to have a great veneration. Yet did they shew
some respect to Morosou's Wife, and thought it enough to take away her Pearls and Jewels???
which they cast into the street, and to frighten her a little, by telling her, that had they not
look'd upon her as Sister-in-law to the Great Duke, they would have cut her to pieces. Among
other things, they broke his rich Coach, which, besides the expence in other things about it,

had all silver even about the Wheels. Some got into the Cellar, and knock'd out the heads of
the Strong-water Barrels, which taking fire consumed all those who had made themselves drunk.
This was the Prologue to the ransacking of several other houses afterwards,An Insurrection in Moscou. as those of Plesseou;
and Tichonouits, the Chancellors, and all that had any relation to, or dependance on the Favourite,
which afforded them such a booty, as that they sold Pearls by handfuls, and so cheap,
that for thirty Crowns a man might have bought a hat-ful; a black-foxe-skin, or a pair of Sables
for 2 s. 6 d. and stuffs of Gold, Silver, and Silk, in a manner for nothing.
                  Nazari Iuanouits Tzistou, Chancellor of Muscovy, had farm'd the imposition upon the
Salt, and lay sick in his bed, by reason of an accident that had happened to him three days before,
which was, that, meeting with a mad Ox, his Horsed started and threw him, so violently,
that he was in some danger of his life. But hearing that Morosou's house had been ransack'd,
and not doubting but they would come to his, he hid himself under a heap of Birch,
which they at a certain time make provision of, to serve the Stoves; and to take off all suspicion,
he caus'd himself to be cover'd with some Flitches of Becon: so that he had certainly saved his
life, had he not been betray'd by one of his Servants, who making his advantage of his Masters
misfortune, took a good sum of Money, and went to Nisenovogorod. The enrag'd multitude
took him out by the heels, and dragg'd him down stairs into the Court, where they cudgell'd
him to death. The body was thrown upon the Dung-hill, and the house so pillag'd, that
there was not any thing left. While these disorders were committed in the City, they had the
time to barricado themselves in the Castle, against the insolences of the people, who continued
all night between the 6 and 7 of Iuly, in arms, in such a posture, as shew'd they only expected
day-light to begin again. Whereupon, Orders were sent to the German Officers and Souldiers,
to meet at several rendevouzes, in the City, and to come in to the Great Dukes relief
at the Castle. They march'd with Drums beating, and Colours flying, and the Muscovites
instead of opposing them, gave them way, and told them, that they had no quarrel against
them, and knew them to be persons of honour who approved not the miscarriages of the Government.
Being got into the Castle, they took up the posts of their Guards, and the Great
Duke sent out Knez Nikita Iuanouits Romanow, whom he knew the people much respected, to
endeavour the breaking up of the Assembly. He came to the people, cap in hand, and told
them, that he conceiv'd they ought to be satisfy'd with the assurance, which the Great Duke
had made them the day before, that he would remedy the disorders of which they complained.
That his Majesty had commanded him to tell them as much, and to advise them to go every
man to his home, that he might the better perform what he had promised them. This message
was well receiv'd, and the people made answer, that they were not dissatisfied with the Great
Duke, but those who, under his name, abused his authority, and that they would not stir,
till they had deliver'd up to them, Boris Iuanouits Morosou, Leponti Steppanouits Plesseou, and
Peter Tichonouits Trachanistou, that they might revenge, on their heads, the mischief they had
done the whole Kingdom. Romanow gave them thanks for the kind answer they had made to his
proposition, and told them he would acquaint the Great Duke with the zeal and affection which
they express'd towards him; that he doubted not, but Order would be taken for the execution
of those three Lords, but that he could safely take his oath, that Morosou, and Trachanistow
had made their escape, and, for the third he should be immediately put to death. Accordingly,
Romanow was no sooner return'd to the Great Duke, but word was sent to the people,
that Plesseou was coming to be sacrific'd, and that the other two should come to the same end,
as soon as they were found, and that they should send for the Executioner to do his Office. He
was soon found, being at the Castle-gate with his servants, whence he came about a quarter of
an hour after, leading Plesseon to the Market-place, to cut off his head. But the people spar'd
him the trouble,Plesseou put to death. falling upon him with Cudgels, so outrageously, that they dispatch'd him in
a moment. They dragg'd the Body through the dirt, accompanying it with all the curses imaginable;
till at last a Monk, whom the deceas'd had order'd to be cudgell'd, cut off his head.
Morosou had indeed made his escape; but meeting with Waggoners and some of the people
searching after him, he was so fortunate as to avoid them, and by secret ways to get into the
Castle. And that it might not be thought, the Great Duke had consented to the escape of the others,
there were some sent after Trachanistou, who was taken near the Monastery  Troitza,
twelve leagues from Moscou. He was brought, the 8. to Semskoy Duor, that is, the place
where his Master had sate as Judge, which the Great Duke hearing of, he commanded his head
to be cut off. This execution wrought so much upon the people, that being informed how
Morosou had been met in the Country, and none knew what was become of him, they forbore
further pressing the Great Duke to give them what he had not, and, about 11. in the morning,
went every man to his home. In the afternoon several houses in the quarters of Metrossky
and Twersky, were set afire; whither the people, which had not yet clear'd the street, ran,
not so much to quench the fire, as to steal. It made such havock in a short time, that it consum'd
the whole quarter of Zuargorod, reducing to ashes all the houses within the White-Wall,
to the River Neglina, and getting over the River, into the Great Duke's Taverns, it got into

those of his Strong-waters, and grew so violent, that it was fear'd it would have buried the
Castle in its ashes. No body would endeavour to prevent it, those, who were oblig'd thereto,
being got so drunk, that, lying along in the streets, the vapours of the fire, they had in their
bodies, together with the smoak of that which was then in its way to burn down the whole City,
choak'd them as they lay. About 11. at night, some strangers looking, with no small astonishment,
on the fire in that house where they kept the Strong-water, for the Great Duke's
Provision, perceiv'd at some distance a Monk coming towards them with a great burthen, which
by his blowing they conceiv'd must needs be very heavy. Being come near, he call'd for some,
desiring them they would help him to cast into the fire, the body of the abominable Plesseou,
which he dragg'd after him, it being, as he said, the only way to quench it: But the Germans
refusing to meddle with it, he fell a-swearing and cursing, till some Muscovites did him
the good office, and holp him to cast the Carcass into the fire, which immediately began to
abate, and some time after went out ere they left the place.
                  Some dayes after this accident, the Great Duke treated the Strelits with Strong-water, and
Hydromel, and his Father-in-law, Ilia Danilouits Miloslausky, invited divers Citizens of several
Professions to dine with him, and spent several dayes together in entertainments. The Patriarch
also enjoyn'd the Priests and Monks to endeavour the settlement of unquiet spirits, and to
press unto them the respect and obedience to which their consciences oblige them. All thus
quieted, and the Great Duke, having supply'd the places of the executed, with able and approved
persons, he took the opportunity of a Procession, to speak to the people, in the presence
of Nikita Ieuanouits Romanou, and told them, that he was extremely troubled, to hear of the
injuries and violences done by Plesseou and Trachanistou, under his name, but contrary to his intention;
That he had put, into their places, persons of integrity, and such as being acceptable
to the people, would administer Justice equally, and without corruption; and that they might
not fail therein, he would have an eye over them; That he repeal'd the Edict about the imposition
laid on Salt, and that he would, with the soonest, suppress all Monopolies; That they
should enjoy all their Privileges, which if occasion were, he would augment. Whereupon, the
people having smitten their forehead, and given his Majesty thanks, the Great Duke re-assumed
his discourse and said, That it was true indeed, he had promis'd to deliver up to them the person
of Boris Iuanouits Morosou, and acknowledg'd, that he could not absolutely justifie him,
but that he could not also resolve to condemn him; That he hoped, the people would not deny
the first Request he should make to them, which was, that they would pardon Morosou, only
for that time, as to what he might have displeas'd them in; That he would be answerable for
him, and durst assure them, that Morosou should so behave himself for the future, as that they
should have occasion to speak well of him; That if they would not have him to be any longer of
of his Councel, he would dismiss him; but that he desir'd them to look on that Lord, as one
who had been a Father to their Prince, and one that having married the Great Dutchess's Sister,
must needs be extremely dear to him, and consequently, that it would be very hard for him to
consent to his death. The tears which concluded this discourse of the Great Duke's, discover'd the
affection he had for that Favorite, and so mov'd the people, that they all cry'd out, God grant
His Highness a long and happy life. God's and the Great Duke's will be done. The Czaar conceived
an extraordinary joy hereat, thanked the people, and highly celebrated the zeal and
affection they express'd for his estate and person. Some few dayes after, Morosou appeared in
publick, among those who attended the Great Duke, upon occasion of a Pilgrimage, which he
made to the Monastery of Troitza. He went uncover'd, from the Castle to the City gate, saluting
the people on both sides with great submissions; and from that time, he laid hold on all
occasions to gratifie, and assist those, who addressed themselves to him, in any business they
had at Court.
                  The story we have related confirms the truth of what we have said elsewhere, that the Muscovites,
how submissive and slavish soever they may be, will endeavour the recovery of their
freedom, when the Government becomes insupportable to them, and casts them into despair. I
shall here add another later example, which will be the less tedious, in that it hath some dependence
on the precedent, and relates very much to what we have seen, much about the same time,
in all the other Countries of Europe.
                  The Great Duke of Muscovy sent in the year 1649. a solemn Embassy to the Queen of
Sueden, the chief person whereof was, the Ocolnitza, Boris Iuanouits Puskin. He had order,
among other things, to accommodate the difference, which seemed to threaten those two States
with an inevitable War, proceeding hence, that the Subjects of both Crowns, left their own
habitations, and got into the other Kingdom to avoid the payment of their debts. And in regard
that for 32 years, that accompt had not been clear'd, and that there were more Suedes in
Muscovy, than there were Muscovites in Sueden, it was mentioned in the Treaty made by
Puskin at Stockholm, that for the first thirty years, there should be a liquidation of all accompts,
and for the two other, the Great Duke should pay to the Queen and Crown of Sueden 190000
Roubles, that is 390000 Crowns, part in mony, part in Rye, and that the payment should

be made in the Spring of the year 1650. Accordingly, Iohn de Rodes, being come at that time
to Moscou, in the quality of Commissary for the Queen of Sueden, receiv'd, in Copecs, and
Ducats 300000. Crowns, and order was sent to Foedor Amilianou, a Merchant of Plescou, to
provide as much Rye as should amount to 90000. Crowns. This interess'd man caus'd all the
Rye, wherever it were, to be seized, and permitted not private persons, to buy so much as a
bushel without his permission, which good leave of his they were forc'd to buy at a dear rate.
The Inhabitants of Plescou were so impatient under this oppression, that they not only quarrel'd
at the avarice of the Suedes, but charg'd Puskin with prevarication in his Employment, and perfidiousness
towards his Prince. They said that Morosou held correspondence with Strangers,
and presuming that this negotiation was concluded, contrary to the Great Duke's intention,
they endeavour'd to engage the City of Novogorod in their quarrel, and went so far on in their
work, that some of the chiefest Merchants having declared for them, the Weywode had much
ado to prevent an insurrection of the whole City. Both these and the others resolv'd that they
would stop the money, when it was to be transported into Sueden, and that they would no
longer endure the Treaty of the Rye, because it would in likelyhood starve the Country. With
this intention they sent three Deputies to Moscou, to wit, a Merchant, a Cosaque, and a
Strelits, with Order to know whether this Treaty was made, and put in execution with the
Great Duke's consent. In the mean time, without expecting the return of their Deputies, they
ransack'd Amilianou's house, and tortur'd his Wife, to make her confess, where her husband,
who had made his escape, had laid up his money. The Weywode came, in hope to prevent the
disorder, but he was forc'd out of the City, and the neighbouring Nobility invited to come in,
and joyn with them against Monopolies and Patentees. These three venerable Deputies were no
sooner come to Novogorod, but the Weywode caus'd them to be put into Irons, and in that posture,
sent them to Moscou, whether came at the same time the Weywode of Plescou, and the
Merchant Amilianou. Intelligence was brought, that those of Plescou had robb'd and abus'd a
Suedish Merchant, whereupon the Great Duke sent back the Weywode, and with him a Bojar,
to endeavour the further prevention of these disorders. Those of Plescou, who at first would
not receive them, at length opened their Gates, but it was, to put the Weywode in prison, and
to affront the Bojare, who had the imprudence, at so unseasonable a time, to treat them with
so much severity, that the people fell upon him with Cudgels, and pursu'd him to a Monastery,
where he was so beaten, that he was given over for a dead man.
                  However, the Great Duke pursu'd the execution of the Treaty made with Sueden, and paid
money instead of the Rye, sending along with the Suedish Commissary a good Convoy of Strelits,
who were to bring him to the Frontiers of Sueden. He gave order at the same time to Iuan
Nikitouits Gavensky, to assemble the Nobility of the neighbouring Provinces, and the foot-Regiments
of Colonel Kormichel, and Col. Hamilton, which made up above 4000 men, and
to besiege the City of Plescou. The Inhabitants, as first, pretended to stand out, but their courage
and strength soon fail'd them, so that they were forc'd to make an accommodation, at the
cost of the Authors of the Sedition, who were put to death, or sent into Siberia.
                  These disorders have occasion'd a great change in the Affairs and Government of Muscovy.
For, though Miloslauski and Morosou have much credit, and the Patriarch himself a very great
Authority about the Prince, yet have the other Knez and Bojares a great hand in publick Affairs,
and execute their charges every one according to his Birth and Employment. There are
commonly some 30 Bojares about the Court, though in Zuski's time there were numbred 70.
In the year 1654. when the War of Smolensko was resolv'd on, there were present at the deliberations
of that important affair, twenty nine Bojares, who names were these.
                  
                     Boris Iuanouits Morosou, the Czaar's Fanourite.

                  The persons of greatest quality next the Bojares, and the Ocolnits, are those whom they call
Dumeny Duorainy, and Simbojarski, that is to say sons of Bojars; and they are six in number;
to wit,
                  
                     Iuan Offonassouits Gabrienou.
                     Fedor Cusmits Iellissariou.

                     Sdan Basilouits Conderou.
                     Basili Federouits Ianou.
                     Ossonassei Ossipouits Prontzissou,
                  
                  The Chancellour and Secretaries of State, are,

                        Almas Iuanouits, Chancellour.
                        Simon Iuanouits Saborouski.
                        Lariouton Demetriouits Prontzissou.
                     
                  
                  These are the names of the Lords, who, at this day, have the principal charges, and govern
the whole Kingdom of Muscovy, as well in the Councel of State, as for private affairs; as we
shall see anon.
                  The chiefest Dignity of the Kingdom was,The principal Officers of Muscovy, and their . heretofore, that of Sunderstreuoi Coinische, that
is, Lord high Steward of Muscovy; but this charge was suppress'd when Zuski, who had it,
was called to the Crown. The next, which is now the chiefest, is that of Duoretskoy, or, Great
Master, who hath the over-sight and direction of all the great Duke's houshold. After him
comes the Orusnitschei, who hath the over-sight of the Arms and Horses, which are for the
Great Duke's peculiar service, as also of the Harnesses and other Ornaments, which are used at
Entrances, and publick Ceremonies. These three Officers precede all the other Bojares, Ocolnits,
Dumeni-Diaki, and the Secretaries of State, who, in their turns precede the Postilnizei,
or him who makes the Great Duke's bed, the Comnutnoy Klutziom, that is, the Chamberlain,

the Craftzey, or Carver, the Stolniki, or Gentlemen Sewers, the Strapsi, or Gentlemen of the
Privy Chamber, and the Duoraini, or ordinary Gentlemen. The Silzi, or Pages, the Diaki,
or Secretaries, and the Boddiotzei, or the Commissaries or Clerks, who are the last in Dignity
and Function.
                  All the Knez and Bojares,The Bojares obliged to follow the Court. who have Estates, are oblig'd to set out their Lands, and to give
their personal attendance at Moscou, where they are oblig'd to be every day at Court, and to
smite their foreheads in the Great Duke's presence, who looks on this attendance of theirs as an
argument of their fidelity, and an assurance of his Estate being in quiet, which might soon be disturb'd
by the authority, these Great men might assume in the Provinces, were they permitted
to make their aboad there.
                  Their Houses,Their expence. or Palaces, are great and magnificent, and they make great ostentation, as
well in their expences at their houses, as in cloaths and retinue when they go abroad. When
they ride, they have at the bow of their Saddle, a little Timbrel, a foot Diameter, which they
ever and anon touch with the handle of their Whip, to make their way through the throngs,
which are frequent in the Markets and Streets. The Knez, who have no employment at Court,
and have not the means to make any great appearance there, retire into the Countrey, where
their manner of life is not much different from that of Peasants.
                  They make very great accompt of the antient Nobility;They esteem Nobility. not only of that of their own Countrey,
but also of others; which they very particularly inquire into, but above all, are very curious
in informing themselves of the extraction of those that are sent Ambassadors in Muscovy,
They never match but with those of an equal rank with themselves.
                  The Bojares are not only seen at publick Ceremonies and Audiences, but effectively participate
of the management of publick affairs, and the decision of Law-sutes, wherein they assume
the quality of Presidents. The Councels for State-affairs are ordinarily held in the night time,
and the Counsellors meet at one in the morning, and are together till nine or ten.
                  We shall speak of the particular employment of the Bojares, when we have first given a short
accompt of the Great Dukes revenue, who, having an Estate of a very vast extent, consisting of
a great number of Provinces, must needs be very rich and very powerfull, as well in respect of
his Demesn, as the advantages accrewing from the Traffick made by his Factors, and the Taxes,
Duties, and Impositions paid by his Subjects. In times of peace, the Impositions are not great,
but in the time of War, the Contributions are so excessive, that when the Great Duke Michael
Federouits, was to besiege the Citie of Smolensko, in the year 1632. he oblig'd the subject to
pay him the Pettina, or fifth part of their Estates; but the present Great Duke, at the beginning
of the present War, contented himself with the tenth. The Knez, Bojares, and Gentlemen
pay no Taxes, but are oblig'd, as are also the Monasteries, to raise and maintain a certain
number of men, horse and foot, proportionably to their Revenue.
                  The Customs bring in so considerable a sum, that, some years, the Custom-house of the Citie
of Archangel it self payes in above 600000. Crowns. The Crucisnouduor, that is to say,
the Taverns, where the Great Duke allows the selling of Wine, Beer, Hydromel, and Aquaviae,
pay a vast sum, since he receives from three Taverns of the Citie of Novogorod above
12009. Crowns, and that, since this duty came to belong to the Sovereign, they are above a
thousand houses, where the Great Duke alone hath all the advantage made by the sale of Wine
and Aquavirae.
                  Sables also, and other Furs bring in much, because he reserves the Traffick thereof wholly to
himself, as also that of Cavayar, and several other Commodities. The Revenue of the money
which he lets out to his Factors is not so certain, as well in regard the Merchants profit is not
alwayes the same, as for that the Factors sometimes break. At our being there he had put 4000
Crowns in the hands of a Merchant named Savelli, who instead of improving it to his advantage,
squander'd it away in less than three years, that he lived in Persia. The Great Duke, ordered
the Poslanick, Alexei Sawinouits Romanitsikou, who went into Persia along with us, to take
him, and bring him back into Muscovy. Coming to Scamachy, we had notice of his being in
the City; but the Poslanick's Interpreter dying, he dissembled his having any order to take him,
and desir'd him to be his Interpreter, in that Negotiation, with a design, under that pretence,
to bring him to the Frontiers, and so to carry him away. The other, who stood upon his
Guard, serv'd him indeed during the Poslanick's aboad at Ispahan, but, when he saw him ready
for his departure into Muscovy, he got into the Allacapi or Sanctuary, was Circumcised, put
himself under the protection of Mahomet, and continued in Persia.
                  The Great Duke farms out all his Demesn,His Expenc. but the revenue arising thence, goes, for the
most part, towards the subsistence of the Strelits, whereof he is obliged constantly to maintain
a very great number, as well in the City of Moscou, where there are above 16000. of them, as
upon the Frontiers; insomuch that the ordinary Militia makes above 100000. men. In a word,
if his receipts are great, his expences are proportionable thereto. There hardly passes a year,
but he is forc'd to purchase a Peace with the Tartars, with great sums of Money and Presents.
He does not carry on his Wars at so easie a rate as they do elsewhere. For, taking into his

service, a great number of Germans and other Foreiners, as well Officers as Souldiers, he is
forc'd to pay them extraordinarily, and some times before hand. The Embassies he receives
stand him in no less than those he sends, for he defrays all publick persons, and makes them
very considerable Presents. The expence of his Table, and the rest of his Court must
needs be very great, there being above a thousand Persons who have meat provided for
them.
                  At Dinner and Supper, there is no sounding of Trumpets, as there is elsewhere, but one
of the Officers goes to the Kitchin and Sellar-doors, and cries Godusar Kuschinung, that is,
The Grand Seigneur would be served, and immediately the meat is carried up. The Great
Duke sits at the midst of the Table, alone; if he invites the Patriarch or any other great Lord
to Dine with him, there is another Table set at the end of his, and they are serv'd with some
of the meat which had been presented to the Great Duke, I say, presented, for as much as all
making up but one Course of about fifty Dishes of meat, the Gentlemen set them not down upon
the Table, but hold them in their hands, till the Carver hath shewed them to the Prince,
and he made choice of what he is desirous to eat. If none Dine with him, he sends the Dishes he
hath not medled with, to some Lords in the City, or to his Physicians. The present Great
Duke hath but one, who is the same that went along with us into Persia. He is no superstitious
Galenist, but, with very good success makes use of Chymical remedies: he is grown so famous,
that not only the Prince, but the Bojares and other great Lords about the Court employ
him. His salary is 124 Crowns, a Month, besides a Pension of six hundred Crowns, per an.
and he hath more Wheat, Barly, Honey, and several other Provisions than he can spend in his
Family. The Great Duke is never purg'd, nor bled, but the Physician hath a present of a hundred
Crowns, and a piece of Satin or Velvet, or a Zimmer of Sables, which is worth no less.
The Bojares do not give their Physicians money, but a certain number of Flitches or Gammons
of Bacon, Sables, Strong-water, and other Provisions. They are obliged to go every day to
Court, and to smite their foreheads in the Great Dukes presence, or at least, before those
who are entrusted with the care of his Cabinet of Druggs, and other Apothecary's
stuff.
                  There are many Interpreters for other Languages, especially for the German, the Polish, the
Suedish, the Turkish, and the Persian. He whom the Great Duke does chiefly make use of in
his most important affairs is a Dane, and is so generally vers'd in all the Europaean Languages,
that coming three years since to the Court of Vienna, with Iuan Iuanouits Boklakouskoi, and
Iuan Polycarpousin Michailou, the Emperor lik'd him so well, that, out of his own inclination,
he made him a Nobleman. The Great Duke's Court hath this common with those of other
Princes, that Vice takes place of Vertue, and gets nearer the Throne. Those who have the honour
to be nearest his person, are withall more subtile, more deceitful, and more insolent than
the others that have not. They know very well how to make their advantages of the Princes
favour, and look for the greaest respects and humblest submissions imaginable, from those
who make their addresses to them; which the others render them, as much to avoid the mischief
they might do them, as for the good they expect from them.
                  The Great Duke's Council is divided into six Classes, or, as they call them, Courts of
Chancery. The first is for strangers Affairs; the second for War; the third, for Crown-Lands
and the Prince's Revenue; The fourth receives the Accompts of Factors, and those who
manage the Taverns. The fifth takes Cognizance of Appeals in Civil Causes; and the sixth, of
those, of Criminal Causes.
                  We said before, that the Bojares are not only employ'd in State-affairs, but also in the decision
of private differences, at which they preside, alone, or with other Judges, according
to the nature of those affairs that present themselves.
                  They call Pololskie Pricas, the place, where they regulate the affairs of Ambassadors, as also
the Posts of the Kingdom, and what concerns such Merchants as are strangers. Almas Iuanouits
is Secretary of the Court.
                  In the second Court, or Chamber, which they call Roseradni Pricas, there is a Register
kept of the quality and families of the Bojares and all the Gentlemen of Muscovy, as also of
all exploits of War, and the advantages or losses which the Great Duke receives thereby. Iuan
Ossonassinouits hath the Presidency of it.
                  In the Pomiestnoi Pricas, which is the third Chamber, there is a Register kept of all the Mannors
held by homage, and the sutes concerning the same are judged. There are also received the
duties belonging to the Great Duke, from the said Mannors; under the direction of Foedor
Cusmits Iellisariou.
                  In the Casanskoy, and Siberskoy Pricas, that is to say, the fourth and fifth Chamber, the
differences of the Provinces of Casan and Sieria, are judged, and an accompt is kept of the
Skins and Furrs, which come from those Provinces to the Great Duke. Bojar Knez Alexei
Nikiteuits is President of those two Chambers.
                  
                     
In the Durovoi Pricas, are judged the differences between the Great Duke's Servants, and
what concerns his House; under Bojar Basilouits Butterlin.
                  The Inasemski Pricas, is for such Military Officers as are strangers, whose Causes are there
try'd; and who in times of Peace do there receive their Orders, from Ilia Danielouits Miloslauski,
the Great Duke's Father-in-law, who is the President thereof.
                  The Reitarskoi Pricas, judges the Causes of the Muscovian Cavalry, and there, in time of
Peace, they receive their Orders and pay; to wit, sixty Crowns, per an. for every Horseman,
under the presidency of the same Ilia Miloslauski. This Cavalry consists for the
most of Gentlemen, who have very little of Estate, yet hold Mannors by homage and
fealty.
                  In the Boschoi Pricod, all the Receivers of the Great Duke's duties give in their accompts once
a year. The Bojar, Knez Michael Petrouits Pronski, who is President of this Pricas, sets a
tax on forein Bread and Wine. He hath also the over-sight of Weights and Measures all over
the Kingdome. It is also his place, to pay those Strangers that are in the Great Duke's
service.
                  The Sudnoy Wolodimirskoy, and the Sudnoy Moskauskoy Pricas; have for President the Bojar,
Knez Gregory Simonouits Kurakin, who, in the former, judges the Knez and Bojares; in the other,
the Gentlemen and Officers of the Court.
                  The Bojar, Knez Boris Alexandrouits Reppenin presides in the Rosboinoy Pricas, and judges
Robberies upon the High-way, Murthers, and other criminal causes.
                  Peter Tychonouits Trachanistou, was President in the Puskarskoy Pricas, and had the oversight
of Founders, Furbishers, Canoniers, Armourers, Smiths and Carpenters, who wrought
to the Arsenal; but his place is bestow'd on the Bojar, Knez Iurgi Alexouits Dolgaruskoi,
not only to judge of differences between them, but also to receive their work, and pay them
their wages.
                  The Iamskoy Pricas is for the regulation of Stages and Post-masters, and the payment of their
Salaries; as also to give passes to those that desire them, and are to have their carriadge upon
the Great Duke's accompt, under the Presidency of the Ocolnitza, Iuan Andreowits Miloslauski.
                  The Diaks, Secretaries, Clerks, Captains of the Gates, and Messengers of the several Prica's
have their particular Judge, who is the Ocolnitza, Peter Petrouits Gollowin, in the Tziolobitnoi
Pricas.
                  The Semskoy Duor, or Selmskoy Pricas, is for the judgement of all other Civil Causes between
the Citizens of Moscou. There, are paid the duties arising from places and houses that
are sold, as also the rates levied for the reparations of Bridges, Gates, Fortresses, and other
publick buildings, under the direction of Ocolnitza, Bogdan Matheowitz Chitrou.
                  The Golops, that is to say, Slaves, have a particular Court, where they make their declaration
when they are sold, and where they take out a Certificate, when they redeem themselves,
or recover their liberty any other way. This is called the Choloppi Pricas; the President, Steppan
Iuanouits Isleniou.
                  The place, where an accompt is kept of all the Stuffs, as Brocado, Velvet, Satin, Damask,
&c. which are for the use of the Court, and whereof Garments are made for the Great
Duke to present to forein Ambassadors, and other persons of quality, is called the Bolchikasni
Pricas.
                  Under the Magazine is the Treasury, or Exchequer, where all the money that remains at
the years end, is put into the Kings Coffers, under the oversight of Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski,
who is also President of the Chamber, where are judged the Causes of the Great Duke's principal
Merchants and Factors, which is called Casamoi Pricas.
                  The Ocolnitza, Knez Iuan Federouits Chilkou, is the Judge of all Ecclesiastical persons, as
well Secular Priests as Monks, who are oblig'd to submit to the temporal Jurisdiction, unless
it be in privileg'd Cases; in the Monasterski Pricas.
                  The Great Duke hath a very vast structure design'd for the Stones, Lime, Wood, and other
Materials which are for his own use, which place is called the Carmenoi Pricas; and there it is
that the Duorainin, Iacob Iuanouits Sagraiskoi decides the differences between Carpenters,
Masons, and other Workmen, and pays them for their work.
                  The Revenue of Novogorod and Nisenovogorod is paid in at the Pricas, called Novorodkoi
Zetwert, where the particular receivers of those two Cities give in their accompts. Sometimes
the Causes of the Inhabitants of those two places are judged in this Pricas. For though ordinarily
there be no appealing from the Weywodes, yet those who mistrust the success of their business,
by the partiality they observe in the Weywode, may remove their Causes to Moscou. The
Chancellor Almas Iuanouits is the President of it.
                  The Provinces of Gallitz and Volodimer have also their particular Pricas, for the same
purpose; it is called Galliasko-Volodimirski Pricas; the President, the Ocolnitza, Peter Petrouits
Gollowin.
                  
                     
The monies arising from all the Taverns and Kabas of Muscovy is paid in at the place called
Nova Zetwert, where all those who keep publick drinking houses are oblig'd to take the Wine,
Hydromel, and Strong-water they sell by retail, and to give an account of the sale of it. There
they also punish those who sell any without Licence, as also those who sell or take Tobacco, if
they be Muscovites, the Germans and others, Strangers, being permitted the Traffick and use
of it. The Ocolnitza Bogdan Matheowits Chitrou presides in this Pricas.
                  The Bojar, and Master of the Ordinance, Gregori Basilouits Puskin, under whose jurisdiction
are Castrom, Iareslou, and other Cities of those quarters, receives their accompts, and decides
their differences, in the Castromskoi Pricas; as the Ocolnitza, Knez Demetri Basilouits
Lewou does those of Vstoga, and Colmogorod, in the Vstogskoi Pricas.
                  The same Gregori Basilouits Puskin keeps the Jewels of the Crown, and hath the over-sight
of the German Gold-smiths, who make Gold and Silver Plate, and sell precious Stones, and
hath his Office for those things in the Solotoya Almasnoy Pricas. He hath also a key to the Great
Duke's Magazine of Arms, and administers Justice to those who are employ'd about Arms
for his particular use, and pays them, in the Rusiannoy Pricas.
                  The Physicians, Apothecaries, Chirurgeons and Operators, and all of that function are oblig'd
to smite their fore-heads in the presence of Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski, who is their Overseer,
and whom they are to acquaint, if the Great Duke wants any thing that relates to their
Professions.
                  Tamosini Pricas is for the receit of all duties of entrance into the City of Moscou, which is
made by one of the Goses, accompany'd by two or three Assessors, who give in their accompt
thereof to a Chamber called Bolschoi Prichod; these Goses are changed every year.
                  The payment of the tenth penny, towards the War, is made to the Bojar, Knez Michael
Petrouits Pronski, and the Ocolnitza, Iuan Basilouits Alferiou, in the Sbora dezatti dengi Pricas.
                  The Affairs that have no peculiar Pricas have a general one, called Siskoi Pricas, under the
superintendency of Knez Iurgi Alexowits Dolgaruskoi.
                  The Patriarch hath his particular Pricas's; to wit; that of Roscrad, where a Register is kept
of all the Church-goods, and where are the Charters and Archives; that of Sudny, where the
Patriarch hath his Spiritual Jurisdiction; and that of Casaunoy, where the Patriarch's Revenue
and Treasure is kept. He hath also his Ecclesiastical Judges and Officers, who give him an account
of all their actions.
                  There is no Pricas, but hath its Diak, or Secretary, and many Clerks and Coppiers, who
all write very well, and are skill'd in Arithmetick, according to their way, in which they make
use of Plum-stones instead of Counters. Whence it comes, that there is no Officer but hath
about him a certain quantity of them in a little purse. They are forbidden, upon pain of whipping,
to take Poschnl, or Presents; yet they venture to do it; nay their avarice is such, that
many times, they will, of themselves, proffer Copies of dispatches, and private resolutions,
out of a hope to get somewhat for them. But these proffers are to be mistrusted, for I know by
experience, that those people seldom have what they put others in hope of; or if they have,
it is so dangerous to communicate it, that for the most part they put off forgeries and suppositious
pieces. In the year 1643. the Minister of a Forein Prince being desirous to have a Copy of
my Dispatches, one of the Clerks of the Counsel sold it him at a very dear rate. I was shewn it
afterwards; but when at my return to Holstein, the Letters were translated, there was nothing
of what I had seen in the Copy.
                  They do not keep a Register of their Acts in Books, but they write them in Rolls of paper
pasted together, till they are 25. or 30. ells in length; of which their Offices are full.
                  At our coming to Moscou, we were made believe, that Presents could procure any thing at
Court. Indeed I have known some Lords, who though they would not take ought themselves,
were not sorry to see any thing sent to their Wives: but I have also known some, who made it
appear, they were absolutely incorruptible, and that their fidelity to their Prince was Presentproof,
to their great regret, who consider, that where nothing is given, nothing is thence obtain'd.
                  Justice is administred in the Pricas's we have spoken of.Their administration of Iustice. The Bojar, who presides there, hath
his Secretary, and Assessors, and finally determines whatever comes before him. Heretofore the
Muscites had but few  and few Customs, according to which all Cases were decided.
They concern'd only attempt 
                     ainst the Great Duke's person; Treasons against the State, Adulteries,
Thefts, and Debts bween private persons. The decision of all other Affairs depended
on the breast of the Judge.  the year 1647. the Great Duke assembled together the
most Famous Men of the Kingdom, and caused to be set down in writing, and to be publish'd,
several Laws and Ordinances, whereby the Judges are to regulate themselves. They were
printed, in folio, under the Title of SOBORNA ULOSIENIA, that is to say, Vniversal
and General Right, for the direction of the Bojares.
                  Heretofore their proceedings were thus. In those Causes, where the parties were not agreed
as to the matter of fact, and had no evidence of either side, the Judge asked the Defendant, whether

he would take his Oath, that the matter was as he alleged, or refer it to the Plaintiff's Oath.
He who proffer'd to take his Oath, was, once a week, for three weeks one after another,
brought before the Judge, who every time, press'd unto him the importance of an Oath, and
the sin he would burthen his Conscience withall, if he swore falsly. If, notwithstanding these
remonstrances, he still persisted in his readiness to take his Oath, though he swore nothing but
the truth, yet people look'd on him as an infamous person, would spit in his face, and turn him
out of the Church, into which he was never receiv'd afterwards, much less was he admitted to
the Communion, unless it were at the point of death. Now, they do not proceed with so much
rigour, but only bring him who is to take his Oath before an Image of one of their Saints,
where he is asked, whether he will take his Oath upon the salvation of his Soul? If he persist,
they give him a little Crucifix to kiss, and afterwards the Saint's Image, which for that purpose,
is taken down from the Wall. If the Oath be good, the party who took it is not to be admitted
to the Communion for three years, and though he be not treated as an infamous person,
yet those of any quality will not easily suffer him in their Company: but a perjur'd person, is
severely punished; first cruelly whipt, then banish'd. Whence it comes, that the Muscovites
endeavour all they can to avoid it, though upon any trivial occasion, especially in their dealings,
they stick not to swear at every word, and have incessantly in their mouths their Po Chrestum,
by Christ, making the sign of the Cross at the same time: but there is little credit to be given
those kinds of Oaths, as proceeding from deceit and passion. They permit strangers to take
their Oaths, according to the rules of their several Religions.
                  No invention but they make use of to force people to confess the truth by Torture. One of
the most cruel, in my opinion, is the Strapado, which is often given in this manner. The Malefactor,
having his hands ty'd behind him, is wound up into the air, and so hangs, having
fasten'd to his feet, a great beam, upon which the Executioner ever and anon gets up, to augment
the pain, and further the dislocation of the Members, while the smoak and fire which are
made under his feet, burns and stifles him. Sometimes they cause the Malefactor's head to be
shaven, and, as he is so hanging, they pour cold water, drop by drop, upon the crown; which
is such a torment as no other comes near, not even that of whipping, (which they many times
give those in that condition) though they at the same time clap a red-hot Iron upon the stripes.
                  In ordinary quarrels, he who gives the first blow gets the worst. Murther, committed without
any necessity of defence, is punish'd with death. The guilty person is kept six weeks in a
very close Prison, and fed only with bread and water; after which he receives the Communion,
and hath his head cut off.
                  Thieves are Tortur'd, that they may discover their Complices, and confess their other Crimes.
If it be the first offence, they are whipt from the Castle-Gate to the great Market place, where
the offender hath an Ear cut off, and is put into prison for two years. If he offends the second
time, he is punish'd in the same manner, and is kept in prison, till he hath company, to be
banish'd into Siberia. Theft is never punish'd with death in Muscovy; but the concealers and
receivers fare no better, which is the best course could be taken to bridle the lewd inclinations of
that people.
                  The ordinary punishments,Their ordinary punishments. are slitting the nostrils, Whipping, and the Baltoki. The last is
not alwayes infamous and publick; yet is there not any Master of a Family, but gives it his
Children and Servants. He who is to receive this Chastisement, puts off his Kaftan, and, having
only his shirt on, layes himself down upon the ground, on his belly, and then two men
set themselves cross upon him, one upon his Neck, the other upon his Feet, having each of
them a little Wand or Switch in his hand, wherewith they beat him upon the Back, much after
the manner that Fell-mongers beat their Furs, to get out the Worms. They ordinarily have
their Nostrils slit who have taken Tobacco, in snuff, contrary to the Great Duke's prohibition.
                  Whipping as it is given in Muscovy, is one of the most barbarous punishments that ever
were heard of. Sept. 24. 1634. I saw eight men and one woman Whipt, for selling of Aquavitae
and Tobacco. The Executioner's man took them up one after another upon his back, being
stript down to the waste, and having their feet ty'd together with a Cord, which passing
between his Legs that held them up, was held by another servant of the Executioner's, so fast,
that they were not able to stir. The Executioner stood three paces off, with a Bull's Pizzel,
having fasten'd to the end of it, three straps or thongs of an Elk's skin, not tann'd, and consequently
as sharp as a Rasour, with which he lay'd on their backs with all his strength, so as
that the blood gush'd out at every lash. The men had each of them 25. or 26. till the Clerk,
who had in a Note what number of lashes they were to receive, cry'd Polno, that is to say,
enough. The Woman had but 16. yet did she fall into a swound. Being thus disciplin'd, so as
that their backs were in a manner slic'd and slash'd all over, yet were they all tyed by the Arms,
two and two together, those who had sold Tobacco having a little horn full of it, and those
who had sold Aquavitae, a little bottle about their Necks, and whipt through the Citie, and
after they had walk'd them above half a league about, they were brought back to the place of
their first execution, and dismiss'd. This is so cruel a punishment, that some die of it, as we

said before of the son of General Herman Schein. Some after they are thus punish'd wrap themselves
up in the skin of a sheep newly kill'd.
                  Heretofore these punishments were not infamous, and those who had pass'd through the Executioner's
hands, were admitted into the best Companies, as was also the Executioner himself,
whose Profession was accounted so honorable, that sometimes even Merchants quitted theirs, to
serve the Magistrate at Executions, and would buy the employment, and after certain years sell
it again to others. The advantages of it ly in this, that the Executioner is not only paid by the
Judge, but gets money also out of the Criminal, to be more gently treated, though indeed, the
greatest profit he makes comes from the Aquavitae, which he sells underhand to the Prisoners.
But now this employment is not much courted, since the Muscovites have begun to learn somewhat
of civility from their Neighbours. Nor is the Executioner permitted to sell his Office, but
it must continue in his family, which failing, the Butchers are oblig'd to recommend to the
place one of their body.
                  All we said of the cruelty of their punishments is yet below what they inflict on such as cannot
pay their debts. He who pays not at his time, mentioned in the Bond, is put into a Sergeants
house, having a certain further time to make satisfaction. If he fail, he is carried to
prison, whence he is every day brought out, to the place before the Chancery, where the common
Executioner beats him upon the shin-bone with a Wand about the bigness of a man's little
finger, for a whole hour together. That done, he is return'd to prison, unless he can put in security
to be forth-coming the next day at the same hour, to be treated in the same manner, till
he hath made satisfaction. And this is executed with much rigour upon all sors of persons, what
condition or quality soever they be of, Subjects, or Foreiners, Men, or Women, Priests, or
lay persons. 'Tis true, some present being made to the Executioner, he suffers the Debtor to
put a thin Iron-plate within his boot, to receive the blows; or it may be he smites more gently.
If the Debtor have not to satisfie, he must be sold, with his Wife and Children, to
the Creditor.
                  As to the Religion of the Muscovites,The Religion of the Muscovites. before we enter into the discourse of it, we shall say,
that there have been Lutherane Doctours in Sueden and Livonia, who have made it a problematical
question, whether the Muscovites were Christians or not? They might as well have made it
disputable in their Acts, whether the Muscovites are men; since there is not so great a difference
between their Religion and that of other Christians, as there is between their Morality
and manner of life, and that of many other men: but as laughter and speech makes them men,
so Baptism and their external profession of the Christian Religion, denominates them Christians.
If a man would take their word for it, they are the only true Christians in the World, since they
only have been baptized, whereas others have been only sprinkled; which is the reason, they
receive no Proselyte, till he be re-baptized. They ground their Religion on the Books of the
Old and New Testament, and they use Sacraments. Their Translation of the Bible is that, which
they call of the seventy Interpreters, which some few years since they have got Translated and
Printed in their own Language. They permit not that a man should bring the whole Bible to
Church, for fear of profaning it by several, not over-modest, passages they find in the Old
Testament: whence it comes they bring only the New, and some Verses taken out of the
Psalms and Prophets; but in their houses they are permitted to read the whole Bible. In the
explication of the Bible, they give much authority to St. Cyril Bp. of Ierusalem, whom they
call Quirila Ierusalimski, and who writ a Catechism, under the Emperour Theodosius. He
flourish'd about the end of the fourth age, and is not to be confounded with Cyril of Alexandria,
whose memory the Greeks celebrate on the 9. of Iune, whereas they celebrate the Festival
of the other upon the 18 of March, as may be seen in their Menologies. The other Fathers,
whose authority they follow, are Iuan Domaskin, (Iohn Damascene) Grigori Bogosloa, (St.
Gregori Nazianzen) Iuan Solotauska, (St. Iohn Chrysostome) and Ephrem Syrin, Ephram,
Deacon of the Church of Edessa, in Syria. They relate of him, as also does Gerard Vossius, who
hath Translated him into Latin, that an Angel having presented to him a Book writ in Golden
Characters, which no body could open, he immediately deriv'd those illuminations from it,
which are at this day apparent in the books he hath publish'd. Besides him, they have also another
particular Doctor, named Nicholas Sudatworits, who hath writ certain spiritual Treatises.
The Muscovites have so great a Veneration for this man's memory, that it is not long since,
that Wax-Candles were lighted before his Picture, for which they had built a particular
Chapel, in the great street which leads to Twere Gate: but both were destroy'd by the
late fire.
                  S. Athanasius Creed is their rule of Faith. They believe in God the Father, as Creator of
all the World, in God the Son, as Saviour and Redeemer of all Mankind; and in the Holy
Ghost, as Sanctifier of all the Faithful.
                  'Tis true, their Religion is full of abundance of chafy Superstitions; in that they consider
the Virgin Mary, the Evangelists, the Apostles, and an infinite number of other Saints, not
only as simple Intercessors, as the most intelligent affirm, but also as causes, and co-operators

of their Salvation. There is no Muscovite but gives his Saints and their Images, the honour
due only to God, who is so jealous thereof, that he treats that false Worship as spiritual
Whoredom. The ignorance of the meaner sort of people is so gross, that they place all Religion
in the honours and veneration they give their Images. It is also all the instructions they
give their Children, who in order to devotion, learn only to stand with great respect before
those Images to say their Prayers. Their good works, (which they believe meritorious) are,
building of Monasteries and Churches, and giving Alms; besides which they do nothing whereby
a man might judge of their Faith by their works.
                  They stand very much upon their being Members of the Greek Church, and their Histories
and Annals say, that Christian Religion was planted in Russia in the Apostles times. That St.
Andrew leaving Greece, embark'd upon the River Boristhenes, and came, by the Sea of Ladoga,
to Novogorod, where he preach'd the Gospel. That, since that time, Christian Religion
had been absolutely destroy'd, by the Tartars and other Pagans, who became Masters of all
Muscovy; and that about the year 989. Wolodimer, Great Duke of Russia, having gain'd
very great victories over his Neighbours, and re-united several Provinces to his Crown, became
so considerable, that Basilius, and Constantinus Porphyrogennetes, Emperours of Constantinople,
sent a solemn Embassy to congratulate and complement him. That brought him
first acquainted with the Christian Religion, which he afterwards embraced, and was baptized.
The Bishops and Priests sent thither by the Patriarch of Constantinople further instructed and
baptized the people, who have ever since made profession of the Greek Religion.
                  Iohannes Curopalates, who writ part of the Byzantine History, and liv'd about that time,
says, that this Conversion was not effected without miracle, and that the Bishops faith prevail'd
more upon the spirits of these Barbarians, than the preaching of the Gospel. For being
not able to comprehend the wonderful things which are said of our Saviours life, they desired
a proof of that promise he makes to the faithful, of giving them by the Father what ever they
should desire in his name. The Bishop undertook it, and told them, that he had so great an assurance
of the Word of God, that they could not desire any thing, which his prayer should
not obtain from God. Whereupon they said, that since God had preserv'd Daniel's companions
in the fiery Furnace, he might as well prevent the Bible, which is full of all those marvellous
things, from being consumed by fire. The Bishop was content to stand to this tryal, and
so cast the Bible into a great fire, where having lyen till the fire was all spent, the Book was
taken out as untouch'd as when it was cast in. Cedrenus and Zonaras confirm the truth of this
story, and say that Wolodimir was so moved at this miracle, that he immediately abolish'd all
Idolatry, and banish'd it his Territories.
                  Hence it comes that the Muscovites love the Greeks, and have a kindness for them, and do
them all the good they can, when any occasion offers it self. In the year 1649. The Patriarch
of Ierusalem came to Moscou, and brought the Great Duke some of the earth of our Saviour's
Sepulchre, though it is known 'twas cut out of a Rock, and some holy-water from
Iordan. He was most magnificently receiv'd, and conducted by the whole Clergy to his audience,
which the Great Duke gave him, together with a Present of above 100000 Ducats: but
he was so unfortunate in his return, as to fall into the hands of some Turks, who took away
all had been given him. There come almost every year to the Czaar's Court, some of
the Greek Priests or Monks, to sell their Reliques, which they put off at very good
rates.
                  The Muscovites do all profess the same Religion, which being as it were particular to them,
may be said to extend as far as the Great Duke's Dominions do; unless it be, that it is also exercised
at Narva, under the Jurisdiction of the King of Sueden, and that the Tartars have also
their Mahumetan and Pagan Religion, along the Wolga, and beyond Astrachan, upon the
Caspian Sea. There are not any, not even among their Monks and Priests, that can give any
reason of their belief; because they have not the Word of God preached unto them; upon
which accompt it is, that the Patriarch suffers them not to dispute of Religion, or inquire into
that of foreiners. Some few years since, a Monk of Nisenovogorod had some conference
with a Protestant Minister; but the Patriarch coming to hear of it, sent for him, and cast him
into prison, where he must have endur'd a great deal of misery, had he not had the wit to say,
that the Minister had discover'd some inclinations to the Muscovian Religion, and would, in all
likelyhood, be converted.
                  Their Characters they have from the Greeks, as well as their Religion; but as they have
altered the later, so also have they changed and augmented the former, as may be seen by the
Table we shall here give of them.

                  These Characters they make use of as well in their printed Books, as Writings, their Language
being peculiar to themselves, but coming so near the Sclavonian, and the Polish, that he
who hath one will find it no great difficulty to learn the other. It hath nothing common with
the Greek, though indeed in their Liturgy there are some words, borrow'd from the Greeks,
but they are not used any where else. We said before, that the Muscovites in their Schools
learn only to read and write in their own Language, and care not for the Learning of any other:
but within these few years, they have, with the Patriarch's consent, opened a School, where
Greek and Latine is taught, under the direction of a natural Grecian, named Arsenius. It is
not yet known, what may be expected from it, but certain it is that there are among the
Muscovites those that want neither ingenuity nor an inclination to Study, and would learn any
thing, did they but meet with any body to teach them. Almas Iuanouits, the present Chancellor,
or Chief Secretary of State, was so happy in his youth, as to have travell'd into Turkey
and Persia, and learn'd the Languages of those two Countries so well, that he needs no Interpreter,
when he hath ought to do with the Grand Seigneur, or King of Persia's Miinisters.
The Danish Interpreter we spoke of before, hath translated into their Language, certain Latin
and French Books, which have taken so well, that it is hoped, the Courtiers will, in time,
apply themselves to the study of those Languages, which can acquaint them with such excellent
things.
                  All their exercise of Religion consists principally, in Baptism, Reading of the Word of God
in the Church, going to Mass, praying to Saints, making reverences and inclinations before
their Images, Processions, Pilgrimages, Fasting certain dayes in the year, Confession and
Communion.
                  They think Baptism so much the more necessary,Their Baptism. in that they think it the only door through
which a man must enter into Christ, and so into Paradise. They acknowledge themselves conceived
and born in sin, and that God hath instituted Baptism for their Regeneration, and to
cleanse them, by water, from their original impurity. Whence it is that they baptize their
Children as soon as they are born. If the child be weak, he is immediately baptized, yet not
in the same room where the Woman lyes in: but if well, he is carried to Church by the Godfather
and Godmother. The Priest receives him at the Church door, signs him with the sign of
the Cross in the forehead, and gives him the Benediction, saying, The Lord preserve thy coming
in and thy going out. The Godfathers deliver the Priest nine Wax-candles, which he lights
and fastens cross the Font, which stands in the midst of the Church. He incenses the Godfathers,

and consecrates the water with many ceremonies. Then he makes a Procession together
with the Godfathers, who have wax-candles in their hands, about the Font. The Clark goes
before carrying the Image of St. Iohn, and they go about it three times, the Priest in the interim
reading out of a Book, That done, the Priest askes the Godfathers, the name of the Child,
who give it him in writing. He puts the paper upon an Image, which he holds upon the Child's
breast, and having muttered over certain prayers, he askes the God-father, whether the Child
believes in God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost? Then they all turn their backs to the Font,
to shew their aversion and horrour for the three questions which the Priest is to make them afterwards;
to wit, whether the Child forsakes the Devil, whether he forsakes his Angels, and
whether he forsakes his Works? The Godfathers answer to every question, yes, and spet so
many times upon the ground. That done, they face about to the Font, and then the Priest, having
asked them whether they promise to bring up the Child in the true Greek Religion, exorcises
him, by putting his hands upon the Child, saying, Get out of this Child thou unclean Spirit,
and make way for the holy Ghost, and by blowing three times cross, upon the Child, to
drive away the Devil, by whom they believe Children are really possessed before Baptism. I
I have been told, that now, the exorcism is performed at the Church-door, lest the Deuil, when
he comes out of the Child, should profane the Church. Then, he cuts off a little of the Child's
hair, and puts it into a Book, and having asked the Godfathers, whether they bring that Child
to be baptised, he takes him, being stark naked, into his arms, and dips him three times into
the water, pronouncing the ordinary words of the Sacrament, I baptise thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. After the Baptism, he puts a corn of Salt in the
Child's mouth, makes the sign of the Cross, in the fore-head, upon the hands, the breast, and
the back, with an Oil purposely consecrated for that use, and, putting a clean Shirt about him,
sayes, Thou art as clean and as clear from thy Original Sin as this Shirt. The Ceremonies are
concluded with a little Cross of Gold, Silver, or Lead, according to the ability of the Parents,
such as our Bishops wear, which the Priest hangs about the Child's neck, with so strict an Obligation
to wear it all his life time, that if it be not found about him at his death, they would
not bury the Carkass, but drag it to the common Dung-hill. The Priest does also assign the
Child a particular Saint, whose Image he delivers to the Godfathers, and charges them to oblige
the Child, when he is come to years of discretion, to have a particular devotion for his Patrone.
Then he embraces, and kisses the Child, and the Godfathers, and exhorts them to love
one another, but above all things that they take heed of inter-marrying. If it happens there are
many Children to be Christned at the same time, the Font is emptied so often as there are Children
to be baptised, and other water is consecrated; it being their perswasion, that the former
being soil'd with the impurity of that Child's Original Sin who had been baptised before, is not
fit to cleanse a second, much less a third. They will not by any means heat this water by fire
but, when it is very cold, put it into a hot place to make it a little warmer. Persons of age
that are to be baptised, such as Apostate Christians, Turks and Tartars, receive their Baptism in a
Brook or River, where they are plunged over head and ears, be it as cold as it will, nay sometimes
they break the Ice to get them into the water. Thus, above all others, are treated those
whom they call Chaldeens, or Chaldaeans. These are a sort of rascally fellows, who get leave
of the Patriarch to disguise themselves, by putting on Vizards, and to run up and down the
streets from the 18. of December, till Twelve-tide, with Fireworks, wherewith they set fire in
their hair and beards whom they meet. Their main spleen is against the Peasants, whom they
force, every time they are met, to pay a Copec ere they get out of their hands: and this they
exact with such insolence, that I have seen them set a load of Hay on fire, and burn the Peasant's
beard and face, because he made some difficulty to give it them. They are all disguis'd, and
have on their heads great wooden hats, fantastically painted, daubing their beards with honey,
that the sparkles might not fasten in them. These artificial fires they make of a powder which
they call Plaua, made of a certain herb not known elsewhere. It makes a noble and very delightful
flame, especially in the night. But of these hereafter, when we come to treat of the
Persian Fire-works. These men, as they say, represent those who heated the Oven, into which
Shadrach, Mesak, and Abednego were cast, by the command of Nebuchadnezzar.
                  These people are treated as profane persons, and are numbred among Pagans and Infidels; so
that being in a state of inevitable damnation, they must necessarily be reconciled to God, and
enter into the Church by Baptisme. To that end they pitch on Twelf-day, as that on which
sometimes happened the vocation of the Gentiles, and afterwards, they are as clean, and become
as holy as the best Christians, who are ordinarily baptized but once, whereas one of these
Chaldaeans may have been baptised ten or twelve times. The insolences committed by them occasioned
the prohibitions made by the late Pattriarch, that any should put on Vizards or disguise
themselves.
                  Those who are to profess the Muscovian Religion are oblig'd to go, for six weeks, into a Monastery,
where the Monks instruct them, and teach them their Prayers, the manner of honouring
the Saints, of doing reverence to the Images, and making the signs of the Cross. Then

they are brought to the place where they are to be baptised, where they are obliged to abjure
their former Religion, to detest it as Heretical, and to spit as often as it is named. After their
Baptism, they are clad in Muscovian habits, being presented with a noble Vestiment from the
Great Duke, who also allows them a Pension suitable to their quality.
                  There is a great number of Apostates at Moscou, where many forein Souldiers, especially
French, were rebaptised, after the War of Smolensko, about 25 years since, though they were
not acquainted with the Language of the Countrey, nor had any knowledge of the Muscovian
Religion. Which may in some measure be excusable in common Souldiers, who mind not
much what they are to expect in the other World; but my wonder is, how persons of Quality,
such as want neither Ingenuity nor Judgement, should be induc'd to Apostatize, and embrace
a contrary Religion, meerly for subsistence sake, as the Baron de Raymond, and Monsieur
Groin, French Gentlemen, Colonel Alexander Lesley, and Count Slakof. This last came in the
year 1640. to Holstein, and thence went into Denmark, where he pretended himself descended
from the house of Slick in Bohemia, and that he had lost his Estate upon the accompt of Religion;
which the King of Denmark, and the Duke of Holstein believing, gave him Letters of recommendation
to the Great Duke of Muscovy. He was no sooner come to Moscou, but he
gave out, that it was purposely to change his Religion, and to be a servant to his Czaarick Majesty.
The Patriarch, and Muscovian Lords were the more glad to receive him because he
was accompted among them, a person of noble extraction, and great worth, which yet was
further heightned in him by his being vers'd in several Languages, especially the Latin and Polish.
They receiv'd him with great joy, caus'd him to be baptis'd, and the Great Duke gave him,
with the name of Leo Alexander Slick, and the quality of Knez, a Pension of 200. Crowns a
moneth. He made his Addresses to the Princess Irene Michaelouna, and was so fond as to think,
the Great Duke would have bestowed his own Sister on him; so that hearing, there were two
persons of quality dispatch'd away to Negotiate the Princesse's marriage with a forein Prince,
he fell into such a melancholy, that he came not to himself again, till they had given him a
Daughter of one of the greatest Bojares in the Kingdom. The King of Denmark coming afterwards
to hear of this man's carriage, and understanding withall, that, far from being of the
Illustrious house of Slick, he was a subject of Count Gaspar's, of Denhof, in Poland, and that
he had surpriz'd him in his recommendatory Letters, he sent notice thereof to the Great Duke,
who reproach'd him with his dissimulation and imposture, but suffer'd him to enjoy what he
had bestow'd on him, which he does still, under the name of Knez Leo Alexandrouits Slakouseskie.
                  Colonel Lesley fell into that misfortune out of weakness. He had in that quality serv'd the
Great Duke, during the first War of Smolensko, by which he had gotten a very great sum of
money. But those of his profession being not alwayes the best husbands, he soon spent what
grew every day less and less. To repair the breaches of his fortune, he thought it his best
course to return to Moscou, which he did upon occasion of an Embassy which the Queen of
Sueden sent, some time since, to the Great Duke, whereof Eric Gillenstiern, a Senator of the
Kingdom was the chief. But for as much as there was at that time, no likelyhood of any War
in Muscovy, and that the Great Duke was unwilling to burthen himself with Pensions, Lesley
sent him word, that he would be content with some Lands, which he would make what advantage
he could of, and thereupon got a noble Mannor upon the Wolga. He was now in such a
condition, as that he might have lived like a Lord all the rest of his dayes, if his Wife's niggardly
humour had not exasperated the Countrey-women against them. She treated them so hardly,
that being not any longer able to endure it, they complain'd of her, alleging that she forc'd
them to eat flesh on fasting dayes, that she allow'd them not the time to make their inclinations
before the Images, much less to go to Church, and, what was worst of all, that she had taken
the Images from the Walls, and cast them into the fire. There needed no more to make her odious
to the whole Nation. They immediately sent for Lesley and his whole Family, and the
Countrey-women, and the Colonel's Wife were brought face to face; she confess'd indeed,
that she had forc'd them to work hard, but deny'd all the rest. All the Servants that were strangers
took their Oaths on her behalf, and yet the others proffering to make good their accusation
by enduring the torture, she could not so far clear herself, but that the Patriarch, taking cognizance
of the business, oblig'd the Great Duke to take those Lands out of the Strangers hands,
and to put out an act, whereby it should not be lawful for any to be possess'd of such Mannors
if they were not Muscovites, either by Birth or Religion. Lesley finding himself reduc'd to his
extremity, and having not wherewith to maintain his Children and Family, declar'd, that if
the Great Duke would continue him in the said Mannor, he and his Family would change their
Religion. They take him at his word, and he, his Wife and Children are put into a Monastery,
where they are instructed and re-baptized. Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski and his Wife were pleas'd
to answer for them at their Baptism, and to be at the charge of their Wedding, it being necessary
they should be married a-new. The Great Duke made them great Presents, and, among other
things, bestow'd on them, the sum of six thousand Crowns in ready money. But the Peasants

hearing, that, by this change of Religion, they were to be reduc'd to their former slavery, petition'd
His Majesty that they might have another Lord, and pitch'd upon Monsieur Groin, who
had revolted at the same time, and had some pretence to those Lands, as having had a promise
made him of some of that nature. So that Lesley was forc'd to content himself with a Pension
of 90. Crowns per mensem, which is the ordinary pay of a Colonel in times of Peace, and another
somewhat less for his Son.
                  I shall here make a short digression for a Lady's sake,The admirable constancy of an English Gentlewoman. who hath, by an admirable constancy,
made it appear, that, if Men are many times subject to the weakness of Women, it sometimes
happens that Women have those Virtues which may be exemplary to Men. There is this to be
said in commendation of the Muscovites, that they never force any to profess their Religion,
unless that in a Family, the Husband or Wife be of it, in which case they suffer not the other
to continue his former profession. We said, the Baron de Raymond was one of those that
chang'd their Religion after the first War of Smolensko. He was married to an English Gentleman's
Daughter (who had liv'd many years at Moscou, and whose name was William Barnesley,
being the handsomest Woman of any Stranger that was in the Country) and had chang'd
his Religion rather out of fickleness, and to comply with the Great Duke, than out of any conscientious
motive, was re-baptised, and took the name of Iuan instead of that of Peter, which
had been given him at his first Baptism. According to the Law of the Country, his Wife was
to follow his Example, which to effect, her Husband used all means imaginable, but found so
great a constancy on the other side, that he was forc'd to recurr to the Authority of the Great
Duke and Patriarch. These at first went mildly to work, offering her very great advantages in
their Religion: but the young Gentlewoman, though but 15. years of age, was inflexible, cast
her self at the Great Duke's feet, and entreated him rather to take away her life, than force her
to embrace a Belief, which she was not satisfy'd of in her Conscience. The Father us'd the same
submissions, but the Patriarch put him off with kicks, and told him that she was to be treated
as a Child, that she knew not what was for the good of her Soul, and that she must be baptized
whether she would or no. Accordingly she was put into the hands of certain Religious Women,
who violently dragg'd her to a Brook, where she was re-baptized, notwithstanding the
protestations she made, that that pretended Baptism, which they then gave her against her own
consent, could not blot out the Character, which her first true Baptism had imprinted in her
Soul. When they plunged her in the water, she drew one of the Religious Women in along
with her, and when they would oblige her to detest her former Religion, she spit in their faces,
and would never abjure. After her Baptism, they sent her to Stuatka, where her Husband
was Weywode, and there she stay'd till her Husband's three years Government was expired, who
dying soon after his return to Moscou, she thought she might re-assume her former Habit, as
she was a Stranger, and profess her former Religion, which was the Protestant. But that
would not be permitted, her two Sons were taken from her, and she, with a little Daughter,
was sent to the Monastery of Belossora, some 10. or 12. leagues from Moscou, where she liv'd
five years among the Nuns, and was never suffer'd to speak with any one that could give her the
least account of her Friends, or Children. During all that time, she heard from them but once,
by the means of a Tiler, a German, who, under pretence of calling his Boy, and shewing him
the Tiles he wanted, directed the disconsolate Lady to a place where she should find Letters.
The Patriarch dying, she got out of the Monastery, and his Successor allow'd her the liberty of
her Conscience at her own House, as also to give and receive visits: but they would never permit
her to go to Sermons. I often visited her while she was in that condition, and have heard,
that this Virtuous Lady died some two years since, firm and constant in the profession of her
Religion to the last gasp. To which I may add, by the way, that it is not long since, that her
Father William Barnesley died in England, having attained the age of 126. years, after he had
married a second Wife, at 100.
                  Those Muscovites, who change their Religion in other Countries, and would return to
their Communion, must be first re-baptized; which is the more observable, in that the Greek
Religion, though she approves not the Baptism of the Latin Church, yet seems to be satisfy'd
with the former which they might have receiv'd in their Church, so as not to oblige Converts
to re-baptization upon their change of Religion.
                  Their Festivals and Feasts are regulated and certain, and they observe them very strictly.
Till within these few years, the Muscovites thought they kept Holy-day well enough, when
they had been at Mass in the morning, though they spent the rest of the day in their ordinary
Employments; insomuch that at the time of our first Embassy, upon Sundayes, and Holy-dayes,
shops were open, and Merchants and Tradesmen were at work; it being, as they said, only
for great Lords to mind their enjoyments upon Holy-dayes. But the present Patriarch, hath
ordered shops to be shut, not only upon Sundayes, but also on Wednesdayes and Fridayes,
which are their Fasting dayes, not permitting the Taverns to sell Wine or Aquavitae in Service
time.
                  Their great Festivals, besides Sunday, are thirteen, and, according to their year, which begins
the first day of September, stand in this order;
                  
                     
The 8. of September, Prasnick rosostua priziste bogorodice, that is to say, the Feast of the Nativity
of the Blessed Mother of God.
                  The 14. of September, Vzemirna wosdui senja Chresta; The Exaltation of the Cross.
                  The 21. of November, Vedenja priziste bogorodice, the Oblation of the blessed Mother of
God.
                  The 25. of December, Rosostua Christoua, the Nativity of our Lord.
                  The 6. of Ianuary. Boje jaulenia, or Creschenia, the Epiphany.
                  The 2. of February, Stratenia Gospoda Boga, Candlemas-day.
                  The 25. of March, Blagauescenia priziste bogorodice, the Annunciation of our Lady.
                  Werbna Woscreschenia, Palm-Sunday.
                  Welikoiden, or Woscreschenia Christoua, Easter-day, or the Resurrection of Christ.
                  Wosnescenia Christoua, the Ascension of Christ.
                  Schiestuie swetaga Ducha, Pentechost, or the sending of the Holy Ghost.
                  The 6. of August, Preobrosiena gospodo Christoua, the manifestation of the Glory of Iesus
Christ, upon the Mountain.
                  The 15. of August, Vspenia priziste bogorodice, the Ascension or Assumption of the Mother
of God.
                  They celebrate the Feast of the Trinity, the morrow after Pentecost, and that of All-Saints,
upon the Sunday following.
                  No day in the year but is the particular Feast of some Saint, sometimes of two or three, but
the people observe them not. Only Ecclesiasticks are oblig'd to say the Offices of those dayes.
They have their perpetual Almanack, according to the Old-stile, wherein, without any trouble,
they find all the Feasts both moveable and immoveable.
                  Upon the great Festivals and Sundayes, they go thrice to Church; first in the morning, before
day, to Mattens, which they call Sasterim; at noon, to the Obedny; and in the evening,
to Wadschemi, or Vespers. The whole Service consists in the reading of certain Chapters out
of the Bible, Psalms, and St. Athanasius's Creed: whereto they sometimes add a Homily out
of St. Chrysostome, and certain Prayers, which they sing, much after the same manner as Antiphona's
are sung, saying ever and anon their Gospodi Pomilui, Lord have mercy upon me, which
the people repeats three times, making the sign of the Cross. This done, the Priest goes up to
the Altar, attended by a Clerk, and sayes the Office, according to the Liturgy of great St. Basil.
He pours Claret-Wine and Water into the Chalice, with some little bits of Bread, consecrates
them, and sayes certain Prayers, which ended, he takes out the Bread with a spoon, but
gives not of it to any other, unless some sick Child be brought, to whom he gives the Communion.
If the Priest hath known his Wife that day, he is not to come near the Altar, but must
get Mass said by another. The people stand all the service time, and incessantly bow themselves
before the Images, pronouncing the Gospodi Pomilui. They read only the bare Text of the Bible,
and certain Homilies, as we said before, giving this reason for it, that the Holy Spirit having
grounded the Church upon the pure Word of God, without any explication, neither are
they to trouble themselves with any, since that the different interpretations of it, do partly occasion
the Errours and Heresies, whereby the Church is divided. About five years since, the
Protopope of Morum, taking upon him to Preach, and making use of God's Word, to exhort
the people to Piety, the Patriarch deposed him, together with all the other Priests that would
have follow'd his example, excommunicated them, and banish'd them into Siberia.
                  They have made a certain Book, wherein they treat the Histories of the Gospel after a strange
manner, and adulterate them with so many fabulous, impious, and impertinent circumstances,
that it is not to be much admired that vice and sin reign among them, when they are furnish'd
with examples thereof in their Books of Devotion. This minds me of a story, which the Danish
Gentleman, I have elsewhere spoken of, relates in his Travels into Muscovy. Discoursing one
day with his Pristaf, concerning matters of Religion, the Muscovite, whose name was Foedor,
a man well stricken in years, told him, that there was no great harm in contracting a habit of
sinning daily, provided a man had an intention to repent him of it at the point of death, and
brought for his reason the example of Mary Magdalene. This Mary, said he, was a profess'd
Curtezan, so that it is not to be doubted but she offended God very often. Yet it happened one
day, she met a man upon the high-way, who desired of her that kindness which she had not deny'd
any other: but, those even of her profession being not alwayes in the same humour, she
would do nothing, till such time as the man desir'd her to do it for God's sake: That then she
satisfy'd his desire, and that doing, for God's sake, what she was unwilling to do out of complaisance,
the action became so meritorious, that she had not only expiated all her other Sins,
by that Act of Charity, but also deserv'd to be put in red letters in the Books of the Saints.
There is no Evangelical story which they have not thus adulterated, and dress up in circumstances
no less abominable.
                  They are all bare in the Church, even the Great Duke himself. Only their Priests have on
their Skufia, or Caps, which are given them at their Consecration. VVhen they make their Inclinations

to the Images, they often make the sign of the Cross, with three fingers of the right
hand, touching, first, the fore-head, then the breast, then the right shoulder, and lastly the
left. And that it might not be thought this is done without Mystery, they say, the three fingers
signify the Trinity, putting them to the fore-head, they would signify, that Christ is Ascended
into Heaven; to the breast, that a man should love God with all his heart; and the passing
of them from the right shoulder to the left, puts them in mind of the day of Judgement,
when God shall place the Righteous on his right hand, and the Wicked on the left; those, to
be called to eternal Salvation; these, to be tumbled down into the abysses of Hell. The Muscovites
undertake not any thing, but they first make the sign of the Cross, as eating, drinking,
or any other civil actions.
                  As for Images,Their Images. they confess there were not any in Churches, during the first Centuries, and
till the time of Constantine the Great, or if there were, they were not honoured with any worship;
but that they are used, only to represent the stories of the Bible. They say, that they
follow herein the opinion of Iohn Damascene: but it is most likely they have it from the Greek
Church, with which, they suffer not any that are carved or graven, as being forbidden in the
Decalogue, but they have Images painted with oil upon wood, wretchedly coloured, and illproportioned,
about a foot in breadth, somewhat more in length. They will not meddle with
them if they are not made by one of their Religion, though they came from the best Painter's
hand in Europe. At Moscou, there is a particular Market-place for Images, where nothing else
is sold, though they call that kind of Commerce, bartering or trucking with money, out of a
belief they have, that the names of buying and selling carry not respect enough in them, for sacred
things. Heretofore they oblig'd strangers to have of them in their houses, that their Muscovian
Servants might be thereby excited to the exercise of their Devotion: But the present Patriarch
permits not, they should be profaned by the Germans; insomuch, that Charles du
Moulin, having bought a stone house, the Seller scrap'd the wall, where an Image had been
painted, and carried away what he had scrap'd off. The Peasants would not permit us to touch
them, not to turn our feet towards them when we lay down. Nay, some were at the charge of
Incense to purify them, after we had left their Houses.
                  The walls of their Churches are full of them, and they represent, for the most part, our Saviour,
the Virgin Mary, St. Nicholas, Patron of Muscovy, or the particular Saints they make
choice of for the principal object of their Devotions. Those who commit sins deserving excommunication,
are oblig'd to cause their Saint to be taken away, who is not to be suffer'd in their
Churches, no more than their persons. Great Persons, and Rich Merchants adorn their Images
with Pearls and other precious Stones. All Muscovites look upon them as things so necessary,
as that without Images they could not say their prayers; which whenever they do, they alwayes
set Wax-candles before their Saint, and look very stedfastly upon him, as long as the Devotion
lasts.
                  When a Muscovite comes into a House, or Chamber, he saies not a word, till he hath fixt
his eyes on the Saint he looks for, which they ordinarily hang in a corner behind the Table, or
if he finds him not, he askes, Iest le Boch, where is the God? Assoon as he perceives him, he
makes him one very low reverence, or more, and pronounces at every time, Gospodi Pomilui:
then he turns to the Company and salutes them.
                  The Muscovites respect their Images, as if there were somewhat of Divinity in them, and
they attribute unto them the virtue of Miracles, whereof we had this example in the year 1643.
that an old Image beginning to change colour, and to turn a little reddish, they immediately
cry'd out, a Miracle. The Great Duke and the Patriarch were frighted thereat, as if that red
colour presag'd some misfortune to either the Prince or the people; nay, they had sent out Orders
for extraordinary fasts and publick prayers to be made all over the Kingdom, if the Painters
who were sent for to have their advise in this affair, had not all assured them, that there was nothing
they should be troubled at, since there was nothing extraordinary, but that Time, having
consum'd and eaten out the paint, had only discover'd the first colour of the wood, which
was red.
                  Their Monks and Priests have nevertheless the art to make them do Miracles, or to observe
such things in them as oblige the people to extraordinary Devotions, which must not want their
offerings, that the Priest may not want his advantage. The City of Archangel furnishes us with
a good example to this purpose, of two Priests there, who, having got together a vast sum of
money by their Impostures, must needs fall out at the parting of it, and upbraid one another of
their cheats, so loudly, that the Magistrate coming to hear of it, they had thirty lashes a-piece,
with the Executioner's good will, after the manner we have before described their whipping.
These Juglers put the people into continual frights, and besot them with so strange a veneration
for their Images, that in their greatest dangers, their recourse is only to them. Iacob de la
Gardie, General of the Suedish Army, having in the year 1610. taken the City of Novogorod,
some part of it was set a-fire, and one of the Inhabitants seeing his House all of a flame, presented
thereto an Image of St. Nicholas, entreating it to stay the progress of the furious Element,

which was ready to ruine him. But perceiving the fire went on still, he flung his Image into it,
saying to it, that since it would not help him, let it help it self, and quench the fire if it would.
It was then also observ'd, that the Suedish Souldiers, not finding any thing in their Houses,
carried away the Images of the Muscovites, and by that means oblig'd them to follow them,
and to redeem their Saints at a very dear rate.
                  The first thing they teach their Children, is to make their reverences and inclinations to the
Images. At Ladoga I lodg'd at a Womans House, who would not give his breakfast to a Child
she had, who could hardly either stand or speak, till he had first made nine inclinations before
the Saint, and as often, as well as he could pronounce it, said his Gospodi.
                  Nor is it to be thought, but that among so great a number of innocent persons, there are
some so well instructed, as to see a glimpse of truth through these thick Clouds of ignorance.
There was at Russian Narva a rich Merchant, who is still living, one that came often to visit
the Ambassadors, and dined with them. He discours'd very rationally, and would say, that
he did not approve the opinion, which the rest of the Muscovites have of their Saints, nor
the worship of their Images, and he did not expect his Salvation from Colours, which he
might wipe out with his handkercher, and from wood, which it was in his power to cast into
the fire: That he found in the Holy Scripture, which he had attentively read over, much more
solid comforts, and such foundations for his happiness, as could not be shaken: That their
Fasting signify'd nothing, when, instead of eating Flesh, they glutted themselves with the best
sorts of Fish, and the most delicious Hydromel, and Aquavitae: That bread and water might
suffice those who were desirous to fast, and that prayer was the best part of that mortification.
The Ambassadors ask'd him, why, having all these good sentiments about him, he had not
withall the Charity to inspire them into his Country-men? He answered, that it was not his
calling, and that, if he endeavour'd it, he should not prevail, because he was already look'd
on as a Heretick among them: That he suffer'd Images in his House, but, only for the honour
of God, and to honour the memory of the Saints: That he had a Picture of the King of Sueden's,
and kept it, for the Heroick actions done by that Prince, and that he conceiv'd he might
do the like with those of Iesus Christ and the Saints, who had not only done great actions, but
also Miracles. We found by the sequel of his discourse that he knew all the reasons alleged by
the Greeks at the Council of Constantinople against those whom they called Iconomachi, in the
year 787. against which Council Charlemaign called, in the year 797. that of Frankford, in
which the Doctrine of the Greeks concerning Images was condemned and anathematized.
                  Not long since, a Protopope of Casanskey, whose name was Iuan Neronou, began to inveigh
against the honour done to Images, charging those with Idolatry who worshipped Colours
and Wood. He said, that if there were any veneration due to Images, that they were rather
to admire, in man, that of God, and to honour the Painter, rather than the Images made
by him. But the Patriarch soon took an order with this Priest, degraded him, and shut him up
in the Monastery called Cameno Monastir, upon the River Wolga.
                  When the wood of their Images comes to rot, they do not cast it away, but throw
it into the River, that the water may carry it away; or they bury it in some Garden,
or Church-yard.
                  The Saints of Muscovy, as well as those of other places, have their Miracles. Possevin
says, they are all Fables, and that the stories related of them are ridiculous. They have one
of a very late date, named Sudatworets Philip Metropolite, of the House of Colitziou. He lived
in the reign of the Tyrant Iohn Basilouits, and grew famous for the remonstrances he made
to that Prince of his wicked life. The Tyrant, troubled thereat, sent him into a Monastery far
from Moscou, so as that he might be no longer importun'd with his reproaches: but the other
made the Pen do what his tongue could not, and, from time to time, represented the Judgement
of God to the Eyes of the Great Duke, so pressingly, that the other not able any longer
to endure his reprehensions, sent one of his Servants to strangle him. The Executioner found
him ready enough to dy, with this desire only, that, instead of strangling him with a Cord,
he would run him with a Knife into the Heart; which he accordingly did. The Monks of the
Monastery put him into the Catalogue of their Holy Martyrs, and sent his Body to be buried
in the Island of Solofka, in the White Sea, near Archangel, where they say he hath done many
Miracles. The present Patriarch perswaded the Great Duke, that, while he was Metropolitane
of Rostou, and Iarislau, he had heard that many sick persons had been healed there, and
that the Body of the Saint was as whole as the day he was kill'd, and prevail'd with him to have
it translated from Solofka to Moscou. The Miracles which are known to have been really done
at the translation thereof, are these: viz. that Knez Michael Levontgewits, who was employ'd
to see it done, going thither with a Diak, and his two Sons, and having embark'd himself
with some of his retinue in a great open Boat, he got safely into the Island, but it could
never be known what became of the three others, and all those that were with them. The other
Miracle was, that the Great Duke, the Patriarch, and all the Court going a league out

of Moscou, to meet the Saint, the Metropolitane of Rostou and Iaroslau, named Warlam, being
a corpulent fat Man, and about 70. years of age, wearied with so small a Journey, fell down
stock-dead, As soon as he came to the shrine. Which at least, is as certain as what the Muscovites
say of the great number of the blind, dumb, deaf, lame, persons troubled with agues,
and paraliticks, whom that body hath healed, since it was placed in the great Church of the
Castle. At first, no week pass'd, but it did five or six Miracles: but now it doth not any at
all, and they say it is by reason of the incredulity of the people, that that Virtue hath left the
Saints Body; which they say is still intire: but it is forbidden, upon pain of death, for any
man to lift up the cloath which covers it.
                  In the Monastery of Troitza, 12. leagues from Moscou, they have another Saint named Sergius.
He was a very tall man, a thing the Muscovites have a great veneration for, and had sometime
been a Soldier; but the crimes and disorders he had committed in his youth, touch'd his
Conscience so to the quick, that he forsook the World, and turn'd Hermite. He quitted that
solitary kind of life, and got into the Monastery of Troitza, where he was soon chosen Igumine,
or Abbot, and did there, with his Disciple Nikon, so many Miracles, that, dying in the year
1563. they were both Canonized. They say, their heads are there yet to be seen intire, and
that when the Polanders besig'd that Monastery, the head of Sergius only, forc'd them back in
the midst of their assault, and made them turn their arms against themselves. Of which yet there
is nothing to be found in the History of that time, which speaks but of one siege of Troitza, under
Iohn Sapiha, a Polish General, who was indeed forc'd to raise it, not upon the vigorous resistance
of the Monks, or by the assistance of Sergius, but by the Suedish Army, which came in to
the relief of the Muscovites.
                  Since this Saint was buried there, that Monastery hath been called Zergeofski Troitza, though
it be properly dedicated to the Trinity. It is so rich, that it maintains above 300. Monks, and
its revenue increases dayly, through the Great Duke's liberality, and the alms of those who go
thither to perform their Vows, they had made in their travels or sickness; and settle Annuities
for Service to be said after their death. The Great Duke, who goes thither twice a year, lights
off his Horse when he is come within half a league of the Monastery, and so walks it. Having
ended his Devotions, he spends some dayes there in Hunting, during which, the Abbot maintains
him and his retinue, both with Man's meat and Horse meat.
                  Some years since, the Muscovites found an Image of the Virgin Mary, at Casan, and sent
a copy of it to Moscou, where there is a Church built for the reception of it in the Marketplace,
near that street where the Cutlers have their shops. The Church is called Precista Casanska,
the holy mother of Casan, and many Pilgrimages are made to it. They go also in Pilgrimage
to the Monastery of Chutina, a league and a half from Novogorod, to the Sepulchre of
their Saint Warlam, who was born at Novogorod, and buried at Chutina, whence they call his
Festival, Prasnick Warlama Chutinskoga.
                  As to their Churches,Their Churches. we said, there were above two thousand Churches and Chapels in the
City and Suburbs of Moscou. Those which are of stone are round and vaulted, because God's
Houses ought to represent Heaven which is his Throne. They have neither Seats nor Benches,
by reason none sit down, but all say their prayers either standing or kneeling. The late Great
Duke, who was much given to Devotion, lay all along upon the ground, when he said his prayers.
They have no Organs or other musical instruments in their Churches, not using any, out
of this perswasion, that things inanimate cannot glorify God; That they were allow'd in the
Paedagogy of the Law, but that, under the new Testament, they were no more to be used than
any other of the Jewish Ceremonies. The Patriarch that now is hath shewn his enmity to Musick,
yet greater, in prohibiting the use of all those musical instruments, which the Muscovites
were wont to make use of at their merry meetings. Some four or five years since, he caused all
private houses to be search'd, for Instruments, and having loaden five Wagons with them, he
sent them over the River of Moscou, where they were all burnt. Only the Germans kept
theirs, nor could the Patriarch, with all his Authority, oblige the Bojar, Boris Nikita Iuanouits
Romanou. to put away his Musicians. There is no Stone-Church, but hath, in the midst of
four Turrets, a Tower form'd at the top much like the Knobs we set on Bedsteads, having upon
it a triple Cross, by which they say they represent our Saviour, as Head of the Church, saying,
that the Cross being the Badge of Christianity, it is necessary the Church of Christ should be
known by it. They hold, they are prophaned by Strangers, that is to say, such as are not of
their Communion; upon which account it was, that when, at the beginning of our Travels,
we entred into them, they came and thrust us out, and many times they swept after us. If it
chance a Dog gets in, they think it not enough to sweep the Church, but they also Incense it,
and purify it with holy Water. They have also very much respect for their Church-yards, and
suffer not that any should make their water in them.
                  Their Bells are not in steeples, but in a certain Engine, or Machine, near the Church, in the
Church-yard, and are for the most part so small, that few of them are 150. or 200. pound
weight. They toll them at the beginning of service, and at the Elevation of the Chalice, for

the Bread being put in immediately after Consecration, they make but one Elevation. The
Rope is not fasten'd to the Bell, but to the Clapper, so that one man may toll three or four
Bells at the same time, if the Ropes be fasten'd to both his Elbows and both his hands, which,
making a certain chiming, the Muscovites are much taken with. But this kind of chiming of the
almost infinite number of Bells, which they many times toll at the same time in all their
Churches, makes a very strange noise, to their ears, who are not accustomed thereto.
                  They think this chiming so necessary, that, without it, the divine Service would be defective.
Upon which perswasion it was, that a certain Pristaf, who conducted the Suedish Ambassadors,
hearing that they were desirous to do their Devotions, it being Michaelmas- day, told
them, that he could not imagine what shift they would make to do it, since he had not, by
reason of the greatness of the Journey, brought any Bells along with him.
                  There is no Church but hath an Image over the door; and at every corner of a Street, and
upon all the Gates of the City, there are Images, before which the Muscovites make a halt
to say their Gospodi. They also address the Gospodi to the Crosses which are upon the Churches,
so that they goe through no Street, but they make a short stay to do their Devotions.
                  The Ecclesiastical Government consists of a Patriarch,Their Hierarchy. several Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Protopopes, and Priests. The Patriarch, among them, hath the same
authority as the Pope has in the Latine Church. The Patriarch of Constantinople had heretofore
the nomination of him. In time, he came to have only the confirmation of him; but now of
late; he hath lost both. Filaretes Nikitits, the late Great Duke's Father, was the last that
desired confirmation from the Patriarch of Constantinople. At present, the Patriarch of Muscovy
is chosen by the other Prelates, who meet in the great Church within the Castle, called
Sabor, and name two or three Prelats, of the most eminent for Learning and good Life, and
present them to the great Duke, who, after some conference with the Prelats, proceeds joyntly
with them, to the election; unless those that are named be all of such eminency, that they are
at a loss which to make choice of, and so forc'd to it by lott which course they took at the
Election of this last Patriarch. He was a Prelate of the Second Order, and hath been named,
with two other Metropolitans, upon the reputation of his good life. The lot falling upon him,
all those of the First Order were discontented thereat, so that they put it to the Lot a second
time, in which also it fell again to him: but the ambition of the other Competitors appearing
still in their countenances, the Great Duke was pleas'd to comply with them, and to put it to
the Lot a third time, which fell in like manner to the same Person, upon which all acquiesc'd.
His name is Nicon, and he had been before Metropolitan of Rostou and Iaroslou, and is now about
45 years of age. He lives within the Palace, where he hath built him a house of stone.
He keeps a good Table, and is a person of so pleasant a disposition, that he discovers it in those
actions that require the greatest gravity. For, a handsome Gentlewoman being presented to
him, for his Benediction, after she had been re-baptized, with several others of her Friends,
he told her, that he was in some doubt, whether he should begin with the kiss, which is given
to Proselites after their Baptism, or with the Benediction.
                  The Patriarch's authority is so great, that he in manner divides the Soveraignty with the
Great Duke. He is the Supreme Judge of all Ecclesiastical Causes, and absolutely disposes of
what ever concerns Religion, with such power, that, in things relating to the Political Government,
he reforms what he conceives prejudicial to Christian simplicity and good manners,
without giving the Great Duke any accompt of it, who, without any contestation, commands
the orders made by the Patriarch to be executed. He hath under him, four Metropolitans, seven
Archbishops, and one Bishop. The Metropolitans are those of.
                  
                     Novogorodskoi, and Welikoluskoy, who lives at Novogorod.
                     Rostoufskoy, and Iaroslauskoy, at Rostof.
                     Casanskoi, and Swiatskoi, at Cassan. And that of
                     Sarskoi, and Pondoskoy, who lives within the Castle at Moscou???
The Archbishops are, those of
                     Wologdskoi, and Weliko Premskoy, who lives at Wologda.
                     Resanskoi, and Moromskoi, at Resan.
                     Sudalskoi, and Torruskoi, at Susdal.
                     Twerskoi, and Cassinskoi, at Twere.
                     Sibirskoi, and Tobolskoi, at Toboleska.
                     Astrachanskoi, and Terskoi, at Astrachan.
                     Pleskouskoi, and Sborskoi, at Plescou.
                  
                  There is but one Bishop in all Muscovy, to wit, that of Comenskoi, and Cassieskoi, who
lives at Columna. The Patriarch hath about him an Arch-Deacon, who is as it were his Vicar-General,
and in the Castle of Sabor, he hath a Proto-Deacon. The other Ecclesiastical Orders
are distinguish'd into Proto-popes, Popes (or Priests) and Deacons. Those who make clean

the Churches, and toll the Bells, are called Pannamari. In their Monasteries they have Archimandrites,
Kilari's, and Igumeni's, who are their Abbots, Priors, and Guardians.
                  The Patriarch,Their Prelates marry not. Metropolitans, Archbishops and Bishops are not to marry, but make a Vow
of Chastity, for the time they shall continue in that Dignity, which, it seems, give them not
an indelible Character, as it does elsewhere, to those that are advanced to it. They are forbidden
to wear Rings on their fingers. They wear no Drawers, nor Shirts of Linnen-cloath, but
of Flannen, and do not ly upon Beds.
                  Those that enter into any Religious Order eat no flesh,How the Monks live. nor fresh-Fish, and drink neither Wine,
Aquavitae, nor Hydromel; but are oblig'd to content themselves with their Quas, though
when they are out of their Monasteries, they dispence with the rigour of that Law, and eat of
any thing that is given them, making use of their time so well that many times they are glad to
be carried home.
                  The ordinary Habit of the Patriarch,The Habits of the Ecclesiasticks. as also of the Metropolitans, Arch-bishops &c. and
even of their Monks, is a kind of black Cassock, over which they have an upper-Garment of
the same colour, not much different from those of the other Muscovites. Their Hoods, or covering
of the Head, is at least an ell and a half diameter, having in the midst a round piece, as
big as a Trencher, which hangs on the hinder part of the head. When they walk into the City,
they have in their hands a staff forked at the end after the form of a Right angle, which serves
them for a Crosier, and they call it Posok.
                  What a vast number of Priests and cclesiasticks there must be about Moscou, may be judg'd
by that of the Churches, of which not any, that ever so little exceed their ordinary Chapels,
but have three or four, or more Priests belonging to them. Those who are desirous to embrace
that kind of life, address themselves to the Patriarch, or first Metropolitane they can come to,
who examins them, and if he finds they can make a shift to read and write, and sing in the
Church, he gives them Orders, and an Attestation of their being received into the Priesthood.
At their Consecration, they are habited after the manner before mentioned, and have the hair
cut off on the Crown of their heads, on which is put a little Cap like a Callotte, which is the
only Character of their Priesthood. For they never take it off, but when they cut their hair,
and he, who fighting with a Priest, should make his Callot fall to the ground, would be severely
punish'd, and oblig'd to pay him the Bicestie, or a certain muct imposed upon him: whereas
otherwise a man may bang or cudgel one of that profession with the same impunity as he may
another, but to do it without any danger, he is only to take off his Callot, before he falls to
work with him, and when he hath sufficiently paid him, to be so respectful to him as to put it
on again.
                  The Protopopes and simple Priests are obliged to marry once,The Priests are oblig'd to marry. but cannot the second or third
time, unless they quit the Priesthood, They allege to this purpose the Text of St. Paul, 1 Tim.
3. where the Apostle sayes, that a Bishop should be the husband of one wife. Which place they
understand not of Bishops, though the Text expresly mentions them, nor yet in the least imagine
that the Apostle speaks of one wife in opposition to Polygamy; but infer thence, that there
is a necessity that the Priest should marry, that so he may be the husband of one wife. This
point of the marriage of Priests makes one of the principal differences between the Muscovites,
with all the Greek Church, and the Romane, which allows not the marriage of Priests. For
confirmation of their opinion, they allege, as what makes most for them, the fourth Canon of
the Councel, which was held at Gangres, in Paphlagonia, not long after that of Nice, which
Anathemizes those who make any difficulty to receive the Communion from the hands of a
married Priest. But the Muscovian Priests hold this besides, that they are oblig'd to be in the
state of marriage, before they take Orders, and that they are to marry a Maid, and not a Widdow,
or a Woman of a scandalous life: in which punctilio they are so circumspect, that if a
Priest, upon search made the the first night of his marriage, find that his VVife hath been defiled
before hand, he must either be divorc'd from her or from the Priesthood. The Priest who
hath given his VVife her benevolence in the night, is not to approach the Altar the next day:
and as so as a Priest is a VViddower, he is not to Administer the Sacraments any longer. He
may be present at the Offices of Fasterini and Vetzerni, but is not admitted to that of Obedni,
at which the Communion is receiv'd, and cannot give his Benediction to marriages. Those who
are not willing to live in that condition, and are weary of a single life, take up some other profession,
turn Merchants or Tradesmen, and marry again: and to do that, they are only to put
off their Sacerdotal habit, and their Callot. If they are too old to marry, they retire to a Monastery,
and there end their lives.
                  They have a great number of Monasteries,Their Mosteries. both for Men and VVomen, as well in Cities, as
up and down the Countrey, and they all in a manner follow the Rule of Great St. Basil. Indigence,
Age, Infirmities, Domestick discontents, and violence fill their Convents, rather than
Devotion. VVhen any embrace that kind of life of their own accord, if they are of ability,
they are permitted to carry some part of their Estates along with them into the Monastery, but
are obliged to leave the remainder to their Heirs. Heretofore the more superstitious sort made

over all they had, and the extravagance had so far prevail'd on many, that in time, the Monks
would have been Masters of the best part of Muscovy; if a course had not been taken to prevent
it. They have set hours for their service, and they say most of their prayers by Beads.
Their Austerity of life is very great, in as much as they live only on Salt-fish, Honey, Milk,
Cheese, Herbs, and Pulse, especially Cowcumbers, fresh and pickled, which they mince very
small, and eat with a spoon in some of their Quas. They have this common with all the other
Muscovites, that they can hardly write and read. Not one in ten can say the Lord's Prayer,
much fewer that are acquainted with the Creed and the ten Commandments. These Monks live
not so retired a life, but that they are seen in great numbers, both in Cities, and all over the
Countrey, where their employment is the same with that of the Peasants, from whom they
are distinguish'd only by their habit. It is also true, there are abundance of Anchorets, who
build Chapels upon the High-ways, and live in Woods like Hermits, subsisting only by the
Alms given them by Travellers.
                  They fast Wednesdays and Fridays,Teir asts??? and abstain so strictly from all kind of flesh, nay, even
from Eggs and Milk, that within these few years, some of the more devout would not use
any Sugar, because they know that there are whites of Eggs used in the clarifying
of it.
                  Their year consists of more fasting days than flesh days. For, besides the two days of every
week, and the Eves of great Festivals, they fast in Lent seven weeks together, though in the
first they eat Butter, Milk, and Eggs, and this week is their Carnaval, during which they commit
incredible excesses in drinking, and withall such insolences, as the Patriarch hath not yet
found any way to remedy. The next week, they eat only Honey, Herbs, and Pulse, and drink
only Quas and Water; they bath, and cleanse themselves from the impurities they had contracted
in their excessive debauches. All the rest of the Lent they live very temperately, and
the most devout eat no fish but on Sundays. Their second Lent begins eight days after Whitsuntide,
and lasts till St. Peter's tide. The third is from the first of August, to the 16th. and
the fourth, from the 12th. of November to Christmas. 'Tis true, there are some abate of this
great Austerity; but I never knew any Muscovite, who did not strictly observe abstinence
during the Lent. But as they will not by any means be dispens'd with as to that time, no not
in their greatest sickness; so can they not, on the other side, be perswaded to eat fish on Sundays
and Holydays out of Lent, as believing that it is of Apostolical institution that they should
eat flesh on Sundays, and that they are bound to observe the Rule which goes under the name
of St. Clement, in the Tomes of the Councels printed at Venice, which says, that an Ecclesiastick,
who fasts on Saturday or Sunday, is to be degraded, and if a lay person commit the
same fault, he is to be excommunicated. The same Rule which enjoyns them to abstain
from flesh in Lent, forbids them also medling with their Wives during that time, upon
special penalties.
                  Those who are come to years of discretion are oblig'd to go to Confession, before they Communicate.Their Confession.
There are very few but receive the Communion at Easter, and they prepare themselves
for it by extraordinary mortifications, for eight days together, during which they eat
nothing but a hard kind of bread, and drink only Water and Quas, which is so sowr, that it
causes gripings in the belly, and brings them in a manner to deaths door. They make their
Confession standing, in the midst of the Church, and before an Image, on which they have
their eyes fastned, as long as the Confession lasts, making a very particular recital of all their
sins, and at every sin expressing their remorse, and promising amendment. The Priest, with
the absolution, gives them a certain penance to do, which consists for the most part in pronouncing
several times the Gospody Pomilui, or in making a certain number of Reverences before the
Saints, abstaining from Women for a certain time, standing at the Church door: or, if the sins
be very hainous, he enjoyns them to make use of a Holy-water, which they Consecrate upon
Twelfth-day, and is kept by the Priests all the year long for that purpose, and not to be had of
them for nothing. They make accompt that that water hath the vertue to cleanse them of their
sins, and to restore them into the state of Grace.
                  They receive the Communion, ordinarily, upon Easter-Eve; at least they think it must
be done upon a fasting-day,Their Communion. and this they so strictly observe, that if one should Communicate
on the Sunday, yet is he not to eat any flesh that day. They Communicate in both kinds, and
mix water with the Wine. The bread they put into the Wine, taking out a morsel, together
with some of the Wine, with a spoon. The bread is leavened, and must have been made up
and baked by a Priest's Widow: which they think to be so Essential to the Sacrament, that one
of the principal causes of the Schism between the Greek and Latine Church, is, that the latter
makes use of unleavened bread contrary to the express institution of our Saviour, who, to abolish
the Ceremony of the Iews, who made use of unleavened bread, was pleased to take ordinary
bread. This Communion bread is about twice as big, and somewhat thicker than a Crown
piece, and hath in the middle the figure of the Crucifix. After the Priest hath Consecrated it,
he takes off that figure with an instrument made much after the fashion of a Launce, and puts it

up into a wooden box, which hangs above the Altar, that the Rats and Mice may not come at
it. When the Communion is to be Administred to a sick person, they take a little out of the
said box, upon which they pour three drops of Claret-wine, and put it into the Chalice, mingling
sometimes a little water, and so they give it the sick person with a spoon. But if, through
weakness or otherwise, he be not able to get down the bread, they give him only a little Wine
consecrated. In the ordinary Administration of the Communion, they make use of a sort of
Consecrated bread, of the same form as the other, but not bigger than a half Crown, from
which they also take away the Crucifix, and break it into as many pieces as there are Communicants,
cast them into Claret-wine, and put thereto a little warm water, because no doubt
but the blood and water, which came out of our Saviour's side, was so. They hold Transubstantiation,
and, at the Administring of the Sacrament, the Priest sayes these words: This is the
true body and the true bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath been given for thee, and for many
more, for the Remission of thy sins, which thou shalt take in remembrance of him. God bless thee.
The more devout sort sleep after they have receiv'd the Communion, that so they may not Sin
that day. What remains of the bread after Consecration serves for holy-bread. They call it
Kutja, and the Sunday following, the Priest gives a morsel of it to each of those who had
Communicated the week before. There is no Child so young but they give him the Communion;
but it is only when he is Sick, and then but in one kind, till he be seven years of age, and
then he is Communicated as the rest; for which they give this reason, that about that age one
begins to Sin mortally. No doubt, they have derived this custom from what was done in the
third age, wherein St. Cyprian sayes, that they Communicated Children immediately after baptism,
which custom was continued till St. Augustine's time. But in Process of time the custom
was changed, since that, as Nicephorus, the son of Calistus, who lived in the 14th. age, affirms,
that in his time, they gave those Children, who were learning the first Rudiments of the Sciences,
but only the Consecrated bread which was remaining after the Communion. In Muscovy,
they also give the Communion to distracted persons; but they only touch their lips with
the bread after it hath lain a while in the VVine.
                  The Priest who hath kiss'd a dead body, or been at the interment of any, can neither consecrate
nor administer the Sacrament that day, for they hold him to be defiled. Nor is it lawful
for him to Commnicate a VVoman in Child-bed, in the same room where she was delivered:
but she is obliged to get her self carried into some other place, and to be washed. Heretofore,
they were wont to send the Consecrated bread into the Countrey, to those places which were
destitute of a Priest; nay, they gave of it to such as intended to travel, or were going to the
VVars, who made their Confessions before their departure, and were to Communicate when
they had any convenience to do it, or were in any danger of death, so to make it, as it were,
their last Viaticum. Their custom of receiving the Consecrated VVine in the Church, and carrying
away the bread, to be taken at home; as also that practised by Anchoretes, who carried
away both to the places of their retirement, is so antient, that St. Cyprian, nay, even Tertullian
speaks of it, as a thing very ordinarily done in their times: but this kind of Communicating
is now absolutely abolish'd in Muscovy, as well as other places. Those who have taken their
Oaths in any Law business, or have committed murther, or any other hainous sin, are not to
receive the Communion, but at the point of death. All that are sick to that extremity are Communicated,
and at the same time receive extreme Unction, but that once done, they suffer them
not to take any thing else, not ought of nourishment, unless they apparently perceive that the
sick party begins to recover strength, and gives them a great assurance of the retrival of his former
health. Before the receiving of the Communion, they give those that are sick, some fair
water, or Aquavitae, wherein some Relicks had been put. There are those, who, in that condition,
cause themselves to be shaven, put on Monks habit, and become really such; for, that
once done, they are not suffer'd to take any thing for the space of eight dayes; it being their
perswasion, that those who take that habit, which they call Seraphick, are not to be numbred
among men, but are become Angels. And if, after those eight dayes abstinency, they recover
their former health, they are oblig'd to perform their vow, and to go into a Monastery, because
the Rasour hath pass'd upon their heads.
                  Their interrements are accompany'd by abundance of Ceremonies,Their manner of burial. as indeed are all their
publick actions. As soon as the sick person is departed, they send for all his Kindred and Friends,
who being come into the house stand about the body, excite one another to bemoan him, as it
were to heighten the Lamentations of the VVomen, and ask the deceased, why he would dye?
VVhether his affairs were in a good condition? VVhether he wanted meat and drink? VVhether
his VVife were not handsom and young enough? VVhether she had been unconstant to
him? &c. Then they send a present of Beer, Aquavitae and Hydromel to the Priest, that he
may pray for the Soul of the deceased party. The body is well washed, and after they have
put a clean shirt, or a shrowd about him, they put on his feet a pair of new shooes, of a very
thin Russia leather, and so lay him into the Coffin with his Arms cross the breast. Their
Coffins are made of the Trunk of a Tree, and are to be sold every where. It is cover'd with a

Cloath, or haply with some Coat of the deceased, and carried to Church. If it be a rich
man, and that the season of the year permit it, he is not buried so soon, but kept above ground
eight or ten dayes, during which, the Priest comes to incense the Corps, and cast holy water
on it every day.
                  The Funeral solemnity is after this manner. First there goes a Priest, carrying the Image of
the Saint which had been assign'd the deceas'd at his baptism for his Patron. Next go four Virgins,
of the next of Kin to the deceased, who are to go as Mourners, and who fill the air with
their horrid cries and lamentations, keeping such exact time, that they both give over, and then
begin all together. Then follows the body, carried by six men upon their shoulders; and if it
be a Monk or Nun, some of their own Profession do them that Office. The Priests go all about
the body, and incense it all the way, to keep off evil spirits, and withall sing certain Psalms.
The Kindred and Friends follow the body, but without any order, having every one a VVax-Candle
in his hand.
                  Being come to the Grave, the Coffin is uncover'd, and the Image of the deceased party's
Saint is held over him, while the Priest sayes certain prayers, in which there come often these
words, Lord look upon this Soul in Righteousness, as also some passages of their Liturgy, during
which the VViddow continues her lamentations, and makes the same questions she had done before.
Then the Kindred and Friends take leave of the deceased, kissing either him or the
Coffin; and at last the Priest comes up to him, and puts between his fingers a piece of paper,
which is a kind of Testimonial of his behaviour in this world, signed by the Patriarch, or the
Metropolitane of the place, and the Confessor, who sell those papers dear or cheap, according
to their abilities who buy them. This Testimonial, which is a kind of Pass for his admittance
into the other VVorld, runs thus. We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, the Patriarch, or
Metropolitane, and Priest of the Citie of N. do make known and Certifie, by these presents, that
the Bearer of these our Letters hath alwayes lived among us like a good Christian, professing the
Greek Religion; and though he hath committed some sins, yet that he hath confessed the same, and
that thereupon he hath received absolution, and taken the Communion, for the Remission of his sins:
That he hath honoured God and his Saints; That he hath said his prayers, and that he hath fasted
on the hours and dayes appointed by the Church, and that he hath carried himself so well towards
me who am his Confessor, that I have no reason to complain of him, nor to deny him the Absolution of
his sins. In witness whereof, we have given him the present Testimonial, to the end, that upon
sight thereof, St. Peter may open unto him the Gate of eternal bliss. As soon as he hath this Passport
given him, the Coin is shut up, and put into the Grave, with the face of the deceased
turn'd towards the East. Those who accompany'd him thither, do their Devotions to the Images,
and return to the house of the deceased, where they find Dinner ready, and where, many
times, they drown their affliction, with all other sentiments of mortality, in Hydromel and
Aquavitae. Their mourning lasts 40. dayes, during which they make three Feasts for the Kindred
and Friends of the deceased, to wit, the 3d. the 9th. and the 20th. day, after the burial.
VVherein they imitate the modern Greeks, though these, instead of the 20th. take the 40th.
day; upon this ground, that about that time, the heart corrupts, as the body begins to putrifie,
towards the ninth, and the face is disfigured, the third.
                  Some build Huts over their Graves, which they cover with Mat, for the convenience of the
Priest, who, morning and evening, for the space of six weeks together, is to make prayers
there for the deceased. For though the Muscovites do not believe there is any Purgatory, yet
they say there are two several places, to which the Souls retire, after their departure out of
the body, where they expect the day of Judgement: some in a pleasant and delightful place,
having the conversation of Angels; others, in a sad and dark Valley, having the society of Devils;
That the Souls being yet in their way, may be diverted out of the evil way, by the Prayers
of Priests and Monks, nay, that these have so great an Interest with God, as to obtain a certain
ease and alleviation of their misery, for those Souls which are with the Devils, and to appease
him against the day of Judgement. Such as are of ability, gives Alms dayly during the
six weeks; which may indeed be ordinary among the Muscovites, who make no difficulty to
inrich themselves any way, and believe that sin is to be expiated by Alms. VVhence it comes,
that no Muscovite almost, but, as he goes to Church, or about his occasions, buyes bread,
which he afterwards distributes among the poor, who, though very numerous, yet get so much,
that being not able to consume all themselves, they dry up the rest in an Oven, and make it a
kind of Bisket, which they call Suchari; and sell it in the Market to Travellers.
                  The Muscovites tollerate all sorts of Religions, and suffer all Nations to live among
them, as Calvinists, Lutherans, Armenians, Tartars, Turks, and Persians, excepting none, but
Iews and Roman Catholicks. There is a great number of Protestants all over Muscovy, and
in the City of Moscou it self, there are above a thousand, who have the free exercise of their Religion.
Those of the Reform'd Religion and the Lutherans, had their Churches heretofore in
the quarter of Czaargorod; but it is about twenty years since that the Lutherans lost theirs, by
the imprudence of their Wives: because those of Merchants would not give place to the Officers

wives, who indeed for the most part were but servant-maids dress'd up a little finer than they
had gone before: The contestation grew so high, that they came from words to blows, in the
very Church, with so much scandal, that the Patriarch, then accidentally passing by, having
understood the occasion of their falling out, commanded the Church to be demolish'd, which
was immediately done. But they were permitted to build another in the quarter of Bolsoigorod.
They took away their Church from those of the Reformed Religion, because, not content
with the wooden Chapel which had been given them within the White-wall, they would needs
build there an Edifice of stone, which was in a manner finish'd, when the Patriarch, who had
not given his consent for the doing of it, caused both to be pull'd down. Now, Foreiners have
neither Church nor Houses within the City. For the Germans finding themselves exposed to
the derision of the Muscovites, after the Patriarch had ordered them to go in a habit distinct from
that of the Inhabitants of the Country, to free themselves out of that persecution, Petition'd the
Czaar to protect them against the outrages and affronts they dayly received. On the other side,
the Priests complained, that strangers built on their foundations, and lessened the revenue of the
livings; so that the Great Duke, to please both sides, assigned them, without the City, near
the Gate called Pokrofki, a place big enough to contain all the Houses of Foreiners, who immediately
demolish'd those they had in the City, and in a short time made up that part of the
Suburbs, which is called Nova Inasemska Slaboda, where the Lutherans have two Churches,
and those of the Reformation two more, one for the Dutch, and the other for the English; and
where they have this further satisfaction, that they converse but little with the Muscovites,
and are out of all danger of those frequent fires, which commonly begin in the houses of those
barbarous Christians.
                  The Lutherans, and those of the Reformed Religion live very quietly together, and the Muscovites
Trade indifferently with either: but they have so great an aversion for the Roman Catholicks,
that they would never grant them a Toleration of their Religion in Muscovy. In
the year 1627. the late King of France proposed, by Louis des Hayes, a Treaty for the regulation
of Commerce with the French, and at the same time for a Church, where they might
have Mass said, but it was deny'd. And in the first War of Smolensko, they would not entertain
Catholick Souldiers. Nay, in the Treaty they made with us, for our passage into Persia, it
is an express Article, that we should not take any Roman Catholicks into our retinue. So that
it is much to be admired, that they should call to the Crown Vladislaus, Prince of Poland and
Sueden; though that Election came to nothing, for reasons, into which it is beside the subject
of our Relation to enquire, as it is also into those which may be given of the Animosity of the
Muscovites against the Roman Catholicks, whereof the grounds are to be searched for in Ecclesiastical
History, which hath nothing common with the Relation of our Travels, the prosecution
whereof is the business of the following book.

TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, TARTARY,
and PERSIA.
               The Fourth Book.
               LEaving Moscou, w we, by Land, as far as the Monastery of Simana, where
we embark'd, after we had taken leave of our Friends, who had accompany'd
us thither,JUNE, under the conduct of a Pristaf, named Rodiwon Matfeowits, who
had order to provide for the Ambassadors as far as Astrachan. We had hardly
quitted the shore, ere the Governor of the Prince, Boris Iuanouits Morosou
came in sight with his Trumpets, and intreated us to come ashore, and favour
him so far as to sup with him that night. But the Ambassadors, earnest to be on their Voyage,
excused themselves, and sent him, by way of Present, a silver Bowl. He receiv'd it in a little
Boat which came along by the side of ours, and express'd how kindly he took it, by the flourishes
of his Trumpets. But at last, not able to contain any longer, he came into our Boat,
where he staid all night drinking with the Gentlemen, at his parting from whom the next
morning, he could hardly forbear tears.
               Our Muscovian Mariners, whom the Aquavitae they had taken had made more lively and
lusty than ordinary, took such pains in the mean time, being always eight a-rowing, that the
next morning at Sun-rising, we were got as far as a pleasant Country house, called Duoreninou,
seated on the left side of the River, 80 Werstes, which make 16 German leagues, from
Simana. At night, we got 40 werstes, or 8 German leagues, from Duoreninou, to a Village
called Mortschuck; so that in 24 hours, we made so many German leagues.
               The next day, Iuly 2. about noon, near the Village and Monastery of Porsenis, we met with
several great Boats, loaden with Honey, Salt, and Salt-fish, coming, most of them, from
Astrachan, bound for Moscou.
               At night,Columna. we were come before the City of Columna. It lies on the right side of the River
Mosca, 180 werstes, or 36 German leagues from Moscou, though by Land there is but 18.
which may be travell'd in a short time, especially in the Winter, upon the snow. The City is
of a considerable bigness, and looks very delightful on the out-side, by reason of its Towers
and stone-walls, which are not ordinary in Muscovy. Nay it is indeed of that accompt, that
the Great Duke hath his Weywode there, which is not seen but in the chief Cities of Provinces.
We sent him our Pass-port, by the Pristaf, and immediately the wooden Bridge was full of
people; and whereas the covering of our Boat was too high to pass under the Bridge, they in a

trice took off one of the Arches, to make us way. We said in the fore-going Book, that there
is but one Bishop in all Muscovy, and that his Residence is in this City of Columna.
               Three werstes above the City, near the Convent of Kolutin Serge Monastir, founded by one
Sergius, a Saint among them, whom we have spoken of elsewhere, and who is buried at the
Monastery of Troitza, the Mosca falls into the River Occa, which is incomparably much more
delightful, and broader than the other. It comes from-wards the South, and hath on both sides
it a noble Country, well peopled, and very fruitful. Both shores are well furnish'd with Oaks,
which is a kind of rarity in those parts. Being got ashore, we had a Sermon under a great Tree,
which sufficiently shaded the whole Assembly.
               Presently after Dinner we embark'd, and left, about half a league on the left hand, a great
Island in the midst of the River. Afterwards, we pass'd by several Villages, namely those of
Scelsa and Moroso, which are bigger than any of the rest, and both upon the River side, on
the right hand.
               The 4. about noon,Peresla. we got to the City of Peresla seated upon the River side, upon the right
hand, 22. leagues and a half from Columna, at 54. degrees, 42. minutes, elevation. This hath
also its particular Weywode.
               The 5. we left on our right hand the Town of Rhesan.Rhesan. It was heretofore a gallant City, and
had given its name to the whole Province, but the Crim-Tartars destroy'd it, with the whole
Dutchy, in the year 1568. The Great Duke, considering the fertility of the Country, which
reaches from the River Occa, as far as the Trench made against the irruption of the Tartars,
got together, such of the Inhabitants as the invasion of the Barbarians had dispers'd, and having
caused Materials to be brought to a place eight leagues from it, he ordered the building of a
City there, which, to this day, is called Peresla Resanski, because there went thither many of
the Inhabitants of Peresla, which stands at an equal distance from Moscou North-wards, with
this South-wards. The Town of Rhesan still keeps the honour of having the Residence of the
Archibishop: but we are to correct their errour, who affirm, that the Province of Rhesan lies
West-ward from Moscou, since they themselves confess it is between the Rivers of Don and
Occa, which are not towards the West from Moscou, but towards the East: so that Rhesan
must be placed in the Map, South-ward from the City of Moscou.
               The same day, we pass'd in sight of several Monasteries, and Villages; as that of Seloy, neer
Rhesan, on the left hand; and 7. werstes thence, Kystrus, as also, on the other side, & 3. werstes thence,
the Monastery of Oblozitza; and 2. werstes thence, Lippono-Issado; at 2. thence, Muratou; at 1. thence,
Kallionino; and 2. thence, Schilko. Near the first Village we found a Carkass floating on the
water, which, in all likelihood, the Cosaques had cast into the River many dayes before, in as
much as it was so Sun-burnt, that it was become black. In the afternoon, we got four leagues.
               The 6. we made two, as far as the Monastery of Tericho, on the left hand; thence two more,
to Tinersko Slowoda, on the right hand; and afterwards 8. werstes, to Swintzus; and thence
2. werstes, to Kopanowo, where we found another dead Carcass: But the Cosaques, and the fugitive
Slaves, who retire into those parts, do there commit so many Villanies, that the Muscovites,
to whom those accidents are ordinary, thought it nothing strange.
               Iuly 7. betimes in the morning, we left on the right hand, an Island, called Dobrinin
Ostrow, 30. werstes, or 6. leagues from the last Village; and afterwards Seloy Rubets, at 7.
werstes thence; and, at 7. more thence, on the same side, Kurman. About 6. werstes thence,
we had on the left hand, the River Gusreca, and several other Villages, and on the right hand
Molcowa, at 8. werstes, Gabiloska, at two, and Babino, at three. Thence we made three werstes,
and came at night to Cassinogorod.Cassinogogorod. This City lies on the right side of the River Occa, in the
Principality of Cassinou in Tartary, and there it was we first met with any Mahometans. Not
far from the City, in an old stone Castle, which had sometime been a Fort, lived a young
Prince of that Country, whose name was Res Ketzi, with his Mother and Grand-father, who
some years before had put himself into the protection of the Great Duke of Muscovy We were
told, that the Great Duke, would have press'd him to receive Baptism, upon some hopes given
him that he should have married his Daughter, but the young Prince, who was but 12. years
of age, sent him word, that being not come to years, so as to make choice of any Religion, he
could not take a resolution of that importance. The Ambassadors sent two Gentlemen of their
retinue to give him a visit, and presented him with a pound of Tobacco, and a bottle of Aquavitae.
He took it very kindly, and made it his excuse, that he could not entertain the Ambassadors
at his house, left the neighbouring Weywodes should conceive any jealousy at his entertaining
of Strangers, without their permission. He therefore only sent some of his Servants to
us, whom our Interpreter could hardly make a shift to understand, they being all Tartars. He
sent us a present of two sheep, a Barrel of Hydromel, another of Beer, and a third of Aquavitae,
with some pieces of Ice, Cream and fresh Butter, which the Prince's mother had her self
taken the pains to beat.
               The night following, and the next day, being the 9. we saw, as we pass'd several Villages,
Monasteries and Taverns, most of them very pleasantly seated, amidst the woods; among others,

on the right hand Potsink Tartasko, three werstes from Cassinogorod, and at seven werstes thence,
Seloy Pettiowo, Then a Tavern, or Caback, at eight werstes, and Brooth, at five werstes one
from another, upon the left hand: and then on the right hand, the River of Moksche, at eight
werstes; then on the left hand, another Tavern; at two werstes thence, Sateowa; at 13 werstes,
the Monastery of Adrianou Pustino; at 13 more Ikatma. This last is a great Village, containing
about 300 houses, and belongs to the Bojar, Foedor Iuanouits Sheremetou. And thence we
got 20 werstes to the Forest of Rusbonor.
               The 9. we got ten werstes, to the Church of Worskressenia, commonly called Woskressenskimehl,
upon the left hand; and thence five werstes, to a great Village named Lechi, belonging
to Knez Boris Michaelouits Lycou, on the same side; and thence about ten werstes, to
Pretziste Resenskou, on the right hand; and at last to the City of Moruma, on the
left hand.
               Before we got to the City,The City of Moruma. we discover'd on the other side of the River a company of Crim
Tartars, who presently got into the woods, whence they discharg'd their Fowling pieces at us,
which we answer'd with Muskers, and so forc'd them to keep off. They were seen afterwards
below the City, whence we imagin'd, they would have set upon us the night following;
whereupon we lay under the Isle of of Zuchtsko Ostrou, and set a strong Guard; but we heard
no more of them.
               The City of Moruma,The Tartars of Mordwa. is the chiefest of the Tartars of Mordwa, and is inhabited
by Muscovites and Tartars, but subject to the Great Duke. VVe sent our Interpreter
to the Market to buy some provisions necessary, for the continuation of our
Voyage.
               The 10. we passed by the Town of Prewospalo, belonging to Knez Iuan Borissowits Circaski,
one of the Great Dukes Privy Councel, and left, on both hands, several little Villages, and
the River of Morsna Reka, on the right hand; and at eight werstes thence that of Clesna, which
comes from Wladimer. All along from that place, the shore on the right hand rises by little and
little, to such an extraordinary height, that looking on it from the water, it seems to be one
continued mountain, for above a hundred German leagues along the River Wolga. Insomuch,
that even in that season, as also in the greatest heat of Summer, those parts are not without Ice
and Snow, though all elsewhere, the Country is plain, fertile and fit for Tillage, reaching
above a hundred leagues towards the South-west, and on the other side, it lies very low, barren,
and moorish.
               Iuly 11. having pass'd by the pleasant Villages of Isbuilets, Troitska, Slowoda, the Monastery
of Dudina, and Nofimki, we got at night before the great and Noble City of Nise, or
Nisenovogorod, where we found the ship, called the Frederick, which we had ordered to be
built, by our Captain Michael Cordes, whereof we spoke in the beginning of our Relation. It
was not quite finish'd, by reason the Muscovian Carpenters, whom the Captain had employ'd
about her, had not answer'd his expectation; yet was it so far on, that the Ambassadors lodg'd
in it, and so forbore going into the City. It was built of Deal, being 120 foot long, and 40
broad, having three Masts, and so flat-bottom'd, that it took but seven foot water. It had
many Chambers and Closets, for the convenience of the Ambassadors, the Officers and Gentlemen
of their Retinue, and some Iron and Brass Guns, a great number of Granadoes and other
Fire-arms. And as our design was to make use of it chiefly upon the Wolga, which is full
of Banks and quick-sands, it was so built, as that if there were no wind, they might use Oars;
and to that end, it had twelve seats, two Oars to every seat. We had caused to be made a
double Shallop, for the conveniency of unlading the Ship in those places where it might want
water, as also to carry the Anchors, Cables, Sails, and other things necessary for so great
a Voyage, and to discover those Banks and Sands in the Caspian Sea, which might hinder or
retard its passage.
               We stayd almost three weeks before the City of Nisenovogorod, for the finishing of the Ship,
which time we spent in visiting our Friends in the City, where the chiefest Dutch Merchants
entertain'd us at several great Feasts, as also in reciprocally treating them in our Tent, which
we had pitch'd by the River side.
               Our stay there gave me the convenience to observe the elevation of that place,Nisenovogorod. which I found,
at the place where the River Occa falls into the Wolga, to be at 56 degrees, 28 minutes, and
that the Needle of the Compass declined there above nine degrees, towards the West. The
Great Duke Basili ordered it to be built at the conflux or meeting of those two Noble Rivers,
and gave it the name of Nisenovogorod, upon occasion of the Inhabitants of the great City of
Novogorod, whom he caused to be translated thither. This indeed is not so great as the other,
yet hath its Towers and Walls of stone. From Moscou to Nise are accounted 500 werstes, or
100 German leagues by Land; but by water, it is above 150. The Suburbs are much bigger
than the City, and are above half a league about. The Inhabitants are Tartars, Muscovites,
and Hollanders, of whom there are so many as make a Protestant Church of about 100. persons.
Iohn Bernarts, our Factor, was the chiefest man among them, the rest being, for the

most part, Military Officers, Merchants, and Victuallers, or Sutlers. The City is Governed
by a Weywode, who, at our passage that way, was Basili Petrouits, under the Great Duke-Provisions were so cheap there, that we bought a Pullet for a penny, a quartern of Eggs for as
much, and a Mutton, for 12. 15. or, at most, for 18. pence.
               Iuly 24. The Ambassadors sent Monsieur Mandelslo and my self, accompany'd by our Muscovian
Interpreter and the Pristaf, to the Weywode, to thank him for his civilities towards our
people, during the stay they had made in the City, while the Ship was a building, which was
almost a year, and to make him a Present of a Jewel worth a hundred Crowns. His reception
of us discover'd how magnificently he liv'd, and what a noble house he kept. For as soon as
notice was brought him that we were come near the house, he sent two very handsom compleat
persons to meet us at the Gate. They conducted us through a very long Gallery, and at the entrance
into the Palace it self, we met with two comely old men, richly clad, who brought us to
the Weywode's Chamber, who had on a Garment of Brocadoe, and was accompany'd by a great
number of persons of Quality. The Room was hung with Turkie Tapistry, and had in it a
great Cup-board of Plate. He receiv'd us with much civility, and having accepted the Present,
and answer'd our Complement, he desir'd us to take our part of a Collation, during which, his
Discourse was excellent good, and such as we thought the more extraordinary, in that the
Muscovites, for the most part, contribute very little to any thing of Conversation. Among
other things he asked us whether we did not fear meeting with the Cosaques, who in all likelyhood
would set upon us ere we got off the Wolga, and told us, they were a barbarous and inhumane
people, and more cruel than Lions, shewing us at the same time a Picture, wherein was
represented Sampson's engagement with one of those Creatures. We made him answer, that
we look'd on that Piece as a good omen, in as much as if the Cosaques were stout as Lions, we
should behave our selves, on the other-side, like Sampsons. The Weywode reply'd, that he had
that good opinion of us, nay-believ'd, that the repute our Nation had gain'd, by the services it
had done his Czaarick Majesty, would frighten the Cosaques, and hinder them from attempting
ought against us.
               The River Wolga is four thousand six hundred Geometrical feet wide near Nise, at the meeting
of the two Rivers; and whereas its waters encrease in the months of May and Iune, by
reason of the Sun's having melted the Snow, and thaw'd the Rivers which fall into it, the Boatmen
who go from Moscou to Astrachan, do commonly take that time, when there is water
enough to pass over the Banks of Sand, nay indeed the little Islands which are very frequent in
that River. This consideration, and the example of their misfortune, whose Boats we had seen
cast away, and half rotten upon the Sands, made us resolve upon our departure thence with the
soonest, before the waters, which visibly decreas'd, were fallen too low, and so we appointed
it should be the 30th. of Iuly.
               The Wolga,The Wolga. whereof we gave a short accompt in the precedent book, is, in my opinion, one
of the noblest and greatest Rivers in the World, its course being of a vast extent, from its source
to the place where it falls into the Caspian Sea, below Astrachan. Whence it came that I took
a delight to observe all the particularities thereof, from League to League, and from Werste to
Werste, with all possible exactness, and with the assistance of a Dutch Master's-mate, named
Cornelius Nicholas, one of the most able I ever came acquainted with in that Science, as also of
some Muscovian Pilots, I have drawn a very exact Map of it, which I had made the World a
promise of some years since, but now part with it, so well done, that I hope the Judicious Reader
will be satisfy'd therewith.
               Having bought Provisions for our Voyage as far as Astrachan, we left Nise the day before
named, having only a side wind. Mr. Balthasar Moucheron, Commissary, or Agent from his
Highness of Holstein about the Great Duke, the Weywode of Nise's Secretary, the Pastor of the
Lutherans Church there, and our Factor, Iohn Bernarts, would needs accompany us some
Werstes, to see the beginning of that long Voyage: but we had hardly got two Werstes, ere we
were a ground near the Monastery of Petsora, and forc'd to cast Anchor, while the men were
getting off the ship, which took them up four hours.
               Iuly 31. Having made about a Werste, the Ship touch'd against a Sand-bank, but was soon
got off, and we had continu'd our course, if the contrary wind, together with a Tempest, had
not oblig'd us to cast Anchor. This interval we spent in our Devotions, to give God thanks for
his miraculous deliverance of us the year before, when we were wrack'd upon the Baltick Sea.
Having entertain'd our friends with a Dinner and Musick, they took leave of us, and return'd
that night to Nise.
               August 1.AUG. The Ambassadors ordered what Guard should be kept all along the Wolga. Those
who are able to bear Arms, both Soldiers and Servants, were divided into three Companies,
under the Command of the 2. Ambassadors, and the Steward of the Embassy. The Ambassadors
had each his Captain Lieutenant, Mr. Crusius, the Master of the Horse, and Brugman, the
Secretary of the Embassy, who went to Guard every day alternately, set Sentinels at the fore-Castle
and the Stern, and had their Court of Guard at the main Mast. The same day we made

                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  

                  
                  
use of our Oars,1636. the wind being against us; but we had hardly made 500 Paces, ere the ship
struck again upon the Sand. Most of our Gentlemen went ashore, and had good fowling; for
the High-Country between Nise and Cassan being well furnish'd with Wood and Pastures, was
also well supply'd with fowl.
               The 2. The wind being somewhat lay'd, we weigh'd Anchor, for the prosecution of our
Voyage: but ere we had gotten a quarter of a League, we met again with Sand-banks near the
Isle of Tletinski, and soon after others, near the Isle of Subsinski, where we saw a great Boat
which had not long before been cast away thereabouts. These unfortunate accidents, our being
nine hours getting off this last Bank, together with the ignorance of our Pilot, who acknowledg'd
he had not made that Voyage in eight years before, much abated their courage, who,
considering that in four days they had made but two Leagues, and that there were 550. to make,
ere they came to the Caspian Sea, began to doubt they should never go through that Voyage.
               But the 3d. We advanc'd a little better, and pass'd by the Villages of Stolbiza and Stoba,
which lye three leagues from Nise. We saw afterwards, on the right hand, in a bottom between
two Mountains, the Village of Welikofrat, that of Tsimonski, upon a Hill, and the Isle
of Diploi at twenty Werstes, or four leagues from Nise. Near this Village we met with a great
Vessel that had 200 men in it. It came from Astrachan, and was loaden with salt fish. They
cannot be without such a great number of Mariners, by reason that, instead of Laveering or
Rowing, when the wind is against them, they cast Anchor a quarter of a League before them,
and all those men pull the Cable to which it is fasten'd, and so they advance by little and little,
with much expence of time and pains, making but two Leagues a day at most, by reason of the
greatness of those Boats, which are of 800. 900. or 1000. Tuns burthen. In the afternoon we
left several Villages on the right hand, as Beswodna, Kasnitza, where I found the elevation to
be 56d. 21 m. Rubotka, Tzetschina, Targinits, and Iurkin, where we pass'd between two
Islands at 21 foot water. This last Village is ten Leagues from Nise. At night, the wind being
more fair for us, we made use of our Sayls. The next day, the wind still good, we pass'd by
several little Villages, leaving on the right hand the Towns of Masa and Cremonski, near which
we lay at Anchor, the fourth all night, because, the River being shallow thereabouts, we avoided
running upon the Sand-banks in the dark.
               The 5th. Betimes in the morning,Bsiligrod. we got before a little Village, called Pannino, whence
the Peasants brought us Pullets and other Provisions to sell, very cheap. Then we pass'd between
two Isles, one called Spassabelka, and at night we came in sight of the City of Basiligorod,
where we stay'd that night, by reason of the Sands. There we receiv'd by a Messenger, who
had been sent express from Moscou, Letters from Germany, dated in May. The City of Basiligorod
is not Wall'd, and its Houses, even the publick edifices being but of Wood, we may
say, it is properly but a Village. It is situated at the foot of a Mountain, upon the right shore
of the River Wolga, at 55 degrees and 51 m. elevation, at the falling in of the little River Sura,
which was heretofore a comn Frontier between the Tartars of Casan and the Muscovites.
The Creat Duke Basili buil, to prevent the incursions of Tartars, and fortify'd it; but now
that the Muscovites have extended their Territories much farther, they think it unnecessary to
keep any Garrison there.
               The 6th. We had much ado to pass the Sands, which we met with every foot, so that it
was afternoon ere we came up to the City, which we saluted with a volley of our great Guns.
That honour we did all the Cities upon the same River.
               The Tartars we spoke of are called Ceremisses,Ceremises. and their Country reaches beyond Casan, on
both sides of the River Wolga. They have no Houses, but only wretched Huts, and live upon
Honey, and the wild-fowl they take in the Woods, and Milk, which their Pastures furnish
them with. 'Tis a Nation absolutely barbarous, treacherous, and cruel, much given to sorcery
and robbery. Those who live on the right side of the Wolga are called Nagorni, or Mountaineers,
from the word na, which, in the Muscovian Language, signifies, upon, and Gor, a
Mountain: and those on the left Lugoivi or Lugowizene, that is to say, Meadows, because of
the abundance of Hay which those parts afford, insomuch that the Nagorni are supply'd thence.
Guagnin says, they are partly Mahumetans, partly Heathens; but this I am certain of, that
about Casan they are all Heathens; not knowing what either Circumcision or Baptism means.
All the Ceremony they have when they are to give a Child a name, consists in appointing
some day six moneths after, on which they give it the name of that person whom they
first meet.
               Most of them believe there is a God, who is immortal, author of all the good that happens
to men, and that he ought to be adored. But this is all they know of him; For they do not
believe the immortality of the Soul, nor consequently the Resurrection of the dead: but that
men and beasts have the same beginning, and come to the same end. I met with one of the Ceremisses
at a house where I lodg'd at Casan. He was aged about 45 years, and wanted not ingenuity,
but understanding that I was discoursing with my Host about some points of
Religion, and that I spoke of the Resurrection of the Dead, he laugh'd at the perswasion,

and said to me, Those who are dead are really dead, and will never return again, no more than
my Horses and Cows, which are long since rotten. I asked him whether he knew who Created
this World, and made Heaven and Earth? his answer was, Tzortsneit, The Devil may haply
know. They do not believe there is any Hell, yet are perswaded there are Devils, and evil
Spirits, which afflict and torment people in this life; and therefore they endeavour to appease
them, and to gain their favour by Sacrifices.
               Forty Leagues from Casan there is a place called Nemda, amidst the Fenns, where these
Tartars go Pilgrimages and do their Devotions; and they believe that those who go thither
empty-handed, and carry no Present to the Devil, shall languish and pine away of some long
and incurable disease. A particular point of their faith, is, that the Devil hath his principal residence
in the Torrent of Schockschem, ten Werstes from Nunda; and whereas that little rivulet,
which is but four foot deep, is never frozen (occasion'd by the violence of its course
between two Mountains) they think it is not without some mystery, and they have so great a
veneration for it, as to be perswaded, they cannot come near it, without danger of their lives,
though the Muscovites cross it dayly without any.
               In their Sacrifices to God, they kill a Horse, an Ox, or a Sheep, roasting the flesh, and take
a cut thereof in a Dish, and holding in the other hand another Dish full of Hydromel, or some
other liquor, they cast both into a fire, which they make before the skin of the Creature that
is sacrificed, which skin they hang upon a Pole laid a-cross between two Trees. They intreat
that skin to present their Prayers to God, or sometimes they make their address immediately to
God, and pray him to augment the number of their Cattel, or grant them some other conveniencies
of this life, which are the only object of all their Devotions. They adore also the Sun
and Moon, as Authors of all the Noble Productions of the Earth; nay they are so fondly superstitious,
as to have a veneration for what ever presents it self to them in the night in their
Dreams, and to adore it the next day, as a Horse, a Cow, Fire, Water, &c. I told the Tartar
I spoke of before, that it was madness, to worship those Creatures, whose lives are at our
disposal; He reply'd, that it was better to adore things Animate, than the Gods of Wood and
Colours which the Muscovites have hanging on their Walls. They have neither Churches,
nor Priests, nor Books, and the Language of the Ceremisses is peculiar to them, having in a manner
nothing common with that of the other Tartars, nor yet with the Turkish; though those
who are subject to the Czaar, and so oblig'd to converse with the Muscovites, make use also of
their Language.
               They perform all Religious Ceremonies and Sacrifices near some Torrent, where they meet
together, especially when upon the death of any of their friends, who hath left any Wealth
behind him, they make good Cheer with the best Horse he had, which they put to death with
the Master.
               Polygamy is so ordinary among them, that there are few but have four or five Wives, whereof
they take two or three into the same house, and make no great difficulty to marry two or
three Sisters at the same time. Their Women and young Maids are all clad in a coarse white
Cloath, wherein they so wrap up themselves, that there is nothing to be seen but their Faces.
Those that are betroathed have a particular dress for their Heads, which hath a point like a
Horn, which seems to come out of the Head, about half an ell in length: At the end of that
Horn, there is a Tassel of silk, of diverse colours, at which hangs a little Bell. The Men wear
a long Coat or Garment of coarse Linnen Cloath, under which they wear Breeches. They all
shave their Heads, only those young Men that are not married, leave on the Head a long tress of
Hair, which some tye up into a knot upon the Head, others suffer to hang down the Back:
which particularity we had the opportunity to take better notice of at our return at Casan.
When they saw us upon the River in a Dress so different from theirs, they were affrighted, so
as that some fled, others had the confidence to stay on the Rivers side, but not one would venture
to come into the Ship. Being come at night to the River of Welluka, near the Monastery
of Iunka, one of these Tartars had the courage to bring us a Sturgeon to sell, for which, at first,
he asked a Crown, but afterwards let it go for xv d.
               August 7. we came before the City of Kusmademiansky, 40. werstes from Basiligorod, seated
at the foot of a mountain on the right hand. We saw, in those parts, whole Forests of
Elms, the Bark whereof they sell all over the Country to make Sledges of. The Trees are many
times of such compass, that the body of them being cut cylinder-wise, they make great Fats,
Barrels, and Coffins thereof, all of one piece, which they sell at the adjacent Towns.
               We cast Anchor three werstes thence near the Island of Krius, where we did our Devotions,
and Celebrated the Lords Supper. The Peasants thereabouts, brought aboard the Ship several
provisions to sell. About a league thence a tempest overtook us, and forc'd us to cast Anchor
and to stay there all night.
               The 8. the wind fair, we got, about noon, near the Island of Turich; but in the afternoon,
the same wind forc'd our Ship, being under all the Sail she could make, upon a Sand-bank, near
the Island of Maslof, with such violence, that it was thought the Masts would have broken;

and this prov'd such a check to us, that it cost us four hours toil and trouble to get off. We
perceiv'd on the right hand a great number of Tartars, some a-foot, some on horse-back, coming
from Hay-making. We came at night before the City of Sabakzar, 40. werstes from Kusmademianski,The City of Sabakzar.
and upon the same side of the River. The buildings of this City are of Wood, as
are those of all the rest, but the situation of this is, beyond comparison, more pleasant than
that of any other City of Tartary. The Inhabitants perceiving our Ship at some distance, knew
not at first what to think of her; whence it came that the Weywode sent some Musketiers in a
Boat, as far as the Island of Makrits, three werstes from the City, to discover what we were.
The Boat thinking it not safe to venture too near us, took a compass, at a great distance about
our Ship, and so returned to the City. But they no sooner understood our quality by our Pass-port,
and withall the occasion of our Voyage, but there came above 300. persons to the River side to
see us pass by.
               The 9. we pass'd by the Island of Cosin, leaving it on the left hand, 12. werstes from Sabakzar.
Afterwards on the same hand a Village, named Sundir, and thence we came to a little City
called Kockschaga, on the left side of the Wolga, 25. werstes from Sabakzar. The River is so
shallow thereabouts, that there was hardly water enough for our Ship, which put us to much
trouble, both that day and the next.
               The 11. the current having forc'd the Ship upon the shore, where we were constrain'd to stay
for several hours, M. Mandelslo and my self went a shore, to divert our selves and see what
Fruits we could find in the Woods. Which had like to have occasion'd us a great misfortune,
for the wind turning fair, at our return to the River side, all were gone, the Ship it self not in
sight, though we made all the hast we could to overtake it. At last we saw a Boat coming towards
us, which we thought at first might belong to the Cosaques; but soon after we perceiv'd
they were some of our own, sent to bring us aboard. The conrtary wind had stay'd the Ship at
a turning of the River, and the tempest still increasing, we were forc'd to cast anchor, and to lie
there all night.
               The 12. we spent in getting beyond the turning by the help of an Anchor which we order'd
to be cast at some distance before us, but with this misfortune, that having fasten'd in a Tree
that was in the bottom, the Cable broke ere it could be had up again. The River is very full of
those Trees, which it brings down with it when it overflows; and these accidents happen so
frequently, that the bottom of the River is so lay'd with Anchors, that the Muscovites say,
there are as many as would purchase a Kingdom.
               The 13. before noon, we saw, as we pass'd, two Cabaques, or Taverns, and a Village named
Wesoska,The City of Suiatski. on the right hand, and came afterwards before the City of Suiatski. It is seated
on the ascent of a hill, on the left hand, having a Castle and some Churches built of stone: but
all the other buildings, as also the Towers and Rampiers of the City, are of wood. We cast
Anchor there, by reason of a Sand-bank which we were to pass by. The people in the mean
time came in multitudes to the River side to see us, and by reason that a little sandy Hill hindred
their having a full sight of us, many came in Boats to the Ship side, others swam over to the
Hill. Having pass'd by certain white Mountains, whereof some were of Chalk, others of Sand,
we came at night before the City of Casan,The City of Casan. 20. werstes from Suiatski. We there found the Caravan
of Persia and Circassia, and with it a Coptzi or Persian Merchant, who had been sent
Ambassador to Moscou.A Tartar Prince. There was in this place also a Tartarian Prince, of Terki, whose
name was Mussal, who had succeeded his Brother in the Principality, and had then been doing
homage to the Czaar, at Moscou, which he had left some dayes before us.
               The City of Casan is seated in a plain, 7. werstes from the Wolga, upon the River Casanka,
which gives it the name, as it does to the whole Province. I found the elevation there to be 55.
degrees, 38. minutes. It is of a considerable bigness, but all its Houses, as also the Towers and
Rampiers, are of wood. Only the Castle and its Fortifications are of stone, being well mounted
with Canon, and having a strong Garrison in it. The River is instead of a Ditch to it, and
makes it a very considerable fortress. The Castle hath its VVeywode, and the City, its Governour,
who commands and administers Justice to the Inhabitants, who are Muscovites and Tartars:
But in the Castle they are all Muscovites, and the Tartars are prohibited entring into it
upon pain of death.
               The Province of Casan lies on the left side of the River of VVolga,The Province of Casan. reaching Northwards as
far as Siberia, and Eastward, as far as the Tartars of Nagaja. It was heretofore subject to the
Cham of Tartary, and so populous, that it could send 60000, men into the Field. The conquest
of it cost the Muscovite much blood, and the story of its reduction is so remarkable, that
I think fit here to make a short digression to give an accompt thereof.
               Basili Iuanouits,Reduc'd by the Muscovites. Father to the Tyrant Iuan Basilouits, having obtain'd a famous Victory over
these Tartars, made Chief over them one named Scheale, a Tartar by birth, but one so ill
shap'd as to his Person, that his Subjects, who soon conceiv'd an aversion for him, joyning with
the Tartars, of Chrim, who are Mahumetans, as they also are, made an insurrection, surpriz'd
him, and ejected him. This success gave the Chrim-Tartars, who had got a considerable

Army together, the courage to enter Muscovy, under the conduct of two Brethren, Mendligeri,
and Sapgeri, who forc'd the Muscovite, with certain Troops which he had made a shift to get
together, and were encamped upon the River Occa, to retreat to Novogorod.
               The consequence of this was the besieging,The Tartars Masters of the City of Moscou. taking and plundring of the City of Moscou;
nay they reduc'd the Castle to that extremity, that the Muscovites were forc'd to sue for a
Peace. The Tartars were willing to hearken to an accommodation, and having got very considerable
Presents from those who kept the Castle, who maintain'd it with more courage than
success, they made a Peace, whereof this was one Article, That the Great Duke and all his
Subjects, should ever after be Tributaries to them. Basili was loath to submit to such dishonourable
Terms, but forc'd to comply with necessity, he accepted them, and confirmed the
agreement by his Letters Patents.
               Mendligeri,The Great Duke Tributary to the artar. to make it appear he was Sovereign Lord of Moscou, caused a Statue of his to
be erected in the heart of the City, and would needs oblige the Great Duke, to express his
subjection, to smite the ground with his head, before that Statue, as often as he paid Tribute
to the Tartars. After this Victory the Brethren parted; Sapgeri establish'd the Seat of his Government
at Casan and Mendligeri, as being the Elder-Brother, his, at the City of Chrim. But
the later desirous to add to his former conquest that of the City of Resan, resolv'd to lay siege
to the Castle thereof, and to that end, he sent word to the Weywode, Iohn Kowar, who commanded
it, that it was madness in him to think to maintain the place, and that he should make
no difficulty to deliver it up,The fidelity of the Weywode of Resan. since the Great Duke was become his Subject. The Weywode sent
him answer, that it was a thing so extraordinary, that he could not believe it, unless he sent
him such assurances thereof, as should put him out of all doubt. Mendligeri imagining there
could not any thing be more convictive in that case than the Letters Patents, sent them to him
by certain Officers, just as he had receiv'd them from the Great Duke. But the Weywode, not
a little glad to have the Original of those Letters in his hands, sends Mendligeri word, that
he would keep them as safely as he would do the place he was in, which he resolv'd to maintain
to the last drop of blood. There was in the Castle an Italian Canoneer named Iohn Iordan,
well known in those parts upon the accompt of his Wife, who would needs have her Husband
express his affection to her by beating her with a Bull's pizzle. This man did the Weywode very
great services, and kill'd so many Tartars, that Mendligeri perceiving one day, that a Canon-bullet
had taken off a piece of his Garment, was frighted, and proffered to raise the Siege,
upon condition they would return the Great Duke's Letters. But the Weywode would hearken
to no such thing, and having oblig'd Mendligeri to retreat, he sent the Letters to his Prince's
Court, where they were received with the general joy of all the people, who immediately
thereupon pull'd down, and broke to pieces the Statue of Mendliger. Nay the Great Duke
himself took such courage from that Action, that having rais'd an Army of 25000 men, he
proclaim'd open War against Sapgeri, Prince of Casan, sending him word, that he, by surprising
and assaulting him without declaring any War, had proceeded like a Murtherer and a Robber;
but that himself, as Soveraign Lord and Conservator of all the Russes, proceeded therein
as a person of Honour should do, and sent him word, that his Army was upon the march, in
order to the besieging of Casan. This Siege caus'd the loss of much blood on both sides, but
prov'd unfortunate to the Muscovites, who were at last forc'd to raise it. Thus ended the War
between the Great Duke Basili Iuanouits and the Tartars.
               His Son,Casan esieged by John Basilouits. Iohn Basilouits, to shew the World how much he resented the affront, which the
Muscovites had receiv'd before Casan, began his Reign with the Siege of that place. Having
batter'd it for the space of two moneths together, fearing that Mendligeri would come in with
his Crim-Tartars to the relief of his Brother, and exasperated at the refusal which the besieged had
made, to accept of very honourable conditions, he commanded all the Walls to be undermined,
and a general assault to be given.And takes it by storm. The Mines wrought their effect, and took off great numbers
of the Tartars, the Assault was given, and the place carry'd by storm, on the 9 of Iuly 1552.
The Tartars perceiving the enemies were gotten into the place, took this resolution after they
had made a vigorous resistance in two several places within the City, where they fortify'd themselves,
and seeing their chiefest Commanders kill'd or wounded, they went out at one of the
Gates, made their way through the Muscovites, and got on the other side of the River Casanska
Ever since, the City and Province of Casan hath continued under the Muscovite, who
repair'd the breaches, renew'd the Fortifications, and reduc'd the Castle to the condition it is
now in, having four Bastions, of stone, many Towers, and a good Ditch.
               He who had the command of this place, when we pass'd that way, was Brother to the Weywode
of Nise The Ambassadors sent him, as a Present, by their Chamberlain, M. Vchterits,
a very Noble Ruby. M. Mandelslo and I, conceiving our Ship would have lain there at Anchor
all that day and the next,Melons of extraordinary bigness. went ashore, as well to take the situation of the City, as to
buy certain provisions. We could meet with nothing but Fruits, among others, particularly
Melons, full as big as our Pompions, and Salt-fish, but such as stunk so that we were forc'd
to stop our Noses, to shun the infection. As we came out of the City, we met with divers

Tartars, who told us that our Ship was gone; which intelligence oblig'd us to take a
VVagon, and afterwards, to make use of the Pristaf's Boat to bring us aboard, which,
in the evening we found at Anchor, two leagues below Casan, where they intended to lye all
that night.
               The course of the River Wolga from Nisenovogorod to Casan,The Course of Wolga. is East-ward, and South-East-ward;
but from Casan to Astrachan, and the Caspian Sea, it goes from North to South. The
Country is very good, and fertile, but in a manner desolate, by reason of the Cosques, and
hath but few Villages.
               Aug. 15. We continu'd our course, with the current of the water, which being very strong
in that place by reason of the narrowness of the River, brought us that day as far as the Village
of Klitsischa, 26. werstes from Casan, lying amidst several Sand-banks, which we had
much ado to pass through. Some part of that day, as also of the next, we spent in recovering
our Anchors, whereof the Cables were broken; we at last made a shift to get up the great one,
and left the little one behind, as being loath to lose any more time. Thence, we pass'd by a
Tavern called Kabak Tenkofski, 30. werstes from Casan, where we met with great Sand-banks;
and about half a League beyond it, another Bank, near a Tavern called Keshofska, which we
had much difficulty to pass.
               The 17. We pass'd over a great Bank, which had given the name to the Tavern we had
pass'd by the day before. Thence we came to a place, where the shore on one side was very
high, and some part of it fallen into the River about a moneth before, and by its fall had overwhelm'd
a Boat full of people, who were going that way to gather Cherries, whereof there is
abundance in those parts. The new Pilot, whom we had taken up at Casan, told us, that coming
from Astrachan,Ice in August. he had met several of those Carkasses floating down the River, towards
the Caspian Sea. Hereabouts, near the shore, on the right hand, we met with great quantities
of Ice, which we put into our drinks, to make them drink the cooler.
               In the evening we came to a place where the great River of Kama falls into the Wolga.The River Kama. It
comes from North-East, out of the Province of Permie, and falls into the Wolga, on our left
hand, 60. werstes from Casan. The water of it is blackish, and it is much about the same breadth
as that of Weser in Germany. At the mouth of it there are two Islands, whereof the greater is
called Sokol; and upon the Continent, over against it, a handsom Village called Pagantzina, and
three werstes thence, another, named Corotai, whence we got seven werstes further, as far as a
Village named Kirieska, where we stay'd all night.
               The 18. The wind was so fair for us, that we made all the Sail we could, and got, by noon,
to the place where the River Zerdick falls into the Wolga, which is also on the left hand. It is
indeed but a branch of the River Kama, making a kind of an Island, and having another mouth
thirty werstes from the former. We discover'd at the same time on our right hand, upon a little
ascent,The City of Tetus. the City of Tetus, distant from Casan 120. werstes, having its buildings, as well publick
as private, disorderly scatter'd up and down. From this place to the Caspian Sea, there is no
Village at all.
               In the afternoon, near an Island called Proleikarsa, we met with the Weywode of Terki. This
City is seated upon the Caspian Sea near Astrachan, and the Weywode, upon the expiration of
his three years Government, was then returning to Moscou, to make way for his Successor.
He was very well attended, having a Convoy of eight Boats with Musketiers in them. At first,
we knew not who they were, so that we kept them at a distance, by threatning to fire at them
if they came nearer. They told us there were three thousand Cosaques, who expected us at the
passage, some upon the River, some on the Caspian Sea; that they had seen not far thence,
upon the River-side, 70. horse, which the Tartars had drawn off to make a discovery of us, and
that they would be sure to set upon us; thinking with these stories to frighten us. We gave
them one great shot, and kept on our course, having the wind so fair, as that it carried us 70.
werstes that day.The River of Utka. In the mean time, we left on our left hand the River Vtka, which rises near
the City of Bulgara, 25. werstes from Tetus. We thought fit, the night following, to make
tryal what our people could do, in case we should be set upon, so that the Ambassadors conceived
it would not be amiss to have a false Alarum given, ordering the Sentinels to cry out,
and to discharge, and thereupon the Drums to beat, and the Musket and great Guns to be shot
off. Our men did their parts very well, and kept their stations, expressing much resolution.
We did the like in our return from Persia.
               The 19. VVe came to the Island of Staritzo, which is 15. werstes long. There I found the
Elevation to be 54. d. 31. m. Behind that Island, on the right hand, we found a great number
of round stones, much after the form of Orenges or Citrons, which, being broken in the midst,
represented a Star of divers colours, whereof some had the resemblance of polish'd Gold or Silver,
others where brown or yellow. VVe took up a good quantity of them, to serve us for
bullets for our Murthering-Pieces. Thence we came to a very pleasant place, where might have
been seen heretofore a City of Tartary, called Vneroskora. There, had been buried one of their
Saints, for which Monument those that live thereabouts have still a great Devotion. From this

place to the City of Tetus are accompted 65 werstes. We saw on the River-side, under certain
Trees, two men on hors-back, who immediately got out of the way, which occasion'd us to
send one to stand Sentinel in the Scuttle of the main Mast; but they appear'd no
more.
               The 20. There came several Fisher-men of Tetus aboard us, and brought us 55 large breams,
which they had taken thereabouts, and sold them us for fifty pence. They have a particular
way of fishing. They fasten to the end of a long cord, a pretty big stone, which falls to the
bottom, and at the other end of the said cord several great pieces of Wood which swim upon
the water. All along this cord are fasten'd many little cords, each whereof hath a hook baited
with a certain kind of fish which is not of the least, but such as the others greedily feed upon.
The fish they take by this invention is ten or twelve foot long, the meat of it white, firm, and
very delicate. In our return from Persia, there was one brought to the Boat where I was with
the Ambassador Crusius, which was so big, though there was nothing else eaten, by reason every
one liked it so well, yet was all the company satisfied, and there was as much left as fill'd
a barrel, wherein it was pickled up.
               When the Muscovites travel about their own occasions, they make use of another invention.
They fasten a hook to the end of a Cord, and tye the Cord about a piece of board of about the
breadth of a man's hand, plain'd very smooth, and tinn'd over; and drag it after the Boat, so
as that the current of the water causing it ever and anon to turn up towards the Sun, makes it
shine like the scales of fish: by which means drawing the greater sort of fish after it, they take
more than they can spend while they are on the water. So that the Muscovites, making no other
provision, for their journeys, but of bread twice bak'd or dried in the Oven, find it no hard
matter to subsist any where; not to mention, that their continual abstinences, and their Fasts
having accustom'd them to be content with little, and to care little for flesh, they make a shift
to live upon any thing they can meet withall; nay, in case of necessity, upon the liquor which
Nature furnishes them with.
               At this place we let go the Boat which had carried our Provisions from Nise, which being
empty we had no further use for: but we thought fit to set it a fire, lest it might have fallen into
the hands of the Cosaques, who would have made use of it against us. About noon, we pass'd
by the Island of Botenska, which is three werstes in length, and is only divided by a small Chanel,
from a kind of Cape, or Promontory, called Polibno. The contrary wind forc'd us to Anchor
behind the Island, near the River Beitma, which, as they say, is also a branch of the great
River Kama.
               The 21. We left, on the right hand, two very pleasant places, which are reported
to have been heretofore great Cities, destroy'd by Tamberlane, whereof one was called Simberska-gora.
               The 22. With some little difficulty, we pass'd over three Sand Banks, whereof one is above,
the other, below the place whence may be seen the Mountain Arbeuchin, which was on our
right hand. It derives its name from a City, whereof the ruines are yet to be seen.
               There may be seen from the River a great stone about 20 foot in length, and as many in
breadth, lying between two little Hills, having engraven on it the words following, Budesch
time dobro toboe budet; that is to say, If thou raise me, thou shalt be well rewarded. We were told,
that not long before, a great Muscovian Boat being forc'd by contrary winds to make some
stay there, fifty Passengers went ashore, to raise the stone; but when they had with much ado
turned it, they only found engraven on the other side these words, Tsto isches netsebo poloschen;
that is to say, In vain dost thou look for what thou hadst not put there. On the right hand, we had
the view of a spacious and very delightful Champain Country, the ground very rich, with a
high grass on it; but it was not inhabited, and there could be seen only the ruins of Cities and
Villages, which had been heretofore destroy'd by Tamberlane.
               The 23. The contrary wind forc'd us to Anchor near the River Adrobe, where I found the
Elevation to be 53 degr. 48 minutes. In the afternoon, we thought to advance a little by laveering,
but we hardly got half a league further.
               The 24. The contrary wind, still continuing at the same height, forc'd us twice against the
shore, and very much hindred the prosecution of our Voyage. For some dayes following we
had the same incovenience, by reason of the Sand-banks, and the inconstancy of the wind,
which rise about nine in the morning; and about five at night there was not the least breath stirring,
by that means adding to the affliction which otherwise lay heavy enough on us. For, besides
that the indisposition of most of our people made that undelightful voyage the more tedious
to them, continual watching, and the insupportable trouble we were every foot put to, reduc'd
them to a very sad condition. Those who had been in action all night, though it was not
their profession to bear Arms, were, in the day time, forc'd to row. Smoak'd and Salt-meats afforded
little nourishment, and the discontents arising otherwise upon the frowardness of one of
the Ambassadors, in a manner took away the little courage we had left to encounter with the
great inconveniences of that long voyage.
               
                  
The 25. We saw on the right hand, a Mountain out of which the Muscovites get Salt, which
they prepare in certain Huts, built for that purpose at the foot of the Mountain, then expose it
to the Sun, and send it along the Wolga for Moscou. Opposite to this Mountain is the Island of
Kostowata. The River hereabouts is very broad, by reason of the lowness of the shores on both
sides.The River Ussa. Not far hence there is another Mountain, at the foot whereof is the River Vssa, which
though it there falls into the Wolga, yet is united again to it, sixty werstes below Samara. There
are on both sides of the River pleasant Pastures; but not far thence there being thick VVoods
with a high Mountain adjoyning, whence Robbers discover at a great distance what Passengers
there are coming, it is very dangerous travelling that way. The Cosaques make their advantages
thereof, and not a year before our passage that way, they took a great Vessel loaden, belonging
to one of the richest Merchants of Nise. Near this River we had sixty foot water, as also near
the Mountain Diwisagora, which word signifies, the Maids Mountain, and the Muscovites say
it derives its name from certain Maids that had sometime been kept there by a Shee-Dwarf. VVe
left it on the right hand. It is very high and steepy towards the River, whence it may be seen
divided into several Hills, pleasant to the eye by reason of the diversity of the colours, some being
red, some blew, some yellow, &c. and representing, at a great distance, the ruins of some
great and magnificent structure. Upon every Hill or Bank is a row of Pine-Trees, so regularly
planted, that a man might doubt whether it were not Artificial, were it not that the Mountain
is inaccessible of all sides. At the foot of this Mountain there rises another, which reaches along
the River, for eight Leagues together. The Valley between those two Mountains, is called
Iabla-new-quas, that is to say, Apple-drink, from the great number of Apple-Trees there,
which bear Apples fit only for Cider.
               The same day we receiv'd Letters from Moscou by an express Messenger, who brought us also
Letters from Nise, by which we understood, that among our Mariners, there were four Cosaques,
who came into our retinue, purposely to betray us into the hands of their Camerades.
This notice, though we were carefull enough to look after our people before, added to our care,
and made us more vigilant.
               In the evening, after Sun-set, we perceiv'd two great fires at the entrance of a VVood on the
right hand, which putting us into a fear they might be the Cosaques who lay in wait for us,
there were five or six Musketiers sent to discover what they where: but ours having shot off
three Muskets, the other answer'd them with the like number, and discover'd themselves to be
Strelits, who had been ordered to Guard a Persian Caravan, and were then returning to their
Garrisons. The Ambassador Brugman, impatient to hear what accompt our men would bring,
and thinking they stay'd very long, call'd after them as loud as he could, but the contrary wind
hindred them from hearing him; and in that suspence he would have had some of the great Guns
discharg'd at those fires; but the Ambassador Crusius oppos'd it, and told him, that their quality
obliging them to stand onely upon the defensive part, he would not by any means consent
thereto.
               In the night, between the 26. and 27. our Sentinels perceiv'd in a little Boat, two men, who,
thinking to go along by our ship-side, were stay'd, and forc'd to come aboard us. They said
they were fisher-men, and that the Muscovites, whom they called their brethren, suffered them
to go along with their Boats by night as well as by day: but, in regard we were told, the Cosaques
took this course, and were wont to come near Vessels, to cut their Cables, we examin'd
them apart, and finding their answers different, one saying there were 500. Cosaques waiting for
us, in an Isle near Soratof, the other denying it, they were kept all night, and the next morning
we sent them by our Pristaf to the Weywode of Samara.
               The 27. We saw, on the left hand, in a spacious plain, not far from the River side, a Hill of
Sand like a Down. The Muscovites call it Sariol Kurgan, and affirm, that a certain Tartarian
Emperour, named Momaon, who had a design to enter Muscovy, together with seven Kings
of the same Nation, dy'd in that place, and that his Soldiers, instead of burying him, fill'd
their Head-pieces and Bucklers with Sand, and so cover'd the body that it became a Mountain.
               About a League from the said Hill, and on the same side, begins the Mountain of Soccobei,
which reaches along the River-side, as far as Samara, which is distant from that place 15.
werstes. It is very high, in a manner all Rock, cover'd with Trees, unless it be on the top,
where it is all bare. The Muscovites take much notice of this place, because it is very dangerous
passing thereabouts. We came near it about noon, but the contrary wind oblig'd us to cast
Anchor.The superstition of the Muscovites. While we stay'd there we saw coming from the shore two great red Snakes, which
got by the Cables into the ship. As soon as the Muscovites perceiv'd them, they intreated us
not to kill them, but to give them somewhat to eat, as being a sort of innocent beasts, sent by
St. Nicholas, to bring us a fair wind, and to comfort us in our affliction.
               The 28.The City of Samara. We weigh'd betimes in the morning, and came before day near the City of Samara,
which is 350. werstes from Casan. It lies on the left hand, two werstes from the River side. It
is, as to form, almost square, all its buildings of VVood, unless it be some Churches, and two

or three Monasteries. The River of Samar, where it hath the name, by a little Bank, which
is called Sin-Samar, falls into the Wolga, three werstes below the City, but is not absolutely
united thereto till after 30 werstes lower.
               We intended to make some stay near the City, in expectation to hear, by our Pristaf, what
our Prisoners had depos'd; but the wind came so fair for us, that we thought better not to let
slip the opportunity we then had to make the greatest days journey of any since the beginning of
our Voyage.The Mountain of the Cosaques. Accordingly, we got at night, to the Mountain of the Cosaques, which is 115.
werstes from Samara, and so the prognostication of the Muscovian Mariners, by the Snakes,
proved true. From the City of Samara, to the place where the river Samar falls into the Wolga,
there is all along one continued mountain. Near the same place, but on the other side of the River,
the River Ascula falls into it, so that the falling in of all these waters together, does so swell
the Wolga, that in this place it is near two leagues broad. Afterwards, on the right hand may
be seen the mountain called Pestcherski, which is in a manner all one Rock, having very little
upon it, and reaching near 40 werstes along the river side.
               About 100 werstes from Samara, in the midst of the river, is the Island of Batrach, and ten
werstes lower that of Lopatin, which is five werstes in length, and lies opposite to the river Lisran,
which there falls into the Wolga, on the right hand. Afterwards, we pass'd by many little
Isles, and came very late at night to the mountain of the Cosaques. It is all bare and without
wood. The Cosaques who live upon the River Don, and had their retreating places in this
mountain, whence they at a great distance discovered the Boats that were coming down, and
there appointed parties to carry on their Robberies, have given it the name. But ever since the
Weywode of Samara surpriz'd there a great party of Cosaques, whereof there were five or six
hundred kill'd upon the place, they have forborn assembling there in so great numbers, and appear
only in small parties. All these mountains do sometimes reach a great way into the Country,
and sometimes they do but in a manner border the river, to which they serve instead of a
bank. We lay at Anchor all night, at the place where this mountain begins, and the next
day, 29. we pass'd it, and, in our way, the river Pantzina, which falls into the Wolga, on the
right hand, and having sail'd that day 45 werstes, we cast Anchor at night near the Isle of Sagerinsko,
where we staid all night. Some Fisher-men, who came aboard, gave us intelligence
that they had seen thereabouts 40 Cosaques, who had made their appearance on the river side.
Here we told our people, that our Beer beginning to grow low, they must content themselves
for the future with water, into which they might put a little Vinegar, and so make Oxicrat
of it.
               Aug. 30. we came betimes in the morning to the mouth of the river Zagra, which falls into
the Wolga on the right hand, near the Isle of Zagerinsko, to which it gives the name. Forty
werstes thence, we pass'd by the Isle of Sosnou, where news was brought us, that we should
meet with the 500 Casaques, of whom one of the Fisher-men of Samara had given us an
alarm; whereupon all took Arms, and the Guns were made ready, but we saw not
any body.
               Towards noon, we came over against the mountain of Tichy, which comes out so far on the
right hand, that at a great distance, it seems to dam up the river, which nevertheless is so shallow
thereabouts, that some affirmed, the Cosaques forded it. Not far off there is a Bank of
Sand, called Owetzabrot, and several little Isles; full of copses and bushes, which the Cosaques
know how to make their advantages of, in the carrying on their enterprises. There we
met with two Fishermen, who told us, that some eight days before, the Cosaques had taken
a great Boat from them, and had told them that within a small time, they expected to come
into those parts a great German ship. In the evening, we called to two other Fisher-men, who
coming aboard, we asked them what they knew concerning the Cosaques. The more aged was
at first cautious and would say nothing, but perceiving, the other, who was much younger,
had not used the same reserv'dness, he confirm'd what his Camerade had said, and assur'd us,
that he had seen 40 Cosaques retreating into the Wood, which we discover'd from our Ship, and
that they had six Boats, which they had brought ashore, to be made use of against us. They
both intreated us, to make our best advantage, of that discovery, which would cost them their
lives, if the Cosaques came to know as much, and to carry them away as Prisoners, and set
them ashore some werstes thence. Which we accordingly did, but we doubled our Guards,
and kept them under a Guard all that night, in regard we had no reason to be more confident
of them, than of the Cosaques themselves. The next morning at the Break of day, we dismiss'd
them. That day we sailed 60 werstes.
               The last of August, we had so good a wind that we got 120. werstes between Sun and Sun.
The Isle of Ossino, ten werstes distant from Saratof, was the first thing we saw that day. The
Sand-bank which near that place reaches a great way into the River, put us to some difficulty
to pass it. The Ship struck several times against it, yet at last pass'd it without any stop.
Twenty werstes thence there is another Isle called Schismamago, and then that of Koltof, which
is 50 werstes from Soratof, where we found sometimes 16. sometimes 20. sometimes 30. sometimes

40. foot water. Between these two Isles we met with two great Boats, having each of them
400. Mariners aboard it, one belong'd to the Patriarch, and was loaden with Provisions; the other,
which was loaden with Cavyar, which is a past of the Spawn of Eggs of Sturgeon salted, as we
have said elsewhere, belong'd to the Great Duke. They gave us several Volleys of small shot, and
we answer'd their civility with a great Gun. Near the Isle of Koltof, we met with four other Boats,
coming from Astrachan, loaden with Salt and Salt-fish, upon the accompt of Gregori Mikitof,
one of the richest Merchants of Moscou. The Boat-men told us that they had seen, near
Astrachan, in several Boats, about 200. Cosaques, who had suffer'd them to pass, without
saying any thing to them. Not far from this Ie may be seen on the right hand, the mountain
of Smiowa, which is above 40. westes in length. The word Smiowa signifies a Serpent, and
they have given the Mountain that name, because it sometimes winds it self a great way into
the Country, sometimes, it only borders the River. The Muscovites would have it so called
from a Serpent, or Dragon, which having done abundance of mischief thereabouts, was kill'd
by some great Heroe, and cut into three pieces, which were immediately metamorphosed into
so many stones, and are shewn to this day, to such as pass that way. From this Mountain, all
along the plain may be seen many Isles, which they call Sarok ostrowe, that is to say, the Forty
Isles.
               Sept. 1. betimes in the morning,SEPTEMBER. we met with three great Boats, between 5. and 600. tun a
piece, which yet took up but 12. foot of water. They tow'd after them a great many little
Boats, in order to the unloading of the great ones, where the River is not deep enough. The
biggest of them carried Provisions for the Monastery of Troitza, whereof we have spoken elsewhere.
The Salute was the same with what we had made to those we had met before. About
nine in the morning,The City of Soratof. we pass'd in sight of the City of Soratof. It is seartd at 52. deg. 12. min.
elevation, in great plain four werstes from the River, and upon a branch which the Wolga
makes on that side. All the Inhabitants are Muscovian Musketiers, under the command of a
Weywode, sent thither by the Great Duke, for the preservation of the Country, against the
Tartars, called Kalmuches, who are possess'd of a vast Country, reaching from those parts as
far as the Caspian Sea, and to the River Iaika. These Tartars make frequent incursions as far as
the River Wolga, and are not so inconsiderable, but that they many times proclaim open War
against the Great Duke. From Samara to Soratof, are 350. werstes.
               The second, having a fair wind, we pass'd in sight of the Isles of Kriusna and Sapunofka,
which are at a small distance one from the other, and came to the Mountain of Achmats Kigori,
which ends at an Isle of the same name, 50. werstes from Saratof. This Mountain affords a very
pleasant Prospect, in as much as the top of it is clad with a perfectly-excellent verdure, the ascent
checquer'd with a soil or mold of several different colours, and the skirt of it is a very great
bank, so even, that it seems to have been done by hand. Twenty worstes from the Isle of Achmatsko
we saw that of Solotoi, and afterwards the Mountain of Sallottogori, or the Golden
Mountain. The Muscovites told us, that name was given it, for this reason, that heretofore
the Tartars had thereabouts surpriz'd a Muscovian Fleet, so richly loaden, that they divided
Gold and Silver by the Bushel. VVe were no sooner past by this Mountian, but we came in
sight of another, called Millobe, that is to say, Chalk. It reaches along the River 40. werstes,
having the top as even as if it had been done by a Level, and makes an insensible descent down to
the River, at the foot whereof are many Trees planted checquer-wise. After this, we came to
another Mountain on which we bestow'd the name of the Mountain of Pillars, for as much as
the rains having wash'd away the earth in several places, they look'd at a distance, like so many.
Pillars, out of order, of several colours, Blew, Red, Yellow, and Green. Here we met
with another great Boat, the Pilot whereof sent us word, that he had seen near Astrachan about
70. Cosaques, who has suffered them to pass without saying ought to them; but withall, that
some four days before ten of those Rogues had trapann'd him out of 500. Crowns, not by
setting on the Boat, where they should have met with resistance, since they could have made
their party good against a much greater number of Enemies; but they had taken that Boat
and the Anchor, which the Muscovites make use of when they go against the stream of the
River (as we have express'd elsewhere) and kept both till the fore-said sum was sent them.
In the evening, assoon as we had cast Anchor, we saw coming towards us ten Cosaques, who
went into a Boat, and cross'd to the other side of the River. The Ambassador Brugman immediately
commanded eight Musketiers, taken, some out of our retinue, some from among the
Soldiery, to follow the Cosaques, to find out what their design was, and to endeavour to bring
them aboard. But the Cosaques had time enough to get ashore, and retreat into the wood, whither
they also carried their Boat; so that it was far night ere our people return'd. Our Steward
was much troubled thereat, and represented to Brugman, how dangerous it was, to command
our people at such unseasonable hours, and that in a place where they could not be reliev'd;
but the other was so much incens'd at these remonstrances, that he gave the Steward very unworthy
language.
               Sept. 3. we saw on the left hand the River of Ruslana, and opposite thereto on the right hand,

the mountain of Vrakufs Karul, which is 150 werstes from Saratof. They say that a Tartarian
Prince, named Vrak, who giving Battel to the Cosaques in that place, was there kill'd and
buried, gave it the name. Thence we came to the mountain Kamaschinka, and to the river of
the same name. It rises out of the torrent of Iloba, which falls into the Don, which falls into
the Euxine Sea, and divides Asia and Europe. The Cosaques cross this river in little Boats, and
make their incursions as far as upon the Wolga; so that this is the most dangerous place of any.
We saw along the River-side, upon the right hand several wooden Crosses, set there
to signifie the Sepulchres of a great number of Muscovites, who had been kill'd there
by the Cosaques.
               Having pass'd this place, we perceived the Caravan of Persia and Tartary; it consisted of sixteen
great Boats, and six little ones. As soon as they saw us, the Mariners gave over rowing,
and went only as the stream carried them, to the end we might overtake them; which oblig'd
us to make all the Sail we could, and to do what else lay in our power, till we got up to them.
We soon express'd our joy, by the noise of our Trumpets, and saluted the Caraven with four
great Pieces; they answer'd with all their small shot, which oblig'd us to give them another
Volley.
               The principal persons of this Caravan, who could not have all met till they came to Samara,
were, a Tartarian Prince, named Massal, the Cuptzi, or the King of Persian's Merchant,
whom we spake of before, a Muscovian Poslanick, named Alexei Savinowits Romantzikou,
sent by the Great Duke to the King of Persia, an Ambassador from the Crim-Tartars, a Merchant,
or Factor from the Chancellor of Persia, and two Merchants of the Province of Kilan in
Persia.
               Immediately after these first general expressions of joy, we saw coming towards us a Muscovian
Officer, attended by a considerable number of Musketeers, who came to give us a Volley,
and inquire after our health, from the Prince of Tartary. As they came up to our Ship,
the Strelits discharg'd their Muskets, and then only the Officer came aboard, and made his
complement. As soon as he left us the Ambassadors sent to the said Prince, the Sieur Vchterits,
who was accompany'd by Thomas de Melleville, and our Muscovian Interpreter; and commanded
the Secretary of the Embassy, who took along with him the Persian Interpreter, to go
at the same time and complement the Cuptzi, who had in the interim sent one of his retinue to
do the like to the Ambassadors.
               The Secretary coming to the Lar-board-side of the Cuptzi's Vessel, would have got up into
it there, but his servants, acquainting him that the Masters Wife having her lodgings on that
side, it would not be so fit for him, so that he was forc'd to order the Boat to go about the Ship,
and to get in the other side.The King of Persia's Cuptzi. As we got in there stood several Servants, very handsome persons,
who took us by the arms to help us up, and conducted us to the Kuptzi's Chamber. We found
him sitting in a Couch, which was raised two foot high, and cover'd with a piece of the best
kind of Persian Tapestry. He had under him a coarse piece of Turkey Tapestry, setting crossleg'd,
according to the custome of his Countrey, resting his back on a Crimson Satin
cushion.
               He received us with much civility, putting his hands to his breast, and making a low inclination
of the head, which are the ordinary Ceremonies, wherewith they receive those-Persons,
whom they would do the greatest honour. He intreated us to sit down by him, which out of
complyance we did, but not without much trouble to us, as being not accustomed to continue
any long time in that posture. He very handsomely receiv'd our complement, and answer'd it
with so much of obligation and kindness, that we could not but be much taken with his civility.
He told us among other things, that he was extremely desirous to see his own Country, and
his own House, but the satisfaction it would be to him to see either of them, would not be
comparable to that which he had conceiv'd at the first sight of our Ship. He added, that as soon
as we were come into Persia, we should find the roughness and barbarism of the Nation, among
whom we then were, chang'd into an obliging civility, to pleasant conversation, and into a
manner of life absolutely inviting, and that attended with a freedom, which should be common
to us with all the Inhabitants of the Country. That, he hoped, at his arrival at the Court.
it would not be hard for him, with the assistance of his Friends there, to obtain the charge of
Mehemander, or Conductor, for our Embassy, since he had the happiness of our acquaintance
by the way: That then he would oblige us upon all occasions, and in the mean time intreated
us to dispose of his person, and whatever was in the Ship, as we pleased. He treated us with a
Collation, which was serv'd in, Plate Vermilion-gilt, and consisted only in Fruits, Grapes,
and Pistachoes, dry'd and pickled. The only drink we had, was an excellent kind of Muscovian
Aquavitae, wherein he first drunk the health of the two Ambassadors together, and afterwards
that of each of them by himself, which happened at the same time that his own was
drunk in our ship, which we knew to be so by the joint Volley of both the great Guns, and the
small shot. Taking our leave of him, he told us as a great Secret, that he had some news to
tell the Ambassadors; which was, that he had it from a very good hand, that the King of Poland

had sent an Ambassador to Schach Sefi, that he had taken his way by Constantinople and
Bagdet; that he was then upon his return to Astrachan, and that he had order, in his way, to
see the Great Duke; but that the Weywode would not permit him to pass, till he had first heard
from the Court. That this was all he knew of it, and that the Ambassadors might guess
at the rest as also what may have been the occasion of his Voyage and Negotiation.
               The other eminent Persons of the Caravan sent also to complement us, and to make proffer of
their services, intreating us to keep them company, and assuring us of their assistance if need
were. After a general Volley of all the Caravan, we parted, and kept on our course. At night
we had a great Tempest, with two extraordinary Thunder-claps, and some flashes of Lightning;
but the weather soon became fair again, and we had a great calm.
               Sept. 4. being Sunday, just as our Minister was beginning his Sermon, came aboard us several
Tartars, whom Mussal the Tartarian Prince of Circassia sent to tell us, that, his disposition
would not suffer him to give the Ambassadors a personal visit, but as soon as his health would
permit him to take the air, it should be the first thing he did. The equipage of those who came
along with the Person employ'd in this Message my very well deserve a little remark from us.
As to his Person, he was somewhat of the tallest, his complexion of an Olive-colour, his hair
long, greasie, and black as Jet, and his beard of the same colour and fashion. He had upon his
upper Garment, some black-Sheep-skin, the woolly side out, a Callot, or close Cap, on his
head, and his countenance such as a Painter might well take for an original, if he were to represent
the Devil. His retinue were in no better order, having about them only Coats, or Garments
of some very coarse Cloath, brown or black. We entertain'd them with certain Gobelets
of Aquavitae, and sent them sufficiently drunk to their Ship.
               About noon we came to the River of Bolloclea, in the mid-way between Kamuschinka,
and Zariza, 90 werstes distant from either of them. Having sail'd sixteen werstes
further, we came to a very high hill of sand, called Strehlne, near which we stayd all
night.
               Sept. 5. we had hardly weigh'd Anchor, but the current forc'd us upon a sand-bank, where
we found but five foot and a half water. While we were busied about getting off the Ship, the
Caravan got before us, and made towards Zariza, with a design to take in there some other
Muskettiers for its convoy to Astrachan. About noon, we got to a place whence we might
have gone in less than a days time as far as the River Don, called by Ptolomey and other Antient
Geographers Tanais, which advances in that place as far as within seven leagues of the Wolga.The first Branch of Wolga.
taking its course towards the East. A little lower, near Achtobska Vtska, the Wolga divides
it self into two branches, whereof one, which takes into the Country on the left hand, goes a
course contrary to that of the great River, taking towards East-North-East; but about one
werste thence, it re-assumes its former course, and returns towards the South-East??? so
to fall into the Caspian Sea. In this place I found the Elevation to be 48 degrees, 51
minutes.
               Five werstes from the River, and seven from Zariza, may yet be seen the ruins of a City,
which they say was built by Tamberlane. It was called Zaarefgorod, that is to say, the Royal
City; its Palace and Walls were of Brick, which they still carry thence to build Walls,
Churches and Monasteries at Astrachan; even at the time of our passage that way; they were
loading several great Boats with Brick, bound for the place aforesaid.
               In this place, we saw a Fisher-man, who coming close by our Ship-side, took a Bieluga, or
white-fish,
which was above eight foot long, and above four foot broad. It was somewhat
like a Sturgeon, but much whiter, and had a wider mouth. They kill it much after the same
manner as Oxen are kill'd among us, by first stunning it with a knock with a mallet. They
sold it us for fifty pence.
               Sept. 6. We overtook the Caravan, at Zariza, where most of the Passengers were landed,
and lodg'd in Tents, upon the River-side, expecting the Convoy, which was to be sent from
the adjacent Towns: but the wind being still fair for us, we kept on our course. The City of
ZarizaThe City of Zariza. is distant from Soratof 350 werstes, and lies on the right side of the River, at the bottom
of a Hill, fortify'd with five Bastions, and as many wooden Towers. It hath no other
Inhabitants than about 400 Strelits or Muskettiers, who serve against the incursions of the
Tartars and Cosaques, and are oblig'd to Convoy the Boats which go up, and come down the
River. There I found the elevation to be 49 d. and 42. m.
               From the City of Zariza to Astrachan, and the Caspian Sea, there is only wast grounds and
heaths, and so barren a soyl, that being not able to bring forth any kind of Corn, all that Country,
even the City of Astrachan it self, is forc'd to send for Wheat to Casan, whence there comes
such abundance, that it is cheaper at Astrachan than it is at Moscou.
               Below Zariza lies the Isle of Zerpinske. It is twelve werstes in length, and the Souldiers of
the Garrison of Zariza, send their Cattel thither . The Cosaques of those parts, having
observ'd that the Wives and Daughters of those Soldiers crossed over to the Island without
any Guard, went thither one day after them, surpriz'd, ravish'd, and sent them back to their

husbands,1366. without doing them any other mischief. Behind this Isle, there falls into the Wolga a
little River, which rises out of the Don, but it hath hardly water enough for little Boats, which
I conceive may be the reason, why Geographers represent it not in their Maps; there being only
Isaac Massa, who hath put it into his, and calls it Kamous. The heats were there??? abouts so
great in the moneth of September, as that of the Dog-dayes is not more insupportable in Germany;
yet the Muscovites affirm'd, they were but ordinary.
               Sept. 7. The weather chang'd, and a Tempest following, we could not advance much. Having
sayl'd ten werstes, we saw, on the right hand, a Gibet erected upon a high reddish Hill. It was
the first we had seen in those parts, and we were told it was set up by the Weywode of the next
City, for the execution of the Cosaques, he should take within his Government, and that he
gave them no other quarter, but that their Camerades suffered not??? the bodies to hang there
above five or six dayes.
               The same day an humour took the Ambassador Brugman, to cause all the Servants belonging
to the Embassy to come before him, to whom he said, that he had reason to believe, that there
were many among them, who express'd little kindness and respect towards him, and, if occasion
serv'd, would do him all the ill Offices lay in their power, and consequently that his desire was,
that the Musicians, the Guards, and the Lacqueyes, should take their Oaths to be faithful to
him. Answer was made him, that his distrust was ill-grounded; that they saw not any reason
why they should be oblig'd to a thing so extraordinary, and that they were so far from having
any ill design against him, that, on the contrary, they were all ready to lay down their lives to
do him any service; but that they intreated him, for his part, to spare them as much as might be,
and to treat them more mildly than he had done: which he promised to do, but it was one of
those promises that are either kept or broken.
               The same day we met with a great Boat, the Master whereof sent some Mariners aboard us,
to desire us to pity their sad condition, and to relieve them with a little bread, in the extremity
they were in, having not eaten ought for the space of four dayes. They told us it was three
weeks since they came from Astrachan, and that they had been robb'd in their way by thirty
Cosaques, who had taken away all their Provisions. VVe gave them a sack full of pieces of bread,
for which they gave us thanks, with their ordinary Ceremonies, bowing their heads down to
the ground.
               Forty Werstes from Zariza, lies the Isle of Nassonofska, and opposite thereto, on the right
hand, a great flat Mountain of the same name. Between the Isle and the Mountain there is a
kind of a Grott, where the Cosaques had, some years before, kill'd a great number of Muscovites,
who had lay'n there in ambush, to surprise the others. In the evening, a certain Fisher-man
brought us a kind of fish wich we had never seen before. The Muscovites called it
Tziberika, and it was above five foot long, with a long and broad snout like the Bill of a wild
Drake, and the body full of black and white spots, like the Dogs of Poland, but much more regular,
unless it were about the belly, where it was all white. It had an excellent good taste, and
was at least as pleasant as that of Salmon. he sold us also another kind of fish much resembling
a Sturgeon, but much less, and incomparably more delicate, whereof there are abundance in the
Wolga.
               The 8. The Caravan, which we had left at Zariza, came up to us near a Cape, called Popowitska
Iurga, upon this accompt that the son of a Muscovian Pope or Priest, who had sometime
headed the Cosaques and Bandits, was wont to make his retreat, and appoint his rendezvous
at that place. They count from Zariza to that place 70. werstes, and thence to the Mountain
of Kamnagar, which lay on our right hand, 40. werstes. The River thereabouts is full of
Isles and Sand-banks, by which the Caravan was no less incommodated than we were, though
their Vessels were much less than ours. Twenty werstes lower there is a very high Island, four
werstes in length, called Wesowi, near a River of the same name, which falls into the Wolga on
the right hand. Thirty werstes lower, the wind forc'd us into a corner, where the River of
Wolodinerski Vtsga falls into the Wolga. But in regard we were loath to let slip the opportunity
of making a great dayes journey, which the fairness of that wind put us in hope we might do,
we with much difficulty made a shift to get out, and afterwards pass'd by the Country of Stupin,
thirty werstes from the City of Tzornogar, which was the first we were to come at the
next day. Ten werstes lower, the Wolga puts out a second branch on the left hand, called Achtobenisna
Vtsga,The second branch of the Wolga. which joyns its waters to those of Achtobska, whereof we spoke before.
Thence we sayl'd five werstes further, where the whole fleet cast Anchor, near the Isle of Ossina,
which is seven werstes from Tzornogar. So that, that day we got 135. werstes, or 27. German
Leagues, that is, at the least as far as it is from Paris to Saumur.
               From this Countrey quite down to Astrachan, on both sides of the River, there grows
abundance of Liquorice, having a stalk as big as ones arm, and about some four foot high. The
seed of it is much like a vitch, and lies in cods upon the top of the stalk. The Champain part of
Media is cover'd therewith, especially towards the River Araxes; but the juyce of it is much
sweeter, and the root much bigger than that which grows in Europe.
               
                  
Sept. 9.1636. There rose a wind, which soon grew into a Tempest, and brought us about noon
before the little City of Tzornogar, where we stay'd. It was but some nine years before,
that the Great Duke had given order for the building of this City,The City of Tzornogar. which lies 200. werstes from
Zariza, some half a League lower than it is now: but the great floods having wash'd away the
earth along the shore, in such great quantities, that the course of the River seem'd to be thereby
diverted, and that it would be ill coming ashore there, they translated the City to the
place where it is now. It is seated upon a high shore, on the right side of the River, and is
fortify'd with eight wooden Towers, and a Rampier with thick planks, having no other
Inhabitants than three or four hundred Souldiers, who are kept there to secure the Countrey
against the incursions of the Cosaques and Kalmuckas Tartars. There is at each corner of the
City, which is square, a particular place for the Sentinels to stand, erected upon four great
poles, whence they have a full prospect into a spacious plain as far as they can see, without
the least interposition of any wood, or other eminency.
               What oblig'd the Great Duke to order the building of this City, was, the mischiefs done
thereabouts by the Cosaques, but particularly, the defeat of a Caravan, of 1500. Muscovites:
who were there surpriz'd some ten years before. It had a very strong Convoy, but the River
being extremely swift in that place, and the Convoy being gone before, the Cosaques, who had
suffered the Soldiers to pass by, came out of their Ambushes, set upon the Caravan, kill'd seven
or eight hundred men, and took away all before the Convoy could come up, the violence of the
current not suffering it to get up the River time enough to relieve them. Between that place
and the Astrachan, there are no Trees to be seen on the River-side.
               The 10. We left Tzornogar, but the wind turning against us, we could hardly get ten
werstes that day. About noon, some fisher-men brought us a noble Carp, which weigh'd at
least thirty pounds, with eight other fish, of those they call Sandates, the fairest we had seen in
all our Voyage. We would have paid for them, but they refus'd our money, and told us, that
they fish'd there for certain Merchants of Moscou, who having farm'd the fishing of that place
from the Great Duke, would be sure to have them severely punish'd, if ever it should come to
their knowledge, that they had sold any fish. We soon found their design was to be paid in
Aquavitae, accordingly a quart was ordered to be given them, wherewith they seemed to be very
well satisfy'd.
               Sept. 11. The wind and weather fair, we got 120. werstes, but without any accident worth
noting, save that about noon, we pass'd by the Mountain of Polowon, so called, because half-way
between Astrachan and Zariza, 250. werstes, distant from each of them. We pass'd over
the night near the Isle of Kyssar, where the Ambassador Brugman, who was upon the Guard,
hearing that the Sentinel had discovered a great Boat, which the current of the River brought
somewhat near our Vessel, and that upon calling to them, no body answer'd, commanded fifteen
Muskets to be shot off, and at the same time, a great Gun to be fired. All took the Alarm;
but hardly was every man got to his station, ere they might perceive coming to the ship-side a
small boat, guided by only one man, who gave us this accompt of himself, that his boat was
loaden with Salt, and that his seven Camerades, being acquainted with some of the Caravan,
had been so treated by them with Aquavitae, that being all dead asleep, he had been forc'd to
let the boat go with the stream. Our Pilot knew the man, as being an Inhabitant of Nise,
whereupon we gave him some Gobelets of Aquavitae, and sent him back to his boat. The next
day, he came to acknowledge our kindness to him, by a present of certain Sturgeons.
               The night following, the wind continuing fair, we thought fit to improve the opportunity,
and so set sayl by three in the morning. Sept. 12. We soon came, upon the left hand, to a
third branch of the Wolga,The third branch of the Wolga. called Buch wostowa, which falls into the two precedent. Thence we
came to the Isle of Coppono, from which the name Coponogar is deriv'd to the County, which is
opposite thereto, on the right side of the River. From this place, there are 150. werstes to
Astrachan.The fourth branch of the Wolga. Twenty werstes lower, the Wolga makes a fourth branch, on the left hand, called
Danilofska Vtsga, which mingles not with any of the other three, but disembogues it self
by a particular Chanel into the Caspian Sea. Fifteen werstes thence lies, in the midst of the River,
the Isle of Katarinski, which is little, but very pleasant, by reason of the Wood, and other
plants that grow on it. Not far from it, we saw upon a Sand-bank the Carkass of a Boat,
which had been cast away there and was half rotten. Being seen at some distance, a man might
take it for a Fort, built there by the Cosaques, nay there were those who imagined they had
seen some of them, which occasion'd a command to be given that some shot should be made into
the Wood; but it was done with so much Precipitation, that one of the Muskets, breaking in
the hands of our Cook, the splinters took off the Thumb of his left hand, and hurt him in the
forehead and breast. We stay'd the next night, near the Isle of Piruski, 80. werstes from Astrachan,
after we had sail'd a hundred that day.
               Sept. 13. while we were, after morning prayer, reading some Chapters out of the Bible,
and among others the XIII of Numbers, where Moses speaks of the fertility of the Land of
Canaan, and the excellency of its Fruits, especially of the Grapes, brought thence by the Spies,

there came two Boats from Astrachan, which brought us some Fruits to sell. We were so surpriz'd
thereat, that, for my part, I am in doubt whether that of the Holy Land could be better;
so delicious were the Melons and Peaches, and the Kernels of the Grapes were as big as Nuts.
This day betimes in the morning, we came in sight of another Branch of the Wolga, called Mituska,A fifth Branch of the Wolga.
which at some distance from the River, is divided into two other Branches; whereof
the one is united to the Danilofski Vtsga, which we spoke of before, and the other falls again
into the main river, at some werstes thence. We were told, that was the most dangerous place
of all the river, by reason those Robbers had their rendevouz and retreating places thereabouts.
For indeed, we saw, between two Isles, a great number of Cosaques, at whom the Ambassador
Brugman caus'd a great Gun to be fired. Five werstes lower, and 70 from Astrachan, we
came to the last sand-bank, which is called Kabangameel. Five werstes thence, to the Promontory
of Kabangengar; and five lower, to the Isle of Itziburki, where we stay'd that night, 50
werstes from Astrachan.
               We saw in those parts, as also afterwards near Astrachan, and upon the Caspian Sea, a
kind of wild Geese, or rather Cormorants, which the Muscovites call Babbes, which in a
manner cover'd the river side; but of them more at large, when we come to the description of
the City, and of the Country of Nagaia.
               The 14. We were stay'd by a contrary wind, and a tempest coming from the South-East,
so that we could hardly advance two werstes, ere we were forc'd to cast Anchor, and to continue
there till the next day??? We lay at 80 foot water. The Tartarian Prince sent us a Present of
Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae, with notice, that if we liked it, we might have more.
               Sept. 15. the wind changing, we set sail by four in the morning, taking our course Southward,
and betimes in the morning, came before the Isle of Busan, 25 werstes from Astrachan;
and afterwards to a sixth Branch of the River Wolga,A sixth Branch of the Wolga. called Baltzick, within 15 werstes
of the City. The plain, which reaches from that place to Astrachan, gave us the sight of the
City by 8 in the morning. Three werstes lower, and 12 from the City, there is a seventh Branch
of the Wolga,The seventh Branch of the Wolga. called Knilusse, which makes the Island of Dilgoi, within which Astrachan is
seated, and having compass'd the Isle, it falls into the Caspian Sea, by many several chanels, or
ostiaes. We came to Astrachan about noon,The Ambassadors come to Astrachan. and whereas the City lies on the other side of the
River, which, in that place, divides Europe and Asia, we may say, that, as we departed out of
that part of the World, which we may in some manner call our Country, we made our first
step into the other. We made some stay before the City, in the midst of the River, and saluted
it with a Volley both of all our great Guns, and small shot, whereat the Inhabitants, who
were come in great numbers to the river-side, were the more surpriz'd, by reason they were
not accustomed to hear Thunders of that kind.
               It will not be amiss in this place, by a short digression, to give an account of the situation of
Astrachan,A description of the City of strachan. of the qualities of the Country, and the life of the Inhabitants. The Antient Geographers,
as Ptolomy, Strabo, and others, who follow them, had no knowledge of these Tartars,
no more than their neighbours, and have not made any mention of them, but only under a general
name of Scythians aud Sarmatians, though they should indeed have been distinguish'd into so
many different Nations, suitable to the diversity there is in their Names, their Language, and
manner of Life; in all which they have nothing common one with the other. Mathias de Michou,
a Physician, and Canon of Cracovia, who liv'd at the beginning of the last age, says
that those, who confound the Tartars with those Nations, which the Antients called Getae, Scythae,
and Sarmatae, are much mistaken, in as much as the Tartars have not been known, but
since the thirteenth Age. For in May 1211. there appear'd a Comet, which, having its tail
towards the West, and menacing the Don and Russia, presag'd the invasion which the Tartars
made into those parts the year following. They were certain Indian Lords, who having kill'd
their King, David, got away, first, towards the Euxine Sea, near the Palus Meotides, where
lived the antient Getae, whence they afterwards advanc'd towards the Don, and thence to the
river Wolga, where they live to this day. The same Author distinguishes them into four species;
to wit, the Zavlhenses, (whom he also calls Czahadai) Precopenses, Cosanenses, and
Nohacenses, and says, they are the Tartars, who live along the river Wolga, (which he calls
Volha) those of Precop, those of Casan, and those of Nagaia, who are those of whom we are
to treat of at present. Alexander Guagnin, of Verona, divides them into eight Colonies, and
gives them other names; but it is our design to entertain the Reader only with what we have
seen, and to discover that part of Tartaria through which we travel'd. We say then, that they
call Nagaia,A description of Nagaia. that part of Tartary, which lies between the rivers of Wolga, and Iaika, as far
as the Caspian Sea, whereof Astrachan is the principal City. It is reported that a Tartar-King,
named Astra-chan built it, and gave it his own name: So that the Baron of Herberstein
is very much mistaken, when he says, in his Relation of Muscovy, that it is some days
journey distant from the River, whereas it is seated on the river-side, and in the Isle of Dolgoi,
made there by two branches of the said River.
               After several very exact observations, I found the Elevation of the Pole there, to be 26 degrees,

22. minutes, and the Climat so hot, that in the Months of September and October, the
heats were still as great as they are in Germany in the height of Summer, especially when the
wind blew from-wards the Wolga, East, or North-East. 'Tis true, the South-wind was there
somewhat colder, and brought with it the inconveniences, nay indeed the scent, of the neighbouring
Sea, wherewith it infected the whole Air. At our return that way, our stay there happened
to be in Iune, Iuly and August, and yet the heats were not absolutely insupportable, in regard
they were moderated by the coolness, which the South-wind continually brought along
with it. But what is to be most admir'd, is, that, in this hot Climat, the Winter, which lasts
but two months; is so exceeding cold, that the River is frozen up, and bears Sledges. Which
is contrary to what other Authors say of it, yet the Reader may take it for most certain.
               The Island of Dolgoi is sandy and barren,The Isle of Dolgoi. insomuch, that some Gardens, and Lands cultivated
by the Inhabitants of Astrachan, excepted, it produces nothing at all, no more than does
the Continent, on the right hand; but on the left, towards the river Iaika, there are very good
pastures. On this side the Wolga, West-ward, lies a long Heath of above 70. German leagues,
reaching as far as the Euxin Sea, and towards the South, another, of above 80. leagues, along
the Caspian Sea: as we found at our return from Persia, when it was our chance to measure it,
by eleven very tedious dayes journeys. Yet are not these Deserts so barren, but they produce
more Salt,Salt-pits??? than the marshes in France and Spain do. The Inhabitants of those parts call them
Mozakofski, Kainkowa, and Gwostofski, which are ten, fifteen, and thirty werstes from Astrachan,
and have salt veins, which the Sun bakes and causes to swim upon the face of the water
about a finger thick, much like Rock-Christal, and in such abundance, that, paying an Impost
of a half-penny upon every Poude, that is, forty pound weight, a man may have as much as
he pleases. It smells like that of France, and the Muscovites drive a great Trade with it, bringing
it to the side of the Wolga, where they put it up in great heaps, till they have the convenience
of transporting it elsewhere. Petreius, in his History of Muscovy, sayes, that within two
leagues of Astrachan, there are two mountains, which he calls Busin, which afford such abundance
of Rock-salt, that, if thirty thousand men were perpetually at work about it, they would
not be able to exhaust the pits. But I could learn nothing of those imaginary Mountains. Certain
indeed it is, that the salt-veins we speak of, are inexhaustible, and that as soon as you have
taken off one crust or face of it, there comes up another. The same Petreius is also much mistaken,
when he sayes, that Media, Persia and Armenia, are supply'd with Salt from these
Mountains, whereas these Countries have Salt marshes of their own, as also Muscovy hath, as
we shall see in the sequel of this Relation.
               From Astrachan to the Caspian Sea, are twelve leagues, and thereabouts, the river does so
abound with fish, that we bought twelve large Carps for two pence, and two hundred young
Sturgeons, which are very delicate there, for half a Crown. It produces also Lobsters, or Seacrevices,
which multiply in a manner to infinity, by reason the Muscovites and Tartars eat not
of them. The Isles which are in the river afford habitations for all manner of Fowl, especially
an infinite number of wild Geese and Ducks, which the Tartars take with Falcons and Hawks,
and are very expert in the ordering of those Birds for that kind of sport. They are also excellently
well skill'd in the hunting of the wild Bore; but in regard their Religion permits them
not to eat of it, they sell them for a small matter to the Muscovites.
               As to the Fruits of those parts,The Fruits of Nagaia??? it is certain, that, both in goodness and beauty, they yield
not to those of Persia, especially Apples, Quinces, Nuts, Peaches, and Melons, but above all,
that kind of Melons, or rather Citruls, which the Muscovites call Arpus, the Turks and Tartars,
Karpus, because they are extremely cooling, and the Persians, Hinduanes, because they
had the first seeds of them from the Indies. This Fruit is excellently good, and very pleasant to
the tast, as also to the eye, having the rind of a lively-green colour, the meat of a pale Carnation,
and the seed black. The Tartars, who brought them to the City in Carts, sold them
two or three a penny.
               It is not many years since that they have had Grapes among them, the Inhabitants of Astrachan
being oblig'd for these to the Merchants of Persia, who brought the first sets thither, which
an old Monk of a Convent that is in the Suburbs planted in his Garden. The Great Duke hearing
that it had taken with good success, and having tasted the Grape, sent order to the Monk,
in the year 1613. to improve his stock, which he did, and that with such increase, that at the
time of our being there, there was no house almost, but had its Arbours and Walks set about
with Vines, to the so great advantage of the Planters, that the Master of the house where I
lodg'd told me, the Vines he had about his house had yielded him a hundred Crowns the year
before. These Grapes, with some other Fruits, were either sent to the Great Duke, or sold
to the neighbouring Weywodes: but some years since, they have planted a Vine there, which
hath yielded in one year above 60. Pipes of excellent Wine.
               The Monk I spoke of was living at our being there, and was a hundred and five years of age???
He was a German, born in Austria, and had been carried away prisoner very young by some
Turkish Soldiers, who had sold him into Muscovy, where he had chang'd his Religion, and

became a Monk. He was at that time Superior of the Monastery, and still remembred some German
words, but very few. He was a very good natur'd Man, and shew'd how much he was
taken with our conversation, by the frequent visits he made us: but as soon as he had taken off
two or three Dishes of Aquavitae, he was subject to the ordinary weaknesses of those of his age,
threw away his staff, and fell a dancing, though not with over much confidence.
               Heretofore,Its Inhabitants. all Nagaia was inhabited by Tartars, who had their particular King, and held
a very fair correspondency with their Neighbours of Casan and Crim, with whom they also ran
the same fortune after their defeat. For the Great Duke, Iohn Basilouits, having reduc'd under
his Jurisdiction the Tartars of Casan, in the year 1552. two years after, set upon those of Nigaia,
and took the City of Astrachan by assault, Aug. 1. 1554. He forc'd thence all the Tartars,
and, having peopled the City with Muscovites, he compassed it with a stone wall, and
added some other Fortifications: but it was the Great Duke Michael Foederouits, that made
it larger than it was, by adding thereto that part, which is called Strelitzagorod, so called
from the Muscovian Muskettiers, who are quartered therein. The City is eight thousand
Geometrical feet about; and that side towards the River, which, in that place, is two thousand,
two hundred and sixteen foot broad, affords a pleasant Prospect, by reason of the great
number of Turrets and Steeples of stone, which look very delightfully at a distance, but within,
it is not answerable thereto, the Houses being all of Wood, and not well built. Some told us,
that there were in the City above 500 great Pieces of brass, and among others, many Mortar-pieces???
The Garrison consisted of nine Pricasses, or Regiments, in each of which were 500 Muskettiers,
under the command of two Weywodes, one Diak, and several Captains, and other Officers,
who have an eye upon the Tartars, whom they have reason to be distrustful
of.
               This City being seated upon the Frontiers of two of the most considerable parts of the world,
it may well be, that not only the Tartars of Chrim, Precop, Bugar, and Nagaia, and the Muscovites,
but also the Persians and Armenians (who are Christians) nay the Indians trade thither;
and these last have a particular market-place there for themselves. All which improves
the Commerce of the City, so that the Customs, which there are very low, amount to above
25000 Crowns a year.
               The Inhabitants of the Country, who are the Tartars of Crim and Nagaia, are not permitted
to live within the City, but are thrust into a place without the City, which is hedg'd and
palizadoed, or forc'd to live in Huts, which they set up and down, in the open Fields, because
they are not suffer'd to build Cities, nor to fortify their Towns nor Villages with walls. Their
Huts are made either with Bull-rushes or Canes, being about twelve foot diameter, round, and
towards the top, like the Coops wherein Chickens are kept in Europe. In the midst of that
place, which serves them for a Roof, there is a hole, through which goes out a stick, having
at the end a piece of coarse Cloath, which they turn to the Wind, to facilitate the going out
of the Smoak, and which they draw in, when the Turf, or Cow-dung, which they burn, is
reduc'd to a live-Coal or Ashes. When the weather is very cold, they put over the Hut a covering
of coarse Cloath, whereby they so keep in the heat, that they pass over whole days
without stirring out, with their Wives and Children, not feeling any inconvenience. They
have no fixt habitation in the Summer-time, but stay in those places where they find the best
Pasture for their Cattel. When that begins to fail, they put their Huts into Carts, and their
Wives, Children, and Goods upon Camels, Oxen, and Horses, and so they ramble up
and down the Country, whence it comes that the Muscovites call them Poloutski, Vagabonds.
               At the beginning of Winter they all come near and about Astrachan, and lodge themselves in
several crews or troops, which lye not at so great a distance but that they can relieve one another
against the Malmukes Tartars, otherwise called the Tartars of Buchar, their common and
irreconcilable enemies, who make their incursions up and down the Country, from Astrachan
and the Caspian Sea, as far as Sorat of. The Tartars who live near the river Iaika are their tormentors
on the other side, disturbing their quiet by continual Alarms, when the river is frozen.
Whence it comes, that the Muscovites, to prevent their being ruin'd by the incursions of
those people, furnish them with Arms, out of the Great Duke's Magazine, whether they are
oblig'd to return them, as soon as the River and the ways are thaw'd: for they are not permitted
to have any, either defensive or offensive Arms in the Summer.
               'Tis true, they do not pay the Great Duke any Taxes or impositions, but are oblig'd
to serve him against his Enemies, which they do the more gladly, and without any compulsion,
out of the hope of booty, as do also those of Daguestan, whom we shall speak of hereafter.
               These Tartars have Princes of their own, as also Commanders in time of War, and particular
Judges of their own Nation: but lest they should do any thing contrary to their allegiance
to the Great Duke, there are always some of their Myrses, or Princes, kept as Hostages in
the Castle of Astrachan.
               
                  
The Tartars of Nagaia and Chrim, are for the most part of little stature, and fat, having
large faces and little eyes, and being of an Olive-colour. The men have ordinarily as many
wrinkles in their faces as old Women, little beard, and the head all shaven.
               All they have about them is a Casaque, or Garment of a coarse grey Cloath, upon which
those of Nagaia wear for the most part a loose Mantle of black Sheep-kin, with a Cap of the
same stuff, the Wool-side outward. The Women, who are not unhandsom, are commonly
clad in white linnen Cloath, and have about their heads a Coif of the same stuff, folded, and
round, like those pots which some make use of in the Wars, having in the middle a hole, fit to
put a plume of feathers in. Upon this Coif, and on both sides, there hang a great many Copecs,
or Muscovian Pence.
               They many times vow their first-born, or some one of their other Children, to God, or some
Imam, or Saint. And that these Nazarites may be distinguish'd from others, if it be a Girl,
she wears a Ring with a Ruby, a Turqueze stone, or Coral in the Nostril; If a Boy, he wears
it in his right ear. The Persians have the same custom; but of that more at large hereafter
Children go stark naked, and are all big-belly'd.
               The Tartars live upon what their Cattel, their hunting and fishing supplies them with. Their
Cattel are large and fair, as that of Poland. Their sheep, as also those of Persia, have great
tayls, which are all fat, weighing 20. or 30. pounds, the ears hanging down as our Spaniels,
flat-nosed. Their Horses are little and mishapen, but strong and hardy. They have some Camels,
but they have most of them two bunches on their backs, which they call Buggur, those
which have but one, and by them called Towe, are very scarce among them.
               Their ordinary food is fish dry'd in the Sun,Their food??? which serves them instead of bread. They have
also certain Cakes made of Meal, Rice, and Millet, fry'd in Oyl or Honey. They eat Camels
and Horse-flesh, and drink water and milk. Mares milk they much esteem; with this they treated
our Ambassadors, when we gave them a Visit, taking it out of a nasty Leather-bag, to present
it to us.
               They are for the most part Mahumetans,Their Religion. of the Turkish Sect, hating that of the
Persians.
Some have made profession of the Muscovian Religion, and have been baptiz'd.
They receiv'd us civilly, at least as far as that Nation is capable of civility. One of their Princes
would have given the Ambassadors the divertisement of Hawking, but the Weywode would not
permit it.
               The time we stay'd at Astrachan was spent in providing all things necessary for the prosecution
of our Voyage. The Persians of the Caravanne, and the Tartarian Prince sent often some
of their people to complement us; they also made us Presents, and came in peson to Visit us.
For, we had hardly cast Anchor before Astrachan, and made known our arrival by the discharging
of the great Guns, but the Cuptzi, and the other Persian Merchants, who were there
but a little before us, sent us a noble Present of all sorts of fruit, Arpus's, Melons, Apples,
Apricocks, Peaches, and Grapes, with this excuse, that being, as we were, strangers in the
Countrey, they could make us no better Presents, but when we were come to Persia, they
would be absolutely at our disposal. The Ambassadors having answer'd this civility, sent
them, as also to the Tartarian Prince, some of all sorts of distill'd waters, and sweet
meat.
               The next day after our arrival,A custom of Persia to make Presents to persons of quality. we were Visited by many Persian Merchants, who were desirous
to see our ship. Not one among them but brought some Present of fruit according to
the custom of their Countrey, which permits them not to come empty-handed before persons
of quality. They treaed us wth much kindness and familiarity, which the more delightfully
surpriz'd us,  that we had but then parted from a Nation famous for its incivility and barbarism.
And wereas thenc forward we were to converse and negotiate with Persians, we thought
it not amiss to allow them the liberty to do what they pleas'd in our ship, and were extremely
pleas'd to see them get all so heartily and so kindly drunk, that some, as they parted, fell into
the water; nay one of their Merchants, an aged man, falling fast asleep upon the Deck, stay'd
there all night. This good man was so kind in his Wine, that taking a glass of French-wine
from one of the Ambassadors who had drunk to him, and perceiving they made him this complement,
that, after the excellent Wines of his own Countrey, he could not taste those of ours,
he made answer, that, though it were poyson, yet coming from the Ambassadors hand, he
would take it off.
               The 17.The Cuptzi's Present. The Persian Cuptzi sent us a Present of two sacks of Rice, the grain whereof was
very white and very ig, and a Vessel of preserv'd Garlick, which was very pleasant to the taste.
How the Persians preserve it shall be said hereafter. Many of the Cuptzi's Domesticks came also
to see us, and brought along with them some Mariners, who were astonish'd at the bigness of
our ship, and said all, that it would not be fit for the Caspian Sea, whereof the high, and in a
manner contiguous Waves, would overwhelm it, and there was a necessity of taking down the
Masts. They all affirm'd, that the Culsum (so they call the Caspian Sea) had never born so
great a ship; which yet they only said in comparison of their own, which are only little Barks,

made like our bathing-tubs in Europe,1366, so to take up but two or three foot water, having neither
Hatches nor Pump, insomuch that they are forc'd to cast out the Water with shovels. They
have but one great sayl, no more than the Muscovites, and know not what it is to sayl with a
side-wind; so that when a Tempest overtakes them, they are forc'd either to go with the wind
or cast Anchor: but commonly they go within Pistol-shot of the shore.
               The Persians having left us, the Ambassadors sent to the Chief Weywode, whose name was
Foedor Vasilouits, a Present, which was a large drinking Cup Vermilion-gilt, intreating his advice
for the continuation of their Voyage, and to know whether we should prosecute it by Sea
or by Land. The Weywode desir'd a days time or two to consider of it, and to take the advice
of persons skill'd in Sea-affairs: but we stay'd not for his answer, and resolv'd, for several reasons,
to continue our Voyage by Sea.
               Sept. 19. The Tartar-Prince having sent us word that he would give us a Visit aboard our
Ship, we sent our shallop to Land, to bring him aboard. he brought with him another Tartar-Prince,
and a retinue of about 40 persons, besides those who belong'd to Alexei Sauonouits,
the Great Duke's Poslanick. He was habited after the Muscovian fashion, his Vestment embroider'd
with Gold and Pearls, and his person and deportment was suitable to the greatness of
his birth: for he had a very good countenance, a very clear complexion, and black hair, being
about 28 years of age, of an excellent good humour, and eloquent. He was receiv'd into the
ship with the noise of our Trumpets, and the fiering of three great Pieces, and conducted to the
Ambassadors Chamber, through the Guards and Soldiers in their Arms.
               After some two hours discourse, during which he was entertain'd with Musick, he desir'd to
see the ship. He was shew'd it all, and at last brought into the Hall, where he found a Collation
ready, but he would not sit down, and took leave of the Ambassadors, to return to the City.
At his departure, he had the same honour done him as at his entrance.
               Sept. 20. The Ambassadors sent to the Lord Naurus,The Cuptzi visits the Ambassadors. the King of Persia's Cuptzi, to entreat
him to honour them with a Visit in their ship, which he promis'd to do. The next day he came,
accompany'd by another rich Merchant, named Noureddin Mahomet, and the Pristaf, which
the Weywode had sent to conduct him. His reception was like that of the Tartar-Prince. After
the Collation, at which pass'd several good discourses, our Musick playing all the time, they
entreated us to give theirs leave to come in, which consisted of Hawboyes and Timbrels. Their
Timbrels were made of earth, and were not much unlike our Butter-pots, making a very
strange noise, though their playing on them was very regular and well carried on. The Collation
had put them into so good an humour, that in their return we could hear their Musick, nay a
good while after they were got into the City.
               The 22.The Weywodes Presents. The Weywode sent his Presents to the Ambassadors, which consisted in twenty Flitches
of Bacon, twelve large Fishes that had been hung up in the smoak, a Barrel of Cavayar, a
Tun of Beer, and another of Hydromel. About noon, there came aboard us two of the Polish
Ambassadors Servants, whom the Cuptzi had spoken of, to complement the Ambassadors in
their Master's name, and on the behalf of the Ambassador, sent from the King of Persia to the
King of Poland, bringing along with them a bottle of Scherab, or Persian Wine. The Polish Ambassador
was a Iacobin Frier, named Iohn de Lucca; and the Persian, an Armenian Archbishop,
named Augustinus Basecius. The persons sent to us were two Capuchins, one an Italian, the
other a French-man. They told us they had been five moneths at Astrachan, and complain'd
much of the ill treatment they had receiv'd there, in that they were detain'd as Prisoners, and
not permitted to go any farther.
               The same day, the Ambassadors acquainted the Weywode with their desire to Visit the Tartar-Prince,
entreating him, to that end, to accommodate them with horses for themselves, and
some of their retinue; which he very civilly did, sending the next day, by his Gentleman of the
horse, to the River-side, the number of horses we desired.
               Being come to a Lodging prepar'd for us without the City,The Ambassadors visit the Tartar-Prince and having acquainted the Tartar-Prince
with our arrival, we walk'd towards his Lodging, where he expected us. The Prince
having notice of it, met them in the Court, where he receiv'd the Ambassadors very civilly,
and conducted them to a Chamber richly hung. There were with them the Poslanick, Alexei,
and a Tartar Ambassador of Chrim. The Collation was Magnificent, and of the noblest fruits
in the Countrey, in great plenty. Our drink was Wine, Beer, Hydromel, and Aquavitae, of
all enough: the Trumpets, which the Weywode had lent him, sounding in the mean time, and
other Musick playing. When he drunk the Great Duke's and his Highness our Master's health,
he stood, and presented the Cup with his own hand, to all the retinue, even to the Pages. Alexei
in the mean time told us Miracles of the birth and noble endowments of Mussal, endeavouring
to perswade us, that he was not to be ranked among the other Myrses, or Princes of
Tartary, but that he was to be consider'd as a very great Prince, and Nephew to Knez Iuan
Borissouits Circaski, being his brother's son, one of the greatest Lords of the great Duke's
Court. He told us, that, when he did homage, the Czaar had done him very particular favours,
and made him considerable Presents: that he had a Brother at Court, a great Favorite:

that his Sister was to marry the King of Persia,1636. and that he might serve us in both
Kingdoms.
               
                   This Entertainment took us up several hours,The incivility of the Muscovites. after which the Ambassadors would have gone
to see the Habitations of the Tartars, without the City; but the Muscovites very barbarously
shut the Gates against them, which oblig'd us to return to the ship.
               The 24. The Poslanick, Alexei, gave the Ambassadors a Visit, upon his own accompt. He
was kindly receiv'd, and after he had been Magnificently treated at Dinner, we sent him back to
his Lodging, attended by twelve persons of our retinue, who had each of them a Sable skin.
This Muscovite, who might be about 50. years of age, was an ingenious man, and had a great
inclination to Learning, contrary to the ordinary humour of those of his Nation. He had learnt
some few Latine words, and was a Lover of the Mathematicks, whence it came that he Courted
our Conversation, in order to the advancement of his studies. He was so sedulous, that in the
space of five moneths, that we were in company together, both in Persia and by the way, he
made such a Progress therein, that he could express himself well enough to be understood in Latine.
'Tis true, 'twas not with the Congruity requisite, but what he had was very extraordinary
in a Muscovite. He learnt also the use of the Astrolabe, as well to take the height of the Sun,
and find out the time of the day, as to make use of it in Geometry. He had one made by our
Clock maker; and as soon as he came to any City or Village, he went out into the Street, to
take the Elevation of the Pole; which the Muscovites, not accustom'd to see their Countrey-men
employ'd in those exercises, thought very strange.
               The 25.The Cuptzi's Feasts. The Cuptzi sent to invite the Ambassadors to a feast the next day, and desir'd them
to send him the name and titles of his Highness, our Master, as also the names and qualities of
the Ambassadors, that he might send them by an express to the Chan, or Governour of Schamachie
in Media, that when we came to the Frontiers of Persia, we might find all things ready
for the prosecution of our Voyage.
               The 26. He sent seven Horses to the River-side for the Ambassadors and their retinue, but
they made use only of two, and, causing the rest to be led, they ordered the Gentlemen and
Officers to walk a foot, according to the custom in Germany. He had prepar'd the Feast in a
great house, which, to that end, he had borrow'd of the Weywode, and over against it, he had
hir'd another Lodging, where he had erected a Theater cover'd with Persian Tapistry, for the
Timbrels and Hawboyes, who continu'd their Musick from our arrival to our departure.
               The house where the Feast was kept, was all cover'd with Turkish and Persian Tapistry.
The Cuptzi met the Ambassadors in the Court, receiv'd them with great civility, and conducted
them through two Chambers hung all about, into a third, which was hung with Gold and Silver
Brocadoe.
               In all the Chambers, there were Tables and Seats cover'd with the best Persian Tapistry,
which the Cuptzi had done purposely for our convenience, knowing we were not yet accustomed
to the mode of Persia, where they sit upon the ground to eat. The Tables were loaden with all
sorts of Fruits and Preserves, as Grapes, Apples, Melons, Peaches, Apricocks, Almonds, Raisins
of the Sun, whereof some were little and without stones, Kernels of Nuts, Pistachoes, and
several Indian fruits, preserv'd in Sugar and Honey, and over them were large pieces of Satin
or Taffata.
               We were hardly set, ere came in the two Ambassadors of Persia and Poland, who had upon
their ordinary Habits, the Vestiments which the King of Persia had presented them with, and
the Iacobin Frier had a Golden Cross upon his breast as well as the Armenian Bishop. They
took their places next the Ambassadors, and being well skill'd in the Latine, Spanish, Italian,
and French Languages, their discourses were accordingly without any trouble, and full of diversion.
               'Tis the custome of Persia to begin their Feasts with Fruits and Preserves. We spent two
hours in eating only those, and drinking Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae. Then was brought up
the meat in great Silver Dishes. They were full of Rice of divers colours, and, upon that, several
sorts of Meat boil'd and roasted, as Beef, Mutton, tame Fowl, wild Ducks, Fish and other
things, all very well ordered, and very delicate.
               The Persians use no knives at Table, but the Cooks send up the meat ready cut into little
bits; so that it was no trouble to us to accustome our selves to their manner of eating. Rice
serves them instead of bread. They take a mouthfull of it, with the two fore-fingers, and the
thumb, and so put it into their mouths. Every Table had a Carver, whom they call Suffretzi,
who takes the meat brought up in the great Dishes, to put it into lesser ones, which he fills with
three or four sors of meat, so as that every Dish may serve two, or, at most, three persons.
There was but little drunk till towards the end of the repast, and then the Cups went about
roundly, and the Dinner was concluded with a Vessel of Porcelane, full of a hot blackish kind of
drink, which they call Kahawa, whereof we shall have occasion to say more hereafter.
               The Persians express'd their civility towards us so highly, both in word and deed, at this
 we could not have desir'd more in our own Country. Having taken leave both of

our Entertainer, the Ambassadors of Persia and Poland, and the rest of the Company, which
was done with much honour and civility on all sides, we drew off with the noise of the Timbrels
and Haboyes, which sounded a retreat, after a very pleasant manner. Two of the most
considerable of the Company brought us to the City Gate, where they renew'd their civilities,
and acknowledg'd the honour the Ambassadors had done them, and re-assur'd us of their friendship
and services. As the Ambassadors went into the Shallop, some of the Ship Guns were fired,
which had also been done when they went out of it to go to the Feast.
               The 27. the Ambassadors, with some few persons about them, took a walk, and having
gone about the City, they went a league farther to see the habitations of the Tartars. We
found by the way, that, in those parts, Oxen and Horses tread out the Corn, whereas in other
places it is thrash'd; whereby we explain'd that Law, which forbids muzzling the Oxe
that treadeth out the Corn. No Hut but had its Hawk or Faulcon; in our return we met with
one of their Princes coming from his sport,The Tartars much given to Hawking. having his Hawk on his fist, and a Sheep-skin on
his back, as all the rest had. He exprest his trouble that he had not been at home to entertain the
Ambassadors.
               The same day went thence the Poslanick Alexei Sawinouits, continuing his Voyage to Persia
by the Caspian Sea.
               The 28.The Treatment of another Persian Merchant. The Ambassadors were treated with the same magnificence and ceremonies by the other
Persian Merchant, namely, Noureddin Mahumed, save that the Stage, or Theater, for
the Muscovians, was erected in the Court, opposite to the Table, but more richly adorn'd
than that of the Cuptzi. He had also invited the Religious Men before spoken of, certain Indians,
and two Muscovites, who came from the Weywode, and understood the Language. The
Ambassador Brugman being engag'd in discourse with them,Brugmans nprudence. broke out into very injurious expressions
against the Turks, who, though enemies to the Persians, yet were not then in any hostility
against the Muscovites: whereupon the former fearing it might reflect on them, as being
the Masters of the Entertainment, entreated the Ambassador not to engage into any further
discourse concerning publike Affairs, but to be merry, and to assure himself, that the expressions
they then made us of their affection, were but slight earnests of the friendship we were to
expect from them after our arrival into Persia.
               The 29.Another Tartar-Prince visits the Ambassadors. The Weywodes Present. we were visited by the Myrsa, or Tartar-Prince, whom we had met two days before
returning from his sport. He made us a present of some wild Geese, which he had taken,
and invited us to go along with him a-Hawking the next day, which we had accepted, but the
Weywode would not permit it, as we said before.
               Septemb. the last, the Weywode sent us a Present of some of the Country Preserves; to wit,
Ginger-bread, and the juyce of Goosberies reduc'd to a Past, whereof some was dispos'd into
the form of great Cheeses, some flat, and some in Rolls. It was, in taste, somewhat sharp
and picquant, and not unpleasant. The Muscovites put of this kind of paste into most of their
sawces.
               October the first,OCTOB. the Secretary of the Embassy, with two other Officers of the retinue, were
ordered to go to the Weywode about some business. He receiv'd me with much civility, made
me set down by him, and gave me a very favourable audience. But before he answer'd the
Proposions we had made to him, he made great complaint of the unhandsome treatment, which
Rodivon, our Pristaf, whom the Great Duke had order'd to conduct us as far as Astrachan,
had received from the Ambassador Brugman. He had given him very uncivil language, and had
call'd him Bledinsin, Sabak, &c. never considering that he was employ'd by the Great Duke.
He told us further, that, to his knowledge, the Pristaf was a person of honour, and prudent
in the management of his charge: but that it was a great indiscretion in the Ambassador to
treat him after that rate, though Rodivon had not done his duty, and that he should rather
have made his complaints of him to his Czaarick Majesty, or at least to those who represent the
Prince's Person at Astrachan, of whom he might have expected satisfaction: That he could
not believe the Duke of Holstein would take it well, no more than the Great Duke, that any
publick Officer of his Country should be treated in that manner: That he was oblig'd by the
concernment of his charge to make those remonstrances to us, but, that there was not, on the
other side, any reason the whole retinue should suffer for his mis-carriage, and that
that should not hinder him from giving us a speedy dispatch; as indeed he immediately
did.
               The dayes following were spent in carrying aboard the Provisions which we had bought,Provisions for the continuation of the Voyage. for
the prosecution of our Voyage. Our own people had bak'd Bread and Bisket, and had brew'd
a certain quantity of Beer. We had bought of the Tartars twenty fat Oxen, at between eight
and fourteen Crowns a piece, as also several Barrels of Salt-fish, intending to go to Sea with the
first opportunity. And in regard we knew not what kind of sayling it was on the Caspian Sea,
and that it was represented to us as very dangerous, by reason of the shallowness of the Wolga
thereabouts, for several leagues together, besides our Muscovian Pilot, we hired certain Tartars
of the Country, who promis'd to go before us in a Boat, and to bring our ship into the main Sea.
               
                  
Accordingly, Oct. 10. we left Astrachan,The Ambassadors leave Astrachan. about noon, having very fair weather, taking our
course towards South, and South-west. But we had not got a league, ere a contrary wind
rising forc'd us to the shore, and kept us there all that day, and the next. We there receiv'd
the visit of a certain Myrsa, or Tartar-Prince, a very handsome graceful person, and one of
the most considerable in those parts, who presented us with a Mutton, and a Barrel of Milk.
               We observ'd that near Astrachan, and for the most part all along the River Wolga, the
Earth produc'd Simples in great abundance,Simples of extraordinary bigness. and of incredible bigness. The Herb, which
the Latins call Esula, grew there as high as a Man, and the Root of Angelica was as big as a
Man's arm.
               The Tempest being over, the 12. we set forward, but could get but a league that day. We
got not much more the 13. and were forc'd to cast Anchor near a little round Mountain, on our
left hand, 15. werstes from Astrachan.
               The Muscovites call this mountain Tomanoi-gor. We gave it the name of the Snakie Mountain,Snakes.
by reason of the abundance of Serpents we met with there. It was full of Caper-trees,
and had abundance of the Herb called Semper-vivum, of several kinds, as Sea-house-leek, Prickmadame,
&c. The Plain, which is at the foot of this Hill, affords one of the most delightful
Prospects of the World, and that for several leagues together. At night, we saw in a Boat the
Strelits who had convoy'd the Poslanick, as far as Terki. They told us there was no danger
in our way, and that they had come it in 24. hours.
               The 14. the wind North-north-east, we continu'd our Voyage, and came in the afternoon
over against a Chapel called Zuantzuk, 30. werstes from Astrachan. Hereabouts is the best
fishing in the Country; The Tartars call it Vtschu, and it belongs to the Convent of Troitza,
or of the Trinity, at Astrachan. The River Wolga, in this place, divided into several Chanels,
making so many Isles, which are covered all over with Bushes, Canes, and Ozier, as is
also the Coast of the Caspian Sea, as far as the River Koisu. There is, among the rest, one Isle
named Perul, 15. werstes from Vtschu, in which we saw a house built of wood, of a considerable
height: having on the roof of it a long pole with a Sheep's skull at the top of it, and we
were told it was the Sepulchre of a Tartarian Saint, near which the Inhabitants, as also some
among the Persians, when they either take a Voyage, or are safely return'd home, sacrifice a
Sheep, part whereof serves for the Sacrifice, the rest for a Feast after the Sacrifice. Having
ended their Prayers and Devotions, the Sheep's head is put on the top of the pole, where it is left,
till it be either reliev'd by another, or fall off of it self. The Muscovites call this place Tataski
Molobitza, that is to say, The Sacrifice of the Tartars. Behind this Isle, on the left hand,
there were, upon a high, but very smooth ascent, a great number of Hutts.
               At night we came to another Fishing-place, 15. werstes from the Sea, where the River is
shut in with a Palizadoe, and kept by a hundred Muscovian Musketiers, who keep a guard there
against the Cosaque Pirates. In this place we saw a great number of Dog-fishes, or Sea-hounds,
as also of that kind of Fowl which Pliny calls Onocratalus, whose Beaks are long, round, and
flat at the extremity, as a Spoon beaten out. Putting its Beak into the water, it makes a noise
not much unlike that of an Ass, whence it hath the name: but particularly we took notice of a
kind of Geese, or rather Cormorants, whereof we made mention before. The Muscovites
call them Babbes, the Persians, Kuthum, and the Moores of Guiny, Bombu. As to their feet,
leggs, neck, and colour, they are like other Geese, but they are bigger in body than Swans.
Their Bills are above a foot and a half long, and two fingers broad, and forked at the end.
Under their Bills, they have a great bag of shrivell'd skin, which they can dilate so, as that it
is able to contain near three Gallons of liquor, and they make use of it as a reservatory for the
fish they take, till such time as they can swallow them down. For their throats are so wide,
that people are not only oblig'd to shut them, when they make use of these Birds in fishing, as
they often do, but also, if we believe Franciscus Sanctius, it was discover'd, that one of these
Birds, which was taken upon its having overcharg'd the said bag, had swallow'd down a Moor-child
upon the Coasts of Africk. The Persians are very expert in dressing the skins of them,
and making Tabours thereof, or covering therewith some other Musical Instruments. The Ambassador
Crusius kill'd one of them upon the Caspian Sea side, which was above two ells and a
half between the extremities of the Wings, and above seven foot from the head to the feet.
Franciscus Fernandez, in his History of the living-Creatures and Plants of Mexico, sayes, that,
in those parts, there are some that have teeth within their Bills; but we are not to go out of
Africa into America.
               We saw hereabouts another kind of Bird, much after the form of wild Ducks, save that they
are somewhat bigger, and black as Crows, and have longer necks, and the end of their bills
forked. The Muscovites call them Baclan, and they are seen only in the night time; their quills
are harder and bigger than those of Crows, and very fit for designers.
               The 15. we came to the mouth of the River Wolga, and the entrance into the Caspian Sea,
which is 12. leagues from Astrachan, and full of small Islands, covered th Reeds & Canes till a
man comes six leagues within the Sea. Some attribute to the Wolga as many mouths as there

are Islands thereabouts; but they are mistaken, for those Islands are to be accompted rather
made by the Sea, than the River.
               The bottome is all muddy, having but between four, or four foot and a half water, which
put us to inexpressible trouble, and took up our time so, as that we hardly got four leagues in
seven dayes. Our worst dayes were the 18. and 19. of October. The 18. we were got on a
Bank, at five foot water, and having spent as many hours in getting off, we found indeed six
foot water, but soon discover'd that it was only a pit, which of all sides, had Banks, at four and
four foot and a half water.
               Having, with no less trouble, got again to the Bank where we had five foot water, the wind
being turn'd to the North-west, the water fell so sensibly, that we had but three foot, the
Ship being as it were fasten'd in the mud. We unloaded part of our Provisions into the Tartarian
Boat that went before us, and set all our people on work, to get off; but though they
took incredible pains, so as that they had not the leasure either to eat or drink, yet could they
do no good, so that all could be done was patiently to expect the return of the water, which
we could not hope for but with the change of the wind. This was no small affliction to those,
who consider'd that we were there at the mercy of the Cosaques, who might easily have taken us
prisoners, and forc'd us to ransome our selves. With all these misfortunes there happen'd to be
such a thick mist, that we could not see from one end of the Ship to the other, and occasion'd a
great oversight in us, by firing a great Gun, according to the order of the Ambassador Brugman,
at a Muscovian Boat that pass'd somewhat near our Ship: Those who were in the Boat return'd
us their curses, and told us, that they might as freely pass that way, as we, who were Strangers,
and went by the Great Duke's permission, whom we were oblig'd to acknowledge for Soveraign
of that Sea, and their Prince; that since we were so much given to shooting, we might
keep our powder to be us'd against the Cosaques, who not far thence expected us. This reproach
caus'd two other Boats to fare the better, and our selves also, for, instead of injurious
speeches, they sent us some of the fruits of Circassia, to wit, an excellent kind of Pears,
Nuts, and Medlars.
               Oct. 21. at night, we first perceiv'd that the water was risen to five foot, which begat in us a
hope, that we might put off to Sea. The Tempest, which rose the 22. with a South-south-eastwind,
brought it up to nine foot; but it was so violent, that not daring to make use of our
Sails, we were forc'd to continue still at Anchor, and expect fairer weather, which came not till
five dayes after.
               The 23. in the morning, the sky being clear, I observ'd the Sun at its rising, and found, that,
in respect of the Compass, it rose 22. degrees more towards the South than it should, by which
means we discover'd, that, in that place, the needle declin'd 22. degrees from the North, towards
the West.
               The 27. the Tempest being over, we return'd all our things into the Ship, and dismiss'd our
Boat, and, having hoised Sail, got into the Sea; but we hardly made a league, ere we were
again in the mud, and oblig'd to send for the Boat. But perceiving we had water enough, the
28. and seeing thirteen Sail behind us coming out of the Wolga, whom we conceiv'd to be the
Caravan, we order'd the Boat to be sent back. It was the Tartar-Prince, two Merchants of
Persia, and five hundred Muscovian Musketiers, with their Colonel, who were going to relieve
the Garrison of Terki: but what put us most to a loss, was, that, finding the Muscovian Pilot,
whom we had taken up at Astrachan, absolutely ignorant in the business of Navigation; and
the Maps, by which we intended to direct our course, absolutely false, we knew not what resolution
to take.
               We resolv'd at last to address our selves to the Officer that commanded the 500. Musketiers,
and to send to him in the evening, while all the ships lay at Anchor, to entreat his assistance and
advice in that conjuncture, and to desire him to give us an able man that might be our Pilot on
the Caspian Sea. He came aboard us, and having drunk sufficiently, he made us the greatest
protestations of friendship in the World, and told us, that the trouble it was to him to see us
in those difficulties had bereft him of his sleep; that his joy to find us in good health was so
much the more extraordinary, and that he would not fail to send the Weywode notice of it by an
express Messenger; that all under his Command were at our service, and that as soon as he were
got aboard,A Muscovian Slurr. he would send us a Pilot we might confide in. But the merry Companion was no
sooner got to his own ship, but he set sayl, and left us in the lurch. I think, what troubled
him was, that we had not made him some present according to the custom of the Countrey;
but he regarded so little the slur he had put upon the Ambassadors, that he had the impudence to
come and Visit them in their ship, in the company of several other Tartarian Lords, after our
arrival at Terki, and made no other answer to the reproaches he receiv'd upon that occasion, than,
ja wi nouat, a great business indeed to be talk'd of.
               Finding our selves thus abus'd,The civility of a Persian Pilot. we sent to the Master of the Persian ship, to entreat his assistance.
He, though Mas of the ship, and owner of all the goods in it, came aboard us, to proffer
us his service as a Pilot, with more kindness and civility than we could have expected from a

Christian, and, having recommended his own ship to his servants, stay'd with us. He was a
very understanding man, and was not only acquainted with the Navigation of those parts, but
also with the Compass, much beyond what the Persians ordinarily are vers'd in, who do not
willingly venture very far into the Sea, but for the most part keep in sight of Land. So that
finding the wind serv'd,An ominous day. he caus'd the Anchor to be weigh'd, about eleven at night, taking his
course towards the South, with an East wind. We observ'd it was the same day that we left
Travemunde the year before, and accordingly we had the same success in this second Voyage.
We had all that night but ten foot water; but towards day, we had eighteen. The Countrey
on our right hand, which is called Suchator, had four Hills, which made a great Promontory,
reaching a great way into the Sea; and from that Cape to Astrachan are counted 100 werstes,
and to Terki 200. but on both sides they are very short ones.
               The 29. The weather fair, we kept on our course, in the morning Southward, and with a
South-East wind, and in the afternoon, South-west-ward, having about twenty foot water,
and finding the bottom gravelly, and full of little shells. We could discover no Land that day,
and the night following, we cast Anchor. Here the Needle declin'd twenty degrees, from North
to West.
               Octob. 30. We set sayl at the break of day, and soon after Sun-rising, we discover'd the
Countrey of Circassia, which lies all along the Sea-Coast from the South-West, to
North-East, compassing it about, much after the form of a Crescent, and making a spacious
Bay.
               It was our design, to get beyond the point of the Gulf, but the wind coming to South-East,
had almost forc'd us into it, which oblig'd us to cast Anchor about noon, at the entrance of the
Gulf, at three fathom and a half water, finding at the bottom a kind of fat earth, about six
Leagues from Terki. We discover'd in the Bay, about 20. or twenty five Boats, and upon the
first sight thereof, it run into our imagination, that they were the Cosaques; but we were soon
undeceiv'd, and found them to be Tartarian Fisher-men, belonging to Terki, and were then
coming to bring us fish to sell. For those we bought of them, we gave them fifteen pence a
piece, but they were very great ones, and we found in their bellies a great number of Crabs and
Lobsters, among which there were some alive.
               The remainder of the day we spent in giving Almighty God solemn thanks, for all his mercifull
deliverances of us, particularly that which happen'd on the very same day the year before,
when we were in so great danger, amidst the Rocks and Shelves of Ocland. Our Persian Pilot
went that day to his own ship, which was at some distance behind us, to give his men Order
what they should do, leaving us somewhat of an opinion, that he would shew us such another
trirk as the Muscovite had done before: but he afterwards made it appear, that those
of his Nation are not only made up of Complements, for he return'd very betimes the next
morning, having sent his Boat before us, to serve us for a Guide.
               The last day of October, we had, in the morning, a thick Mist, with a great Calm. The Sun
having dispell'd the one about noon, and the wind being come to the North, we endeavour'd to
get out of the Gulf, and with much ado, by laveering, got the point, near which we stayd at
Anchor till after midnight, and came very betimes in the morning,NOVEM??? on the first of November,
before the City of Terki. We cast Anchor about a quarter of a League from the City, because
we could not come any nearer, by reason of the shallowness of the water. The night before,
the Cosaques had a design to set upon us, but happily miss'd us in the dark, and met with the
little Fleet which brought the Tartar-Prince; but the noise of the Strelits or Muscovian Muskettiers
having discover'd to them that they were mistaken, and imagining they should find a vigorous
resistance, they drew back, but made it appear they were the Germans that they look'd
for.
               Intelligence coming, in the morning, to the City, of this attempt of the Cosaques, rais'd a verry
hot Alarm there, in regard it was known that Mussal their Prince was coming, and that he
might be in some danger. The Inhabitants were confirm'd in that opinion, when they heard the
going off of our great Guns, a noise they are not accustomed to in those parts; insomuch that
they began to get together, and look on us as Enemies; but they were put out of all fear by
the arrival of their Prince, who having given us a Volley as he pass'd by, and invited us to honour
him with a Visit at his Mother's, satisfy'd the Inhabitants, that there was no danger either
to him or them.
               The City of Terki lies somewhat above half a League from the Sea,Terki described. upon the little River Timenski,
which issues out of the great River Bustro and facilitates the correspondence there is between
the Sea and the City, to which there is is no other way to come by reason of the Fens,
which encompass it on all sides, for a quarter of a League about. It is seated in a spacious plain,
which is of such extent, that the extremities thereof cannot be discover'd by the eye; whence
may be corrected the errour of the Map, drawn by Nicholas Iansson Piscator, alias Vischer,
though in all other things the best and most exact of any I could ever meet with, who places the
City of Terki upon a Mountain, but, by a mistake, confounding the City of Tarku in the Province

of Dagesthan, with that of Terki in Circassia. The Elevation of the Pole, is, here, at 43.
degrees, 23 minutes. It is distant from Astrachan sixty Leagues by Sea, and seventy by Land,
and is the last place under the Jurisdiction of the Great Duke of Muscovy. It is in length 2000.
foot; and in breadth 800. all built of Wood, even the Towers and Rampiers, yet very well furnish'd
with great Guns, among which there were then two battering Pieces, plac'd upon Carriages,
before the Governours house.
               The Great Duke hath lately caus'd it to be fortify'd after the modern way of Fortification,The Garrison of Terki.
with Rampiers and Bastions of earth, by a Dutch Engineer named Cornelius Nicholas, who went
Masters-mate along with us into Persia. The ordinary Garrison consists of two thousand men,
1500. whereof are under the Command of a Weywode, or Colonel, and divided into three Pricasses
or Regiments, each of 500. men. The Prince is assign'd the other 500. for his Guard,
and they are maintain'd upon the Great Duke's charge, but oblig'd to joyn with the others in
case of necessity. The Tartars of Circassia have their habitations on this side the River. We
shall speak of their Religion and manner of life hereafter, as having had more leasure at our return,
to make a more particular observation thereof.
               The next day after our arrival,The Cuptzi's Present to the Ambassadors. the Cuptzi and the other Persian Merchants sent a Present to
the Ambassadors, which consisted of excellent Fruits, in great abundance, as also to ask them,
whether they were resolv'd to prosecute their Voyage by Sea, or would travel by Land, with
this by way of Invitation, that if they would go by Land, there was an opportunity to do it
with all imaginable convenience, in as much as, within three dayes, there was expected at Terki
a Muscovian Ambassador, who was upon his return from Persia, and would bring with
him to the Frontiers, two hundred Camels, and a great number of Mules, which might carry
our baggage. To this, it was added, that, by this convenience, we might pass safely through
the Countrey of the Tartars of Dagesthan, and avoid falling into the hands of their Schemkal,
or Captain, who was one of the greatest Robbers in the World; and that we might be the further
assur'd there was no danger, they proffer'd us their company in our Travels. This proposal
was so well receiv'd by the Ambassadors, that they immediately sent to the Weywode to desire
his permission to take their advantage of this opportunity, and dispatch'd Rustan, our Persian
Interpreter, to the Frontiers of Dagesthan, six Leagues from Terki, to take order for the
prosecution of our Voyage by Land; but being come thither, he found the Camels, and all the
other beasts fit for carriage, were return'd into Persia.
               The Weywode had at first absolutely deny'd us the Liberty of passage; but as soon as he heard
there was no convenience of taking that way, he sent an Officer to tell us, that, though he had
receiv'd no express order from the Great Duke to permit any such thing, yet he would not stick
to grant us passage, and assist us in order thereto what lay in his power.
               The night following,A mutiny in the ship. the Mariners, belonging to our ship, fell into a mutiny, against Michael
Cordes, our Captain, and the noise was so great, that many of them were put into Irons.
The next day, an enquiry was made into the disorder that had been committed in the night,
and Anthony Manson, a Sayl-maker, being found the most guilty of any, he was condemn'd
to remain a Prisoner at Terki, till our return out of Persia. The Weywode sent for him, by two
of his Officers, at the entreaty of the Ambassadors. One of those Officers had a Coat of Mail
under his Casaque, and a tin Gantelet; the other, who by his quality was a Knez; had a Garment
of Crimson Velvet.
               Nov. 4. Our Musick play'd in the morning betimes, it being the birth day of the Ambassador
Brugman; which ended, the great Guns were discharg'd. The same morning, the Tartar
Prince's Mother sent one to complement the Ambassadors, and to give them thanks for their
respects and civilities towards her son in his Voyage, entreating them to honour her with a Visit
at her house,An Eunuch belonging to the King of Persia visits the Ambassador. and to come and receive her Benediction. In the afternoon, we were Visited,
aboard, by a Persian Lord, who had a retinue of many servants. He was an Eunuch, and the
King of Persia had sent him express, to bring along with him the Tartar Prince's sister, to whom
he was to be married. He made extraordinary proffers of friendship to the Ambassadors, and
was so well pleas'd with our drink, that he grew perfectly drunk, in so much that he knew not
which way to get out of the ship. They that came along with him were so edify'd by his example,
that one of them was so loaden, that we were forc'd to let him down by a rope into the
Shallop.
               The 5. The Ambassador sent M. Mandelslo, the Pastor and Secretary of the Embassy, accompany'd
by our Tartarian and Persian Interpreters, to the Weywode,Their Presents to the Weywode. to Present him a large
Vermilion-guilt-cup, and the two Chancellors or Secretaries each of them with a Ruby. They
were also ordered to go and wait upon the Tartar-Prince's Mother, and to complement her upon
the safe return of her Son. We were very kindly receiv'd in all places, and treated with
Collations of Fruit, Beer, Hydromel, Aquavitae, and Wine. The Weywode entertain'd us
with the same magnificence as that of Nisenovogorod, and falling into discourse of the nature
and manner of life of the Persians, he told us, that they would, no doubt, be
extremely liberal of their good words and fair promises, but that it requires a strong

faith to believe one half of them, in as much as their performance would not be consonant
thereto.
               Prince Mussal receiv'd us in Person,Their message to the Tartar-Prince. with very intimate demonstrations of affection, at the
entrance of the Court, and conducted us into a high and spacious Hall, whereof the Walls were
of earth, and so built, that a man might see on all sides, at an equal distance, a certain number
of Neeches vaulted, in which there were either rich beds, with coverlets of silk or cotton;
or there were layd up in them several pieces of Persian Tapestry, and coverlets;
wrought or embroider'd with gold and silk, of divers several colours, with great chests covered
with the same.
               All along the wall, just under the seeling, there hung two rows of dishes, of wood and earth,
of diverse colours; and the pillars, which underpropp'd the structure, were hung all about
with excellent Cymitars, Quivers, and Arrows. The Princess sat in a chair, having about her a
black loose Gown lin'd with Sables, and made after the fashion of a morning-coat.
               The Princess's name was Bika,The reception of the Envoys from the Ambassadors by th Tartar-Princess. and she was of a very noble stature, and had a good countenance,
and might be about 45 years of age. She wore, at her neck behind, an Ox-bladder, blown
to the utmost, which was wound about towards her hair, with a rich Scarf embroider'd with
Gold and Silk, and had about her neck another Scarf, the two ends whereof hung down over
her shoulders. Behind the Chair stood a Lady, who had also a Bladder at her neck, and we
were told afterwards that it was the Badge of Widdowhood. On her right hand stood her
three Sons, the two younger whereof were no better in Cloaths than the most inconsiderable persons
in the Country. Behind them, stood certain Servants, on whose fore-heads and faces
(which they had torn with their nails) might still be seen the marks of their mourning for the
death of the elder brother, who had been executed at Moscou. On the left hand stood, all in
a file, several Tartars, who were all very aged Persons, and represented the Council and Officers
of the Court. The Princess, having answer'd our Complement, ordered Seats to be
brought; and a little Table furnish'd with Fruits for the Collation,The Collation. at which our drink was Hydromel
and Aquavitae. We would have had the Princes to have sate down with us, but they
would not by any means do it, alledging, that it was not the Custome of the Country, and
that the respect they ought their Mother permitted not their sitting down in her presence.
               The Collation being ended,The curiosity of the Tartar-Ladies. and the Princess and others of the Company having handled and
taken particular notice of our Cloaths all over, the Princess her self presented to each of us, a
large Cup, full of a sort of Aquavitae extracted out of a Millet, which we found as strong as
Spirit of Wine. The three Princes Presented us also with each of them a Cup, and intreated us
not to take it ill, if they did the same honour to our Servants. In the mean time there was opened,
behind the Princess, a Chamber-door, at the entrance whereof were to be seen several
Ladies, and amongst the rest the Princess's Daughter, who was betroathed to the Sophy of
Persia.
               She might be about sixteen years of age, and was very handsome, the clearness of her complexion
having so much the greater lustre, by reason of the extraordinary blackness of her hair.
These Ladies seemed to be no less desirous to see our Cloaths, than those who were in the Hall,
thrusting one another towards the door, which they immediately shut upon the least sign made
to them by the Princess: but they opened it again soon after, to take a further view of us. They
call'd one of our servants to them, to take the more particular notice of his Cloaths, the fashion
whereof they very much admir'd, as also that of his Sword, which they desir'd him to draw,
that they might see the blade of it. But the Persian Envoy, who every day visited the Princess,
coming into the Room while they were so employ'd, the Chamber door was immediately shut
upon them, and we took leave of the Princess and the Princes her Sons, and went to view the City.
We there met with several Women, handsome, young, and well made, having on them a
kind of smocks of frocks of diverse colours, who made no difficulty ever and anon to stay us,
till they had taken particular notice of our Cloaths.
               Nov. 6. The Cuptzi sent us a Letter from the Governour of Derbent, in answer to that which
he had writ to him from Astrachan, the 25 of Sept. before. The contents of it was, to express
his joy at our arrival, and to order the Cuptzi not to come away without us, but to bring us along
with him by Sea.
               The 7. Our Interpreter Rustan return'd from the frontiers of Dagesthan, with this news,
that those, who had conducted the Muscovian Ambassador to the frontiers, were return'd into
Persia before his coming thither; and that they thought it not enough to carry away the Camels
and all the other Beasts fit for carriage, but they had also taken along with them the pieces
of Timber and Fagots, without which it was impossible to get over those places where the Road
was bad: upon which intelligence it was immediately resolv'd, that we should continue our
Voyage by Sea.
               The 8. The Princess sent the Ambassadors a present of two Sheep, fifty Pullets, and several
other Provisions. The high Chancellor of Muscovy sent us a Sheep, a barrel of Beer, and aanother

of Hydromel. In the afternoon, the Prince Mussal came to give us a visit, to bid us
adieu. There came along with him a Myrsa of Dagesthan, a Brother of the Prince of Tarku's,
who made us believe, he was come expres to conduct the Ambassadors as far as the place of his
Brother's residence. He was no better clad than the other Tartars, having, over his old cloaths,
a Cloak, of a sort of very coarse Cloath, but as to his corntenance and behaviour, he express'd
a fierceness beyond any of them, not dissembling the trouble it was to him, that we discover'd
a greater respect for Mussal than for him, and refusing to stand at the drinking of the Great
Duke's health. And when Mussal intreated him to consider the place he was in, he confidently
made answer, that he knew not whether the Country he was then in, were the Great Duke's or
his own, and began to pick a quarrel with him, reproaching him, that, with all his gay
Cloaths, he was but a slave to the Muscovite, whereas himself, though but in raggs, was nevertheless
an absolute Prince; that acknowledg'd no other superiour than God: insomuch that
at last, not able to govern his passion, he absolutely refus'd to drink the Czaar's health in any
posture,The Tartars enclin'd to theft. and went his wayes. Some of his servants stole from our Minister, a silver Spoon and
a Knife, and cut off one of the sleeves of my Doublet; but they were forc'd to leave it behind
them, it being engag'd under some other Cloaths.
               Prince Mussal staid with the Ambassadors, and begg'd of them the pardon of the Mariner
whom we had sent Prisoner to Terki. The Ambassadors very freely satisfy'd his desire therein,
and so sent late that night, the Secretary of the Embassy and another Gentleman, to the Weywode,
to entreat him to return the Prisoner into our hands, and to desire justice of him against
the Muscovian Pilot, who had run away from us two dayes before. A good while after night
a Lacquey was sent after us,The Ambassadors leave Terki. to press our immediate return to the Ship, which was then ready
to set sayl, to make all the advantage they could of the Wind, which for some hours had blown
very fair. We had dispatch'd all our business, when the Lacquey came to us; but notwithstanding
all the expedition we could use, we found the Ship under sayl, but it was not long,
ere the Wind, turning to the direct contrary point, forc'd us to continue in the same
place.
               The Weywode in the mean time sent us his Present,The Weywode's Present. which consisted of a hundred pieces of hung
Beef, four tuns of Beer, a puncheon of French Wine, a tun of Hydromel, a puncheon of Vinegar,
two Sheep, four great Cakes of Ginger-bread, and several Loafs of other bread. There
was bestow'd among those that brought the Present, about 20. Crowns, and good store of Aquavitae,
insomuch that they went their way very well satisfy'd.
               Nov. 10. the Wind coming to South-west, we set sayl at the break of day, intending to take
the course of the City of Derbent, which is the nearest of any of that frontier. About noon,
we discover'd a Bark, which at first, took its course so as if it would have pass'd on the right
hand of us, then made as if she would come up streight to us, and not knowing well what resolution
to take, they ever and anon made more or less sayl; whereby perceiving that those
who were in it, were afraid of us, the Ambassador Brugman gave order that the Ship should
make streight towards the Bark, put the Soldiers in their stations, and commanded a certain
number of great Guns to be fir'd at randome, the more to frighten them. The poor people immediately
struck sayl, and came near us. They were Persians, Fruit-Merchants, and the Bark
was then loaden with Apples, Pears, Quinces, Nuts, and other Fruits. The Master of it, who
was Brother to our Pilot, seeing him among a sort of people such as he had never seen before,
and believing he was their Prisoner, began with horrid Cries and Lamentations to bewail his
Brother's misfortune, as also his own, which he expected to fall into, though he cry'd several
times to him, Korchma duschman lardekul, Fear not, they are friends, among whom I am with
my own consent. But the other would hear of no perswasion to the contrary, imagining, that
they forc'd him to speak to that purpose, and could not recover himself out of the fear he was
in, till his Brother had acquainted him with the occasion which had brought him to our Ship.
Then was it that he took the courage to come himself into our Ship, with a present of all sorts
of Autumn-fruits, whereof he also sold good store, so cheap, that a quarter of a hundred of very
great Apples came not to a penny. He was treated with Aquavitae, after which he return'd
to his Bark very well satisfied.
               Much about this time, we came near an Isle which the Muscovites call Tzetland,An Island in the Caspian Sea. and the
Persians, Tzenzeni, eight Leagues from Terki, on the left hand. There we cast Anchor, at
three fathom and a half water, and staid there four and twenty hours, according to the custom
of the Pesians. We had lying before us a Treatise written by George Dictander, (who had
Travell'd into Pesia in the year 1602. with an Ambassador sent thither by the Emperour Rodolph
11.) who, speaking of this Isle, sayes, that, being the only man left alive at his return,
and staid in that place by the cold, he had been forc'd to kill the Horses which the Sophy had
bestow'd on him, after he had consum'd all the other Provisions. Having at our coming thither,
four or five hours of day-light remaining, the Ambassadors thought it not amiss to go into the
Island, to see whether what they observ'd there, were consonant to what the other had written
thereof: But all we could meet with worth our Observation was, only three great poles fasten'd

together, and set up at one of the points of the Island, beset all about with Roots and Boughs,
to serve for a direction to the Mariners, and two great Ditches, wherein some time before fire
had been made. This, in all probability was done by the Cosaques, who make their frequent
retreats into that Island. It lies at forty three degrees, five minutes elevation, and reaches
in length from North-east to South-east, about three German Leagues. The soil is for the
most part sandy and barren, and towards the extremities, either cover'd with shells, or fenny;
and it is the only Island that is to be seen, as we goe to Kilan, West-ward of the ordinary
course.
               From this Island, there may be seen in the Continent, towards the South-west, such high
Mountains, that we took them at first for Clouds. Our people called them the Mountains of
Circassia; but the Muscovites, nay the Inhabitants of Circassia themselves, call it the Mountain
Salatto, and it is properly that Mountain which the Antients call Caucasus,Mount Caucasus. in the Province
of Colchis, which is the same that at this day is called Mengrelia;Mengrelia. and is so famous in
Antiquity, for the fabulous expedition of Iason for the Golden  Its height, which indeed
is extraordinary, in as much as it seems to extend it self to the Stars, hath furnish'd the
Poets with that fancy, that it was from this Mountain Prometheus stole fire from the Sun, to
communicate it to men. Quintus Curtius affirms, that it crosses all Asia. Certain indeed it
is, that the Mountains of Aratat and Taurus are so near, and do so as it were cloze with it,
that it seems to be but one continu'd Mountain, extending it self all through Asia, from Mengrelia,
as far as the Indies. From the Caspian Sea, towards the Euxine Sea, and Asia the lesser,
it is near fifty Leagues in breadth. But let us see what Quintus Curtius says of it, in the seventh
Book of his History, where he gives us this accompt of it. They reach, saith he, from
thence, towards Mount Caucasus. which divides Asia into two parts, and leaves the Cilician
Sea on the one-side, and on the other, the Caspian Sea, the River Araxes, and the Deserts of Scythia.
Mount Taurus, which is to be ranked in the second place for its height, is joyned to Caucasus,
and, beginning in Cappadocia, crosses Cilicia, and reathes as far as Ania. It is as it
were a continu'd concatenation of Mountains, out of which arise almost al the Rivers of Asia,
some whereof fall into the Red-sea, and others, into the Hyrcanian, or that of Pontus. The Army
pass'd the Caucasus in seventeen days, and came in sight of the Rock, which is ten Stadia
in compasse, and about four in height, where Prometheus was chained, if we may credit the
Poets.
               Mount Aratat,Mount Aratat. upon which Noah's Ark rested after the deluge, and which the Armenians
call Messina, the Persians, Agri, and the Arabians Subeilahn, is without comparison much
higher than the Caucasus, and is indeed but a great black Rock, without any Verdure, and cover'd
with Snow on the top, as well in Summer as Winter, by means whereof it is discover'd
fifteen Leagues into the Caspian Sea. The Armenians, and the Persians themselves, are of opinion,
that there are still upon the said Mountain some remainders of the Ark, but that time
hath so hardned them, that they seem absolutely petrify'd. At Schamachy in Media, we were
shewn a Cross of a black and hard Wood, which the Inhabitants affirmed to have been made of
the Wood of the Ark: and upon that account it was look'd upon as a most precious Relick, and,
as such, was wrapp'd in Crimson Taffata. The Mountain is now inaccessible, by reason of the
precipices whereby it is encompass'd of all sides.
               Imaniculi Sulthan, whom the Sophy sent Ambassador to the Duke of Holstein, our Master,
and whose Territories lye in those parts, in the Country of Karabah told us many very remarkable
particulars of it. These high Mountains are a great direction to those who have no Compass
to sail by in the Caspian Sea; in as much as changing their form according to the
several prospects they afford, the Pilots by that means easily discover whereabouts they
are.
               The 11. we continu'd our Voyage presently after Sun-rising, taking our course along the
Isle Southward. At the extremity of the Isle, there is a kind of Streight, near a Cape or Promontory
which comes out of the Continent into the Sea, much about the same place, where,
on the Isle side, a great Sand-bank advances it self toward the Land, and so makes but a narrow
passage. Which oblig'd us to cast Anchor, that we might have the more convenience of
Sounding, so to avoid the flats or shallows, which make Navigation very dangerous thereabouts.
We found, at first, but two fathom water, but soon after we were at six or seven fathom;
insomuch that the Wind becoming more favourable, we took our course South-South-west,
directly towards Derbent, along the shore, and in sight of it. After mid-night, the Wind being
not so much for us as before, we were forc'd to laveer it all the remainder of the Night;
but we advanc'd little or nothing; insomuch that a Tempest rising thereupon, we at last resolv'd
to cast Anchor, which we did, at twelve fathom water. We lay at Anchor all the 12th. till 9.
at night, and then the Wind coming to the North, we set sail with a favourable Wind, taking
our course to the South-South-east.
               About 11. the same night, we found between 20 and thirty fathom water, and an hour after,
no bottom,A Tempest. so that the wind being turn'd again to an absolute Tempest, we conceiv'd, that it

would be dangerous for us to bear much sail upon a Sea we were not acquainted with, and that
in the Night time, Whereupon having furl'd them up, we let the Ship go directly before the
wind, by which means we got two Leagues in less than an hour. We had, besides our double
Shallop, two other Boats, one whereof, which we had bought of the Muscovites, was only
for their convenience who sounded the depth of the Water, and the other serv'd for the unloading
of our Ship, which drew both of them after her. There were two Sea-men appointed for
the guiding of the Shallop, which, having in it only certain small Pieces, Bullets, Chains, Cables,
Pitch, and other things necessary for Navigation, was made so shallow, that being ever and
anon fill'd with water, the Sea-men, finding themselves no longer able to guide it, came aboard
the Ship, and fasten'd the Shallop to the stern. The other Boats were soon over-whelm'd with
water and lost. The Shallop held out a while, but at length follow'd the others, and this
prov'd the beginning of our wrack upon the Caspian Sea. Our Ship, which was built only of
Firr, and had been much endammag'd by the Sand-banks of the Wolga, bow'd under the high
and violent waves of that Sea, as if it had been a Snake, and open'd in so many places, that we
were forc'd to be alwayes at the Pump, and continually employ'd in emptying the water that
came in of all sides. Our Persian Pilot had not the least share of the common fear and distraction
we were all in, and no doubt wish'd himself in his own Ship, or nearer Land; in regard that
had we been cast away there, we had all inevitably perish'd.
               Nov. 13. at the break of day, we perceiv'd, that we had still kept in sight of Land, and we
particularly discovered the Mountain of Derbent, which, as we conceived, could not be above
ten Leagues distant from us. The Tempest abating a little of its Violence, we hois'd the mizen
Sail, and afterwards the main Sail, with a resolution to run the Ship strait a-ground. But having,
the Night before, taken our course too high, and the wind continuing still from the
North-west, we were forc'd to comply with it, and, to our no small regret, pass beyond the
City of Derbent, along the Persian Coast, which, in that place, reaches from North to South,
but so as that we could not find any Road or Haven, where we might save our selves; for as
much as there being only Rocks at the bottom for the space of six Leagues from the Land into
the Sea, it is impossible to make the Anchor take any hold. At last, about four, in the afternoon,
we cast Anchor, at four fathom water, before the Village of Niasebeth, which our Authors
call Nisavay, the bottom muddy; but we thought not our selves more safe at Anchor,
than when we were toss'd up and down in the main Sea. The waves were so violent by reason
of the extraordinary roughness of the Sea, that it was not long ere they broke the hindges of
the Rudder, which oblig'd us to take it quite off, and to fasten it with a Cable behind the Ship,
lest beating against the Castle it should have broke it all to pieces; the Water coming still into
the Ship so fast, that we were forc'd to spend the remainder of that day, and all the night following,
in emptying it.
               The Tempest abated a little of its violence the next morning, being the the 14. of November,
and invited us to think of some course for the disembarking of our selves, but we had neither
Boat nor Shallop to help us to Land, and though we had caus'd several Volleyes of great
and small shot to be discharg'd, to oblige the Inhabitants of the Countrey to come in to our relief,
yet could we not perceive any body; but we had hardly made a shift to clap a certain
number of deal Boards together like a flat-bottom'd Boat, ere we saw coming towards us
two Boats, which the Kaucha, or Judge of the Village, had sent to our relief in that extremity.
               They brought us a present, of two baggs of Apples, with a very obliging Complement,
protesting that they were no less glad at our arrival, than we might be at theirs. Which done,
they exhorted the Ambassadors to get out of the Ship as soon as they could possibly, taking
along with them what they accompted of greatest Value, and not to be over-confident of the
clam,The Ambassadors disembark with part of their retinue. which, no doubt, would not last many hours. The Ambassadors took their advice, and
having put into the Boats what they thought most considerable, they ordered some part of their
retinue to go in also, and certain Soldiers with their Officers; leaving in the ship the Sieur
Vchterits, their Steward, and the Secretary of the Embassy, with an intent to send for them as
soon as they were landed themselves.
               The Kaucha was on Horse-back at the Sea-side, and perceiving that the Boats could not come
near enough, by reason of the shallowness of the water, he alighted, and sent the Ambassadors
his Horse for their more convenient Landing. And thus it was that the Ambassadors first set
foot in Persia. But as soon as they were got a-shore, the Tempest grew more violent than it
had been before, insomuch that it was impossible for them to send back the Boats: which put
us that were left aboard to the utmost hazard of Shipwrack and Life. The Ship, being now in
a manner quite unloaden, was toss'd up and down like a Ball by the Waves, the Sea raising her,
one while, up to the Clouds, another swallowing her up in its abysses. There was constantly
above a foot water upon the Deck, so that we were not able to stay upon it; and at last the
Ship opening above, just in the middle, we began to fear the absolute dissolution of her. We
observ'd also by the Trees that were upon the Sea-side, that the Anchor was loose, and that

the wind had carry'd us above a quarter of a League from the place where he had disembarked
the Ambassadors, whereupon we cast two others, both which were lost about 11. the same
night, as also our Rudder. The biggest Anchor held still, but the Vessel drew so much water,
that the Pump being of no further use, we were forc'd to empty her with Kettles. About midnight
the wind came to the East, and broke off our main and mizen Masts, and over-turn'd them
into the Sea, the Ship shaking in that interim with so much violence, that the edges of her
were ever and anon even with the water. The Sea-men intreated the Secretary, to give them
leave to cut the Ropes that still held her, to see if that would deliver us out of the extremity we
were in; which he made no difficulty to grant them. We had not eaten ought in three
dayes, and watching, with continual labour, had brought us so low, that having lost all courage,
together with the hope of ever saving our Lives, all our thoughts were taken up with the
disposal of our selves for Death. Our Carpenter was the only person who had the courage to
go under Decks, and to take so large a dose of Aquavitae, that being come up on the Deck, he
fell down dead at our feet. Nor indeed could we have imagin'd him to be otherwise, if the Exhaltations
of the Aquavitae, that ascended from his stomach, had not discover'd the nature of his
indisposition.A strange resolution in the utmost hazard. The Sea-men remitted nothing of their labour all this time, and exhorted the
rest to be of good courage, putting us in hope, that, within some few hours, either the weather
would change, or the Ambassadors would not fail to relieve us, as indeed they were both of
them earnest to do all lay in their power for our preservation. Nay the Ambassador Brugman
would, with his Sword drawn, have forc'd some of our people to come in the two Boats to
look after us, but he could by no means prevail with them, to hazard themselves.
               Perceiving the day slipp'd away without any hope of relief, and fearing the Tempest might
grow more violent the night following, I took the Master's-mate aside, and was desirous to
know of him, whether, the Tempest continuing in the height it was then at, it would not be
our best course to run the Ship a-ground to save the men. His answer was, that he believ'd the
Ship could not make any great resistance, and that it were not amiss I took the advice of the
other Officers, and propose it to the Captain and the Master, who both confess'd, that the ship
was in so ill a plight, that they were confident the Ambassador Brugman himself would have
commanded her to be run a-ground, had he been among them: and yet they were withall of
opinion, that, continuing their labour for some hours longer, it was not impossible but the
Vessel might be saved. But they discover'd by their discourse their main fear to be, that, when
there were no ship, they would be look'd on as useless persons, and that there might be some
dispute about their wages for the rest of the Voyage. Hence it came that they were unwilling
the ship should be run a-ground. But the Sieur Vchterits and the Secretary, overcome with the
importunities of the rest of the company to have that course taken, in so great an extremity,
the Captain and Masters-mate at last gave their consent, provided a promise were made them
in Writing, that the Ambassadors should not call them to an accompt for their so doing: which
was accordingly done, and the Secretary drew up an Act to that purpose, which was signed by
all. But the Captain and Master beginning to make new difficulties, after they had gotten a
discharge, as aforesaid, all our people would have mutini'd, and cry'd out, that if they delay'd
the running of the ship a-ground any longer, they should answer before the Tribunal of God,
to give an accompt for what should happen thereupon. The Captain would have excus'd himself,
alleging, that though the ship were run a-ground, as was desired, yet were it impossible
for him to save all our people: but answer was made him, that they were resolv'd to run the
hazard of it, and he was so earnestly press'd thereto, that he consented, after he had obliged
the Sieur Vchterits and the Secretary of the Embassy to give the first stroak upon the Cable:
which when they had done,The Ship runs a-ground. the Sea-men soon made an end, and having struck the only sayl we
had left us, we made strait to land, and run the ship a-ground, about thirty pearches distant
from the place where the Ambassadors and all our friends expected us, with no less trouble for
us, than we had for our selves. Nay some of them, to make a greater expression of their affection,
came a good way into the water, and carry'd us ashore.
               It prov'd no great trouble to us to justifie the resolution we had taken of running the Ship a-ground,
in regard that, as to that particular, the Ambassador Brugman himself prevented us,
and told us he had been long before resolv'd to send the Captain orders to do it, but that he
could not meet with any person that would undertake the execution thereof.
               As concerning the Caspian Sea,A description of the Caspian Sea. it hath not in all places the same name, but it is changed,
either according to the diversity of the Inhabitants that live about it, or the Provinces that border
upon it. It was called antiently the Sea of Chosar, from the Name of the eldest Son of Thogarma,
who was the Son of Gomer, and Grand-child of Iaphet, third Son to Noah. Nubius's
Geography calls it the Sea of Travisthan. The Moors call this Sea, as they do also the Gulf of
Arabia, Bohar Corsuin; and the Persians call it Kulsum, which name they also give the Red Sea.
The Greek and Latine Authors call it the Hyrcanian Sea, as also Mare Caspium and Caspianum.
The Persians call it by another name, the Sea of Baku, from the City of Bakuje, in the Province
of Schirwan; and the Muscovites name it Gualenskoi-more. But a man must be very cautious

how he credits what is affirmed by Dionysius Afer,1366. Pomponius Mela, Pliny, Solinus, and
those who follow them, as Strabo, Martianus Capella, St. Basil the Great, Macrobius, and others,
that it is only a Sinus, or Gulf of the great Sea of the Indies, or of the Tartarian Sea, or
that it hath some communication which the Euxine Sea, and Paulus Meotides by the River Tanais;
in as much as it is most certain, that it hath not any communication at all with the other
Seas, but it is of all sides so encompass'd with Land, that it may be more justly called the Mediterranean,Is a sea by it self.
than that which is known only by that name. Herodotus and Aristotle are much
more worthy credit, when they affirm, that the Caspian Sea is a particular Sea by it self, having
no communication with any other: and this is no more than what the Inhabitants of Kilan,
who live upon that Sea on the East-side, have so strongly confirmed us in, that we lay it down as
a thing no longer to be disputed.
               But what on the other side is much to be wondred at, is, that though so great a number of
Rivers incessantly pay the tribute of their waters into it, yet can it not be said what becomes
thereof. We at first could hardly be induc'd to believe what was told us concerning all those
Rivers; but when, at our return out of Persia, between Rescht and Schamachy, which was
twenty days journey, we took notice, that we had cross'd above fourscore great and small
Rivers, we made no difficulty then to acquiesce in the Relations we had before received thereof.
The most considerable of those we saw, are, the Wolga, Araxis, or Aras, which is joyned to
the Cyrus, which is now called Kur, the Kisilosein, the Bustrow, the Aksai, and the Koisu. Towards
the North are the Rivers of Iaika and Iems; and towards the South and East, the Nios,
the Oxus, and the Orxentes, which Q. Curtius calls, Tanais.
               And notwithstanding this vast Contribution of waters, this Sea is not perceiv'd to be any way
increas'd thereby, nor can it be said, by what passages all these Rivers are conveyed thence.
Some are of opinion, that they are, by subterranean Chanels return'd into the Ocean. The
Persians told us, that near Ferebath, between the Provinces of Tauristan, and Mesendan, there
is a Gulf, where all those waters are lost, as in a bottomless place, and convey'd away under the
neighbouring Mountains. But in regard a man must consequently to this assertion, imagine
that Gulf to be as big as the whole Sea, to swallow down the waters of so many Rivers, I cannot
be easily perswaded to side with the maintainers of that opinion. On the contrary, I think
it may be probably held, that there may be alleged, for the Caspian Sea, the same reasons as
are urged for Ocean's not overflowing the Earth, though an infinite number of Rivers fall into
it: To wit, that, besides the Mists, which are very frequent there, and consequently consume
a great part thereof, the rest is return'd by secret Chanels, to the sources of the Fountains and
Rivers, according to the wise-mans saying, that all the Rivers come out of the Sea, and return
thither again, whether it be that the weight of the Sea-water, which is not all within its Centre,
forces that which is lowest into the clefts of the earth, as far as the sources, and that this is
done with such violence, that at its breaking out of the earth, it spouts higher than the Sea it
self; or that there are in the earth certain veins, which, drawing the water to them, distribute
it to the Fountains and Rivers. The first ratiocination is Iulius Scaliger's, in his 46. Exercitation,
where he says, that he does not believe, the Argument which is deduc'd from the difference
of the qualities of waters can destroy the force of his, in regard we find by experience,
that the water, passing through the earth, is cleansed from its filth, and leaves its Salt at the
bottom, from which it is divided, much after the same manner as if it were distill'd through an
Alembick. Which is evidently seen by this, that the greater distance there is between the Sea
and the Fountains, the sweeter their waters are. It is also acknowledg'd, that there is no
Mountain higher than the Sea, which making but one part of the roundness of the Terrestrial
Globe, the swellings and emmencies, which are upon the earth are not higher than the Sea.
Which I affirm to be so much the more certain, upon this accompt, that, being, in my return
from Persia, between Schamachie and Derbent, at the Village of Soray, I had the curiosity to go
up into one of the adjacent Mountains, where I took the Horizon with my Astrolabe, and having
put my Dioptra into it, I turn'd myself towards the Sea, which was two Leagues distant
thence, and could easily discern it.
               The Authors who have written of the Caspian Sea, affirm, that, it is, in length fifteen dayes
journey, and in breadth, eight; which may fall out somewhat right, if it be in a great calm, and
that those who are to pass it, make use only of their Arms and Oars, and have no advantage
of wind.The length & breadth of the Caspian Sea. Whereupon I propose it as a particular observation, that, contrary to the common opinion
of all Geographers, as well antient as modern, the length of the Caspian Sea reaches
not from East to West, as it is set down in all Maps, even in those that have been publish'd since
the former impression of this Relation, where I condemn'd that errour, but that it is to be taken
from South to North, and that, on the contrary, it is its breadth which reaches from West
to East. And this I know, not only by the most exact observation I made thereof, but also by
a curious inquiry of the situation of all the Maritime Provinces, according to the Catalogue or
Register, of Longitudes and Latitudes, which I had from the Persians, as also consonantly to the
Astronomical fragments of the Learned M. Iohn Graves. For it is certain, that the true length

of the Caspian Sea,1636. is from the mouth of the River Wolga, below Astrachan, to Ferabath, in
the Province of Mesenderan, reaching eight degrees of the Aequator, which make 120. German
Leagues; and that its breadth, from the Province of Chuaresm, named by others Karragan, to
the Mountains of Circassia, or to Schirwan, is six degrees, which make but 90 German leagues.
According to this accompt thereof are to be corrected all the Geographical Maps, though the
opinion we introduce be new, and directly contrary to that which hath been receiv'd for so many
ages.
               Nor are we to give any more credit to what Q. Curtius affirms,The water is Salt. when he says, that the water
of the Caspian Sea is fresher than that of the Ocean, unless he be conceiv'd to speak only of
the coast of Hyrcania, which is now called Kilan, where indeed the water is neither salt nor
fresh, but brackish (as it is in several places of Holland) by reason of the mixture of the waters
of divers Rivers, which fall into the said Sea on that side. For, in the Sea it self, the water
is as salt as any other that ever I could taste of. Polybius and Arrian affirm the same thing of
the Euxine Sea; and Ovid confirms it by this Distick.
               
                  Copia tot laticum, quas anget, adulteret undas,
                  Nec patitur vires aequer habere suas.
               
               It is besides our design to engage into any discussion of Scaliger's position, who says in his 53
Exercitation, that the water of all Seas is sweet, or fresh, at the bottom, nor yet to examine
the Reasons alleged by him for that opinion, as falling not under the subject of our Relation.
But this we shall presume to affirm, that the Caspian Sea was not much known to the Greeks,
in the time of Alexander, since Arrian says, in the seventh Book of his History, that that
great Conquerour issu'd out his commands, that Timber should be fell'd in the neighbouring
Mountains, for the building of a Fleet, which he intended to employ in the discovery of that
Sea. It is certain also, that Q. Curtius speaks not of it otherwise than according to the knowledge
which some had thereof, in a time when that of the Romans had not pass'd the Euphrates.
no more than their Arms. For though Pliny says, lib. 6. ch. 17. of his Natural History, that
Seleuchus and Antiochus, the Successors of Alexander, made a discovery of that Sea by Patroclus,
their Admiral, yet he is withall forc'd to acknowledge, that there were many other things to
be discovered; as it was also our intention, to make use, to that purpose, of our Ship and Shallop
during the aboad we should make at the Court of Persia, if our misfortune in being cast away
upon this Sea had not defeated us of our expectations. Certain it is, that this Sea does
neither Ebb nor Flow,Neither Ebbs nor Flows. nay that indeed it is not capable of either; forasmuch as it hath no communication
or correspondence with the other, which, in that particular, follows the motion of
the Moon.
               The Persians, Tartars, and Muscovites seldome venture upon this Sea but in the Summertime,
and then dare they not hazard themselves far into it; for sailing only in wretched small
Barks, or Boats, they keep as near as they can to the shore, and never are out of sight of Land.
It hath in a manner no safe Havens or Harbours. The best it hath, is the same we spoke of before,
near Terki, between the Isle of Tzenzeni and the Continent; at which place the Persians
are wont to cast Anchor, and stay for a night. The havens of Baku, Lenkeran and Ferabath
are none of the worst, nor are they on the other side the safest; and the best Haven of all this
Sea, is on the side of the grand Tartary, and near the City of Minkischlak, which may
be found in the Itinerary of Anthony Ienkinson, under the name of Manguslave, but misnamed.
               But, how ere it be Haven'd, we may confidently affirm this, that we have been long enough
upon the Caspian Sea and its Coasts, to undeceive those who are apt to believe, what is deliver'd
by Petreius in his History of Muscovy, to wit, that the water of it is as black as Ink, and
that it is full of Islands, which are well stored with Inhabitants, and have in them a great number
of Cities and Villages; both which we affirm to be absolutely false. For the water of it is
of the same Colour, as that of all other Seas; and though we discover'd but some part of the Caspian
Sea, yet having made particular enquiry as to this particular, all the Persians, Tartars and
Muscovites I ever discoursed with concerning it, unanimously assur'd me, that in all that Sea
there is but one Island, wherein there is, I will not say either City or Village, but so much as
a House, unless it be in that of Ensil, near Ferabath, where the pastures being very good, such
as keep Cattel, have made certain Huts, not so much for their setled Habitations, as to prevent
the injuries of the Weather at certain times.
               I also enquired of the Inhabitants of Kilan, whether the Caspian Sea bred such an infinite
number of great Serpents, as Q. Curtius would make us believe: but they all assur'd me they
had never seen any, and that it was a thing they never had heard spoken of before, no more than
they had of a certain great round Fish without a Head, whereof Ambrosius Contarinus speaks in
the relation of his Travels, which Father Bizarrus hath Printed together with his History of
Perisa. He sayes, that this Fish is an ell and a half Diameter, and that there is a certain Liquor

drawn out of it, which the Persians use in their Lamps, and to grease the Camels, But the
Persians told me, that they stood not in need of any such Oyl to burn, since that near the City
of Baku, under the Mountain of Barmach, there are inexhaustible sources of a certain Liquor,
which they call Nefla, and make use of in their Lamps. And of this there is daily such
great quantities taken up, that it is transported all over the Kingdome.
               Certain indeed it is, that there may be seen in those parts a certain kind of Fish, which they
call Naka, that is, Glutton; which hath a very short Nose, and the Head as it were within the
Belly, having a round Tail, and being seven or eight foot in breadth, and not much less in
length. It fastens it self with the Tail to Fisher-mens Boats, and, if they be not very carefull,
over-turns them. The Persians told us also, that the white Fishes, of which we have spoken
heretofore, do the same, and that thence it comes, though the weather be ever so calm, the
Fisher-men never venture far into the Sea. This is the only Creature, which may in some measure
make good what Pomponius Mela sayes in his Geography, to wit, that the Caspian Sea
breeds so great a number of monstrous Fishes, which he calls Belluae, wild Beasts, that that is
one of the main Reasons, why it is not Navigable. This fish delights much in the Liver and
Flesh of Beef and Mutton, whence it is that the Inhabitants of Kilan, especially those who live
towards the Mountain of Sahebelan, as being the most hindred in their Fishing, make baits
thereof, wherewith they cover strong and sharp Hooks fasten'd to Great Cords, with which
they draw them to Land. Nor are we to credit what the same Bizarrus and Contarinus affirm,
when they say, that there is no other fish in the Caspian Sea; for, on the contrary, it is extremely
well stor'd with fish, and there are in it abundance of Salmons and Sturgeons, as also a
kind of Herrings; nay there are in it some fish, which in other places are numbred among the
fresh-water-fish, and are had only in ponds; as for instance Breams, which they call Chascham,
and Barbels, which they call Schwit: but the latter are tough and insipid, if they exceed two
foot in length. There is also a kind of Trouts, which they call Suggaht. These are not eaten
fresh, but falted and hung up in the smoke, and their way of dressing them, is, to lay them on
the hearth, with a clean linnen Cloath about them, and then to cover them with hot ashes, till
such time as they are ready: being thus ordered, they make a very pleasant and delicious dish.
There are no Pikes nor Eels in all Persia, insomuch that those Persians, whom the King sent
along with us into Germany, when they saw us eat Eeles, conceived a horrour thereat, as taking
them for Snakes. The King of Persia farms out the fishing of the Caspian Sea, towards
the mouths of Rivers, which brings him in very considerable sums of Money, many times more
than the Farmers make thereof, for instance, the City of Kesker, where a Farmer named
Schemsi paid eight thousand Crowns for the farming of five Rivers, which that year had yielded
but six thousand. Their fishing is only from September to April, and during that time, there
is a Palisadoe or kind of Hedge made in the Sea at the mouth of the River, to hinder the fishing
of those that have no right to fish, within that enclosure; but all the year besides it is indifferently
permitted to all, and in the Sea it self, at all times.
               
                  
                  
                  

                  
                  

               
            
            
               
               
               THE
TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, TARTARY,
and PERSIA.
               The Fifth Book.
               THe Countrey where we Landed,1636. or rather where the wrack cast us ashore, is
called Muskur, and makes part of the Province of Schirwan, or the Antient
Media, under the Jurisdiction of the Sulthan, or Governour of Derbent,
and comprehends, from the City of Derbent to the Province of Kilan, about
two hundred Villages. But before we come to give an accompt of what we
have seen in Persia, it is requisite in this place, that we give a general description
of that Country and its Provinces, upon this consideration, that there is not any Author
that hath hitherto undertaken this work, but hath confounded the Antient names of Cities and
Rivers with the Modern, and speaks thereof almost in the same terms, as the Greek and Latin
Histories, which treat of the antient Persia. The Map of this Country, which was some few
years since publish'd at Paris, is, no doubt, the most exact of any that have yet come to light:
but if any man will be at the pains, to confront the Names it gives the Cities and Provinces of
Persia, with those which are in this Map of ours, he will easily find the difference there is between
the one and the other.
               As to the name of Persia,The name of Persia. Herodotus, in the seventh Book of his History, sayes, that the
Amassador, whom Xerxes, King of Persia, sent to the Greeks, would have them believe, that
he deriv'd his original from Perses the Son of Persus and Andromeda. Ammianus Marcellinus
affirms, that the Persians are originally Scythians; and, if we credit Pliny, the Scythians
call them Chorur. The Holy Scripture calls them Elamites, and they give themselves the name
of Schai, thereby o be distinguish'd from the Turks, who, upon the same accompt, give themselves
that of Sunni. And as the same Turks have an affectation to call themselves Mussulmans,
so the Persians are much pleas'd, when they are called Kisilbachs, that is to say, Red-heads.
But of the Etymology of that word, we shall give an accompt hereafter, when we come to treat
of the habits of the Persians.
               It is most certain, that Parthia and Persia were heretofore two distinct Kingdomes, and that
the name of Persia hath not been common to both, till they became both subject to the same
King, and were inhabited by the same people. Upon the same Consideration it is, that we now
comprehend under the name of Persia, not only the Kingdom of Persia it self, but also all the

other Provinces which have been annexed thereto,1366. either by Conquest or otherwise, and are
now under the Jurisdiction of that Monarch. Hence it is, that when we speak of Persia, our
meaning is, to comprehend, under that name, all that Country, which reaches from North to
South-west, from the Caspian-sea, to the Gulf of Persia, and from East to West, from the River
Euphrates, which the Turks call Morat su, to the City of Candahar, upon the frontiers of
the Indies. By assigning it the Caspian-sea for its frontier, our meaning is to comprehend therein
near the one half of that sea, along the Mountains of Armenia, reaching West-ward as far
as the River of Ruth-Cane Kurkahn, by the Antients called Oxus, which divides the Persians
from the Vsbeques, who are the same that are called the Tartars of Buchar, and are for the most
part Tributaries to the King of Persia.
               Whence is to be observed by the way the error of Bottero, who, in his Politia Regin says, that
the extent of Persia from North to South is eighteen degrees. Wherein he is so much the more
mistaken, by how much it is certain, that, from the first City of Persia from the Caspian Sea,
to its utmost frontiers towards the Persian Gulf, there are hardly twelve degrees. For, let a
man but cast his Eye, not only on the Map, which we here give of it, but also on that of M.
Sampson, and particularly on that of the Learned Mr. Iohn Graves, not long since publish'd by
him in England, and he will find, that the City of Husum, which the Inhabitants of the Country
call Rescht, within two small Leagues of the Caspian Sea, lies at thirty seven degrees, and
that the City of Ormus, upon the Persian Gulf, is but at twenty five, which make but twelve
in all. We acknowledge that it contains above twenty degrees in length, from the Euphrates
to the Indies: but we are to consider withall, that one degree of Longitude under the thirty
seventh degree of Latitude, under which Persia ies, consists but of fifty minutes at the
most.
               The principal Provinces of the modern Persia are those of Erak, Fars, Schirwan, Adirbeitzan,
Kilan Thabristan, Msenderan, Iran or Karabag, Cherasan, Sablustan, Sitzestan, Kirman,
Chusistan, and Tzisire, or Diarbeck.
               The name of Erak,The Province of Erak. or Hierak, is common to two several Provinces, to wit, that whereof
the City of Babylon or Bagdat is the Metropolis, which is commonly called Erakain, and without
all question is the antient Assyria. But it is not of this Province that we have any account
to give in this place. Our Province of Erak, which is also called Erak-atzem, to distinguish it
from Erakain, lies in the midst of all Persia, next to the Province of Fars, and is the antient
Parthia. The Archontology, Printed not many years since at Frankfort, gives it the name of
of Charassen, but it confounds this Province with that of Chuaresm, which lies upon the Caspian
Sea, on the East-side, and is inhabited by the Tartars called the Vsbeques. The chief Cities
of the Province of Erak besides that of Ispahan, which is the Metropolis of the whole
Kingdom, are Caswin Sothanie, Senkan, Sawa, Kom, Kaschan, Rhey, Schaherrisur, Ebbcher, Hemedan,
Darkasin, Theheran, and Kulpajan, at which last place, the best Bows in Persia are
made.
               The Province of Fars,The Province of Fars. which De Laet, in his description of the State of Persia, calls Farc,
or Parc, but unadvisedly, is properly the antient Persia, whereof Persepolis was the chief City.
Alexander the Great caused it to be set on fire, out of a fond Compliance for a common Prostitute,
with whom he had over-drunk himself. It is reported, that the ruins of that City became
the foundation of that of Schiras upon the River Bendemir, which Q. Curtius calls Araxis,
Its principal Cities, besides that of Schiras, whereof there will be an accompt given in
the following Travels of Mr. Mandelslo into the Indies, are Kasirus, Bunitzan, Firusabath, and
Astar: whereto may be added the City of Lahor, with the little Province which derives its
name from it.
               The Province of Sciruan is known in the Maps under the name of Servan,The Province of Sciruan. and is no doubt
that which the Antients called Media Acropatia, though Ienkinson, in his Itinerary. affirms,
that it is the antient Hyrcania. It is indeed the most Northerly part of the antient Media, which
Herodotus and Strabo deliver to be Mountainous and Cold. Whereof we had a sufficient experience
in our Travels, after our departure from Schamachie, as will be seen in its due place.
Schamachie is the Metropolis of the Province, wherein there are besides, Bakuje seated at the
foot of a Mountain upon the Caspian-sea, which from its name is called the sea of Baku: That
of Derbent, which is one of the Passages which the Antients called Pylae Caspiae. This is that
which Alexander the Great caused to be built, and called Alexandria, upon which accompt
it is that the Inhabitants do often call it Schacher Iunan, that is, the City of the Greeks: That of
Schabran, in the Country of Muskur, near the place where the wrack cast us ashore. The City
of Eres, or Aras, is destroyed; but there may be seen the remainders of what it hath been
heretofore, upon the River Arras, which is now called Arisbar.
               The Province of Iran, which the Inhabitants of the Country commonly and for the most
part called Karabag,The Province of Iran. is seated between the two famous Rivers of Araxes and Cyrus, which
are now called Aras and Rur, and comprehends some part of the two Provinces of Armenia
and Georgia, which the Persians call Armenich and Gurtz. It is one of the noblest and richest

Provinces of all Persia,1636. and in this particularly, that it produces more Silk than any other. It
is sub-divided into several other lesser Provinces, to wit, those of Kappan, Tzulfa, Scabus,
Sisian, Keschtas, Sarsebil, Ervan or Iruan, Kergbulag, Agustawa, Aberan, Scorgd, Saschat,
Intze, Thabak-melek, Thumanis, Alget, and Tzilder. The principal Cities, Forts, and Towns
of it are Berde, Bilagan, Skemkur, Kentze, Berkuschat, Nachtscuan, Ordebad, Bajesied, Maku,
Magasburt, Tiftis and Tzilder. This great Province might very well deserve a larger account
to be given of it; but in regard it borders upon the Turk, and that I have been so fortunate, as
to meet with a very accurate Map of this Country, together with a particular relation of what
ever is most observable therein, we shall endeavour to find else-where some occasion to speak of
a thing, which to treat of in this place would make too great a Digression.
               Adirbeitzan,The Province of Adirbeitzan. which the Europaeans are wont to name Aderbajon, or Adarbigian, is the more
Southerly part of the Antient Media, to wit, that part which the Antients call Media Major.
And forasmuch as it is acknowledg'd that the Province of Kurdestan is that which the Antients
call'd Assyria, we may in some measure be satisfy'd with what Nubius's Geography says, to wit, that
it is the more Northerly part of Assyria, since they have their Frontiers common, and in a manner
confounded. It is divided from the Province of Schiruan, by the Deserts of Mokan, and from that
of Karabag, by the River Aras, and it hath, on the East, the Province of Kilan. Adirbeitzan is also
sub-divided into many other little Provinces, as Erschee, Meschkin, Kermeruth, Scrab, Chalchal,
Tharumat, Suldus, Vtzam, &c. Its principal Cities are Ardbil and Tauris. The former
is famous for the Birth of Schich Sefi, Author of the Sect of the Perses, who liv'd and dy'd in
that City, where his Tomb is yet to be seen, as also those of several other Kings of Persia, of
whom we shall have occasion to speak hereafter. The City of Tauris or Tabris, which is
thought to be that of Gabris according to Ptolomey, and which Ortelius affirms to be the antient
Ecbatana, heretofore the most considerable place in all the East, and the ordinary residence
of the Kings of Persia, is seated at the foot of the Mountain Orontes, eight dayes journey from
the Caspian Sea, and is one of the richest and most populous Cities of Persia. The rest are Merrague,
Salmas, Choi, Miane, Karniarug, Thesu, Thel, and Tzeuster. Tzors and Vrami are two
places excellently well fortify'd, and in the latter is to be seen the Sepulchre of urla, the Wife
of King Casan, which if it bears any proportion to the stature of that Woman, she must needs
have been a Giantess, and of an extraordinary height, since the Tomb is above forty foot
long.
               The Province of Kilan derives its name from the people that inhabit it,The Province of Kilan. who are called Kilek.
It is the antient Hyrcania. For its situation absolutely agrees with that which is given it
by Quintus Curtius, and that it is encompass'd, after the manner of a Crescent, with a Mountain
cover'd with Trees. It is water'd by many little Rivers. It comprehends several other
Provinces, among which, some number that of Thabristan or Mesauderan, which is the same
with that, whose Inhabitants, in the time of Alexander the Great, were called Mardi. The
rest are Kisilagas, Deschteuend, Maranku, Maschican, Lengerkunan, Astara, Buladi, Schigkeran,
Nokeran, Kilikeraa, Houe, Lemur, Disekeran, Lissar, Tzeulandan, Rihk, Kesker, Rescht,
Lahetzan, and Astarabath, containing forty six Cities, and a very great number of Villages.
The principal Cities are,Mesanderan. Astrabath, Metropolis of the Province of the same name; and Firascu,
where may be had the fairest Turquoises in the Kingdome. In Mesanderan are Amul,
Funkabun, Nei, Sarou, Nourketzour, and the noble and pleasant City of Ferabath. It was heretofore
called Tahona, but Schach Abas was so pleas'd with it, that many times he pass'd over the
Winter therein, and gave it the name it now hath, from the word Frah, which signifies pleasant
or delightful. Indeed the whole Country is such, so that they who affirm that fruits hardly
ripen in it by reason of its coldness, injure it very much; unless it be that they speak of its
Mountains, which indeed are not habitable: but the plains are very populous, and very fertile,
and so pleasant, that the Persians say it is the Garden of the Kingdome, as Touraine is, of
France. Whence the Hakim, or Poet, Fardausi had reason to say,

                     Tschu Mesanderan, Tschu Kulkend Sar?
                     Nikerem we nesert, henis che besar?
                  
               
               That is,Lahetza. What is Mesanderan? Is it not a place set with Roses? neither too Hot, nor too
Cold, but a perpetual Spring? Lahetzan is famous for its Silk, which it hath better than any
other place; and its principal Cities are Lenkeru, Kutsesbar, and Amelekende. In the Province
of Rescht,Rescht??? besides the Metropolis of the same name, are the Cities of Kisma, Fumen, Tullum,
Scheft, Dilum, and Massula. This last is built upon a Mountain, by reason of an Iron-mine, by
which the inhabitants, who are most Smiths, maintain themselves. There are also in those
parts abundance of Wall-nut Trees, whereof are made most of the Wooden dishes that are all
over Persia.Kesker. In Kesker are the Cities of Kesker, Scaherruth, Kurab, Enseli, Dulab, Schal; and
towards the North, Ruesseru, Miunscaker, Senguerasara, Houe, Chosckkaderene, Henklan, and
Kisilagats. There is no entrance into the Province of Kilan, but by the four passages, whereof
we shall speak hereafter, in the last Book of the Travels of the Ambassadors, as also of the

Caspian gates, the insolence of the people who live between Mesandaran and Kesker, and the
History of Karib Schach.
               Chorasan,The Province of Choralan. or the antient Bactriana, hath on the West, Mesanderan, and comprehends also
several other lesser Provinces, whereof the chiefest is that of Heri, the Metropolis whereof
is Herat. This Province is one of the greatest, and most fertil of any in Persia, and that which
drives on the greatest Trade of any. The City of Mesched, which, in the Catalogue or Register
of their Cities, may be found under the name of Thus, is no doubt the most considerable
of any. It is encompass'd with a noble Wall, set out with many sumptuous Structures, and
among others with two, or if we may believe Texeira, three hundred Towers, distant one from
the other about a Musquet shot. In this City is to be seen the Sepulchre of Iman Risa, one of
the twelve Saints of Persia, of the Family of Aly, which, as to its Structure, Revenue, and
Wealth, is equal to that of Ardebil, and all things are performed there with the same Ceremonies.
The same Devotions are also done there as at the Tomb of Schich Sesi. In the Country
about Mesched, near the City of Nisabur, there is a Mountain, where are found such Excellent
Turquezes, that the King permits them not to be sold to any but himself. Herath is the
second City of the Province, and there, is made the best Persian Tapistry. The Indians Trade
thither, and it is a place they must necessarily pass through, who go from Candahar to Ispahan.
There it was that the Horses of the Great Mogul's Ambassador were stay'd, whereof we shall
say more hereafter. Thun, Thabeskileki, and Thabes-Mssinan, are very considerable Cities,
as well upon the accompt of their greatness, as of the several Manufactures of Silk that are
made there, and wherewith they drive a vast Trade. All the other Cities, as Sebseuar, Turschis,
Kain, Puschentz, Badkis, Meru, Merurnd, Tzurtzan, Fariab, Asurkan, Belch, Bamian,
Semkan, Thalecan, and Sus, are also very populous, and eminent for Merchandise, and in these
parts is found the best Manna in the World.
               The Province of Sablusthan lies more towards the East,The Province of Sablusthan Q. Curtius calls the Inhabitants of
it Paropanisadae, from the neighbouring Mountain, called Paropamisus, which is a branch of
Mount Taurus, and it is all Wooddy. The people living in it, is, at this day, as simple and
barbarous as they were in the time of Alexander. It is upon this Mountain that Goropius Becanus
would have Noab's Ark rest, after the deluge, contrary to the opinion of most of the Fathers,
who, for the most part, agree, that it rested upon Mount Aratat in Armenia. The
Cities of this Province are Beksabath, Meimine; Asbe, Bust, and Sarents.
               The Province of Sitzistan,Sitzistan. by others called Sigestan, Sagestan, and Siston, lies South-ward
from the Province of Sablustan, and is the Habitation of the people, who were heretofore called
Dragae. It is encompass'd of all sides by a high Mountain; and it is the Country of the Grand
Rustam, who is known not only in their Histories, but is also the only celebrated Heros
of all their Romances. The principal Cities of this Province, are Sistan, Chaluk,
Ketz, &c.
               The Province of Kirman is also one of the greatest of the Kingdome of Persia.Kirman. It lies between
those of Fars and Sigestan, and reaches as far as the Sea, and the Island of Ornus. The
Country is somewhat un-even, and Mountainous, but the Valleys of it are very fertil and delightful,
abounding in Fruit, and every where cover'd, and as it were strew'd with Flowers,
especially Roses, whereof this Province produces such great quantity, that a considerable part
of its Revenue is rais'd out of the water made of them. The Inhabitants call it Gulap, whence
it may be well imagin'd that the Word Iulip comes, and they drive a great Trade with it, especially
at Ispahan. Those who Trade most in it, are the Lurs, who are a sort of people by themselves,
distinguish'd from the other Persians by what they wear about their Heads, which is a
kind of Coiffure, that is longer and narrower than the ordinary Turbants, and there is fasten'd to
it a tuft or tassel, which hangs down over the Back. There is also in this Province a Drugg very
soverain against the Worms, which is called Daru Kirman, as well upon accompt of the
Province, as also hence, that the Word Kirman signifies a Worm. And concerning this, there
is a story of one of their Kings, who being in the fields on Horse-back, heard himself call'd by
his own name. He look'd back, as if he had heard the voice behind him, and seeing only a dead
man's skull half rotten upon the ground, and doubting the voice proceeded thence, he asked,
who it was. The skull answer'd, that that was all was left of what he had sometime been; that
he had worn a Crown as well as himself, and had Conquer'd several great Provinces, but that
desirous to add, to his other Conquests, that of Kirman, he had been over-come and eaten;
exhorting him to reflect on what he had seen, and to make his advantage of that Philosophy.
The Province is barren enough towards the North, having on that side abundance of heathy
grounds; but towards the Sea-side it is very fertil. Its principal Cities are Birsir, Bermasir,
Bem, Chabis, Tzirest, Kamron, and Ormus, Kamron is a Sea-port, whence it is many times
called Bender, or Bender Kamron. Ormus, by the Persians called Hormous, is an Island, three
Leagues distant from the Continent: but of these two places, the Reader will have a further
accompt in the first Book of Mandelso's Travels into the Indies. There is comprehended also

under the Province of Kirman,1366??? that of Mekeran, wherein are the Cities of Firh, Kitz, and
Chalak.
               Chusistan is the same which was heretofore called Susiana, and in the time of the Hebrews
Elam.The Province of Chsistan??? It lies between the Province of Fars and the River Dilsel, and its Metropolis was Susa,
famous for the Vision which the Prophet Daniel had there, concerning the determination of the
Persian Monarchy, and the beginning of the Grecian. It is now called Desu. It was also in
these parts that the palace of Susa stood, upon the River Vlai, where King Ahasuerus, King
over twenty seven Provinces, made his great Feast. Its chief Cities are Ahawas, Ramchormus,
Scabur, Askar, and Arhan. The heats in these parts are so great, especially towards the
South-part of the Mountain, that, in the Summer time, the Inhabitants are forc'd to forsake
the Cities, and retire themselves into the Mountain.
               Tzisire is found in the Catalogue of the Provinces of Persia,The Province of Tzisire, or Diarbek. and it is the antient Mesopotamia.
Now it is commonly called Diarbek, and lies between the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris,
which the Turks call Digel. This Province hath been often taken and retaken by them from the
Persians; so that it is not alwayes under the Schach's Jurisdiction, but then only when he is
Master of Bagdat, or Babylon, and Mosul, which some affirm to have been the antient Ninive.
'Tis true, Bagdat is not properly in the Province of Diarbek, but in that of Eracain, as are also
the Cities of Wasith, Besre, Rusa, and Medain.
               As to the City of Bagdat, there is nothing so certain, as that it was built, out of the ruins of
the antient Babylon, but not in the same place, in as much as Babylon stood upon the Euphrates,
which ran through it, as is expressely affirmed by Strabo; whereas Bagdat is seated upon the
Tigris, which joyns with the Euphrates, a League below the City. The Persians are of opinion,
that the Inhabitants of Babylon had heretofore their Summer-Houses and Gardens at the
place where now Bagdat stands, insomuch that after the destruction of the City, they found it
no great difficulty to remove their habitations thither. And indeed, the word Bag, which
singnifies a Garden, and Bagdat, a place full of Gardens, does in some measure confirm their
opinion.
               To resume our former discourse,The Province of Schiruan
                   the Country where we were cast a-shore, is very pleasant,
it was all over green at the time of our arrival, and the Birds, which were not yet sensible of
the Cold, ordinary in our parts, continued their Chirping and Singing till near the middle of
December. The soil there is very good, bringing forth Rice, Wheat, and Barley, in great
abundance. They make no Hay, because their Cattle are out Winter and Summer; but if
they make any, it is only for the convenience of Travellers. Their Vines were scatter'd up and
down, Planted without any care or order, all along the Hedges the Vines being fasten'd to the
Trees, so as that they spread up to the extremities of the Boughs, from which the small branches
hung donw three or four Ells in length. All the Province of Kilan is full of them, and at our
return, we saw very fair and very large ones, at Astora. The Country affords good store of
Wild-fowl, especially Pheasants, as also of Hares, the Hunting whereof found us good sport
during the aboad we were forc'd to make there. There is also in these parts a certain kind of
Foxes, which they call Shakal, about the bigness of those of Europe, (of which kind there
are also abundance, and the Inhabitants call them Tulki) but instead of Furr or Hair, they
are cover'd with Wool, and have white bellies, Ears all black, and less Tails than those of our
parts. We heard them in the night time running in Herds about the Village, and were not
a little troubled at their Cries, which was a drawling and doleful noise, without any intermission.
               The Inhabitants make use of Buffles or wild Oxen, more than they do of Horses, but instead
of loading them upon their Backs, they make them draw Wood, or any other things of
great weight. Their ordinary sustenance is Feny-greek, wherewith they sow whole Fields, as
we do with Vetches and Lentills, and they cut it while it is yet green, Herb and Seed together,
and so give it those Creatures to eat. The Milk, I mean that of the Females, is so fat, that it
makes a Cream two fingers thick, of which they make exellent Butter. They never make any
Cheese of Cow's-milk, but only of sheeps.
               The Village of Niasabath is at 41 deg. 15 min. Elevation,The Houses of Persia. and hath not above 15 or 16 poor
Houses, which lye scatter'd up and down, all built of Clay, and absolutely square, having
flat Roofs, and cover'd with Turfs, so as that a man might walk upon them without either danger
or inconvenience. And indeed it is ordinary among the Persians, to erect Tents upon them,
to eat, and, in the summer-time, to lye on them all night, that they may the more participate of the
coolness of the Air. Here it was that I first understood what the Gospel says of the Paralytick, who
was let down through the Roof of the House; and the Counsel our Saviour gave those who
were upon the House-top, not to come down into the House; for this is their way of building
all over the East. We were at first lodg'd in the Houses, which were very handsome within,
and the floors of the Chambers for the most part cover'd with Tapistry, and the Masters of the
Houses receiv'd and treated us the first day very well. But the Village being but small, not able
to find Lodging for all our retinue, and our aboad being likely to be too long there for us

to lye upon the charges of the Inhabitants, we got Tents pitch'd near the Lodgings of the Ambassadors,
where we continu'd till the Court of Persia took order for our departure thence.
We had no Bread; our Beer was lost with the ship, and the Village had no spring of fresh water;
so that we were forc'd to look after our Mouldy scraps, and to content our selves with
the troubled water of a small Torrent, which pass'd near the Village, while our ship furnish'd
us with firing for the Kitchen and the Chambers.
               Nov. 19. Schachewerdi, Governour of Derbent sent to complement us, upon the occasion of
our arrival there, two Persons, very well clad, one whereof was Brother to the Kaucha of
Niasabath. They deliver'd the Ambassadors the Sulthan's Letter, which came with a Present
of two Horses, as many Oxen, twelve sheep, twenty Pullets, three great Pitchers
of Wine, one Pitcher of Water, two Paniers of Apples, and three sacks of Wheatflower.
               But the Ambassadors coming to understand, that the Sulthan's Letter made mention only
of one Horse, they would not receive the other, though the Persians earnestly protested, that
the mistake came only hence, that the Sulthan imagining there had been but one Ambassador,
had accordingly sent but one Horse, and that they, coming afterwards to hear there were two,
had bought another horse, out of an assurance that it was the Sulthan's intention to have done
so.Brugmans incivility. But notwithstanding all their allegatons and instances, the Ambassador Brugman would
by no means accept of the horse, for no other reason, doubtless, than this, that his was not so
good as his Collegue's. The Persians were not a little troubled thereat, and look'd on it as an
affront done the Sulthan, who resented it so highly since, that he did us all the ill-Offices lay in
his power, being also further troubled in this respect, that, contrary to the custom of Persia and
Muscovy, upon the Ambassador Brugman's untowardness, his People had been sent away
without Presents.
               The 22. the Ambassadors sent Francis Meurier, one of our Retinue, with our Persian Interpreter,
to the Chan or Governour general of the Province of Schiruan, whose ordinary residence
is at Scamachie, to acquaint him with our arrival, and to entreat him to supply us with
all things necessary for the continuation of our journey. The Governour, who had heard of it
by some other means had immediately sent a Mehemander to us (so they call in Persia those
who among the Muscovites are called Pristafs, whose charge it is to conduct the Ambassadors
through the Country, and to see them furnish'd with Provisions and Carriage) but our people
had mist him by the way.
               This Mehemander came to our Quarters the 29. of November. He was most sumptuously
Cloathed, and excellently well mounted, on a very gallant horse, the Harness whereof was
cover'd with Gold, and beset with Turquezes. He acquitted himself very handsomly both in
his address and complement, with promises of all the civilities and services it was in his power
to do us, as long as we should be under his conduct, which was as far as Schamachie. Having
answer'd his Complement, we invited him, and those who came along with him, to taste of
our fruits, and of all sorts of Aquavitae, wherewith we were well stor'd. We also caused our
great Guns to be discharg'd, and we entertain'd them with our Musick, wherewith they seem'd
to be much taken. As soon as the Mehemander was return'd to his Lodging, he sent us a Present
of five sheep, three Pitchers of Wine, and some Pomegranates.
               Nov. the last, came back Francis Meurier with the Interpreter, bringing this accompt, that
the Chan being not at Scamachie, at their coming thither, they had been oblig'd to follow
him into the Country, where they had found him encamp'd under Tents, with a Retinue of about
four hundred persons: That he had receiv'd them kindly, and had assur'd them, that he
had already sent a Mehemandar, whose care it should be to see the Ambassadors supply'd with
all things necessary for the continuation of their journey; that he had told them further, that he
heard the Ambassadors had a Retinue of about three hundred men, but they should be all welcome,
though they were twice the number: That it was a great while since we first heard of
this Embassy, and that he was very desirous to see us. To which accompt the Interpreter added
only this, that the Governour had particularly desir'd to be inform'd by him, of the quality
and humours of the Ambassadors, as also of that of the persons whereof our Retinue consisted,
and our manner of life.
               The first ill Office the Sulthan of Derbent did us, was, in denying us a sufficient number of
horses and other cattel for the carriage of our selves and our Baggage.The Governours resentment. Which prov'd so considerable
a rub in our way, that our Mehemander was forc'd to return to Scamachie, where he spent
above a moneth in getting together such a number of cattel as might carry us and all we had:
during all which time we were forc'd to continue still in the Village of Niasabath.
               During that time was dis-embarqu'd, much about the same place, the Cuptzi or Persian
Merchant,The Cuptzi comes to Niasabath of whom we have spoken before, after he had run the same hazard upon the Caspian
Sea as we had so narrowly escaped.
               Nov. 24. came in thither a small Boat with five persons in it, who were all left of fifty, who
had been cast away with the ship, which was bound for Kilan, the thirteenth before; so that

those poor people had been ten dayes together strugling with the wind and waves ere they could
get Land.
               The joy we might well conceive at our being in Persia, after so troublesome a Voyage,
wherein we had run through so many dangers, was much abated by the inconveniences which
the untowardness and humoursomness of one of the Chiefest in the Company run us into: but I
shall spare the Reader the dissatisfaction of finding any thing in this relation but what is divertive.
The better to overcome the affliction it put us all into, we, who were of Msnie, entred intred
into a little society among our selves, and taking our advantage of the fair weather we had
the first of December, we went all together in a Company about a quarter of a League from the
Village, where we found out a little place, whereof the Rivulet maketh almost a Peninsula, so
pleasant and inviting, that the fairest Meadows in Europe afford not any thing so delightful in
the best Season of the year. The water came almost round about that little parcel of ground,
and the Pomegranate-Trees, which had joyn'd their verdure with that of the Vines, invited us
to rest our selves under their shade, and to divert our selves with the memory of our dear Countrey:
to which divertisement our Physician, Dr. Graman, contributed very much, by the good
cheer he made us of Gamons of Bacon, Neats Tongues, and two or three sorts of Sack and
Aquavitae, whereof he had still good store left. This was our divertisement for several dayes.
               Decemb. 9.The Tartar-Prince of Dagestan visits te Ambassadors. The Ambassadors were visited by the same Tartar Prince of Tarku, who had given
us a Visit at Terki. He was accompany'd by his brother, and attended by a Retinue of about
twenty persons. After his Visit, he went to the next Village to look for Lodging, there being
none to be had in ours, and sent us the next day, as a Present, an Ox, some Sheep, and two
great Paniers of Apples. That which the Ambassadors sent in return thereto, consisted in certain
Ells of Cloath and Satin, a Vessel of Aquavitae, and a Roll of Tobacco. And whereas he
had express'd, that they would do him a great kindness to give him a little Gun-powder, to be
reveng'd for the incursions which Sulthan Mahomet had made into his Territories, the Ambassadors
sent him a Barrel that weigh'd 80. pounds.
               The return of our Mehemandar, who came back the same day, made us the more joyfull,
in that he assur'd us, that within 15. dayes, there should be brought us out of Scamachie and
Derbent such a number of Wagons, Camels, and Horses, as that nothing should retard our
journey any longer.
               According to this promise, the 12. there came in some Horses and Camels, but we heard of
no more afterwards. The Mehemandar excused himself upon the Snow that had fallen the night
before, and said, that the Persians were wont to travel in the cold, and that the Camels
whose hoofs are not so falt as those of other Creatures, would not have been able to go by reason
of the slipperiness of the way. Whereto he added, that it had hapned, that whole Caravans
had perish'd, through cold, in the Mountains, for want of Wood and Lodging, which are
very scarce upon that Road, though there be but twenty Leagues, or Farsangs, from Niasabath
to Scamachie. True it is indeed, that for some nights we had Snow, but the Sun melted it as
soon as he appear'd over the Horizon. But how ere it happen'd, we were forc'd to stay there
ten dayes longer; which made us imagine that what was done was out of design, purposely to
defer our departure thence, till they should receive the Orders which they expected from the
Sophy concerning our subsistence; for till then we had been upon our own charge.
               During our stay at Niasabath,Brugman's indiscretion. the Ambassador Brugman would needs cut some certain beams,
which the Sophy had, wich vast charge, brought to the Sea-side, to be employ'd in the building
of his ships, and cause Carriages to be made thereof for our Artillery, not regarding the Remonstrances
of the Persians, who told him, that if he made use of those beams, the ophy could
not build his ships that year. The Ambassador went on in his intended design, and told those
of our Retinue, who would have disswaded him from it, that it was the humour of that Nation,
not to do any thing till they are forc'd to it, and that the only way was to domineer over them.
But the Persians had afterwards the advantage to laugh at us, when they furnish'd us with so
few horses, that being not able to draw our Artillery, we were forc'd to leave our Carriages
behind, and to load our Guns upon Camels.
               Decemb. 21. there came to us two Mehemandars, one from Scamachie, the other from Derbent,
bringing along with them about forry Camels, thirty Waggons drawn by wild Oxen,
and eighty Horses, which being loaden with the Baggage, went before, with some of our servants.
But when the Ambassadors themselves were to go, and that what belong'd to their
Chambers and the Kitchin was to be pack'd up, there were but sixty Horses left for all the rest
of the Retinue, which was 94. persons. The Mehemandar swore by the head of his King
(which is the greatest Oath among the Persians) that he could not possibly find any more,
telling us, that while we were within the Government of the Sulthan of Derbent, whom, without
any occasion, we must needs disoblige, we were not to hope any better treatment, 
that as soon as we were come within the Government of Scamachie, we should not want any
thing requisite for the prosecution of our journey, if in the mean time we could pluck up a good
heart, and set our selves once in the way.
               
                  
Hence it came, that upon the 22. of December we were forc'd to depart, some on Hors-back,
some behind them, and the rest, to wit, the Lacqueys, the Guards, and the Soldiers, afoot.
Our way lay South-ward along the Caspian Sea,The Ambassadors leave Niasabath. and we cross'd that day four small Rivers.
The first place we Lodg'd at was the Village of Mordou, within the Government of Scamachy,
somewhat above four Leagues from Niasabath. The houses there were all round, and built up
of Ozier and Canes, as those of the Tartars. The Inhabitants call them Ottak. The nights
were cold enough, and there was no Wood in the Village, so that we spent our time there
uneasily enough, especially those, who had wetted themselves by going through the water
afoot.
               The word Mordou signifies a Fen, and the Village derives its name from the Fenny places
which lye about it, wherein there are many Springs, which send forth their water with such
violence, that there is no cold so great as to congeal them. Whence it comes, that there are
abundance of Swans there, even in the Winter, whose down is gather'd for the Sophy's Beds
and Pillows.Padars. a people. This Village is inhabited by a certain people whom they call Padars, who have
their particular language, though with some relation to the Turkish and Persian. Their Religion
is the Mahumetane, inclining to the Turkish, but accompany'd besides with infinite Superstitions.
Among others they have this, that they leave their meat after it is dressed, to grow
almost cold before they eat it, and if it happen that any one, ignorant of their customs, should
blow or breath upon it, they cast it away as impure.
               The Ambassador Brugman sent for the Kaucha or Bayly of Niasabath, and complain'd to
him of the ill Offices done us by the Sulthan of Derbent, in not allowing the Carriage necessary
for the prosecution of our Voyage; insomuch that he was oblig'd to see some part of his Retinue,
whom he lov'd as his own eyes, go afoot, and likely to miscarry by the way, of which
proceeding he should give the Sophy a full accompt as soon as he came to Court. The Kaucha
made answer, that it must needs be, the Sulthan knew not we had so much Baggage; but said
withall, that he could not imagine what pleasure we took in carrying along with us Sails, brass
Guns, and Carriages, which could only put us to trouble, and retard our journey, and that if
the Ambassador did put up his complaints, the Sulthan for his part would easily find out wayes
to justifie himself. The next day, our Mehemandar brought us twenty horses more, so that
having lessen'd our Baggage by certain Chests and useless Vessels, which were ordered to be
broken, we made a shift to set all our people on Horse-back. We travell'd that day three leagues,
and came at night to the Village of Tachousi, which lies in a bottom, and hath very handsome
Houses.
               The 24. we got three Leagues further,They lodge in a Caravansera. and came to the high Mountain of Barmach, at the
foot whereof we took up our quarters, in a great Court, which was all open, and had only the
four bare Walls. The Persians call those places Caravanseras, and they are as the Ventas in
Spain, and serve for Inns upon the High-way, in the deserts of Persia. They are within a dayes
Journey one of another, for the greater convenience of Travellers, who are oblig'd to bring
along with them Provisions and Forrage for Horse and Man, for you find in them, at the best,
but Chambers and Halls, and those not furnish'd with any thing, and have only a Roof to keep
you dry.
               The Waggoners and Mule-drivers of Derbent made a shew as if they would have return'd,
and have left us there, to stay till other conveniences of Riding and Carriage were brought us
from Schamachie: but finding, on the other side, that the Ambassadors had ordered the Drums
to be beaten to bring their people together, and that command was issued out that all should
march a-foot, and abandon the Baggage, to be made good at their perils who refus'd to supply
them with necessary carriages, they chang'd their resolution, and staid.
               The Caravansera was a very antient structure, all built with large Free-stones, being forty
two paces square. Over the Gate, there were two Chambers, where we found certain Inscriptions
and Hebrew Letters, and some Characters, which none in the company could either read
or comprehend.
               The 25. being Christmas day, we did our Devotions in the great Stable which was appointed
for the Camels; which done, some of our retinue had the curiosity to go and take a view of
the Mountain, induc'd thereto by the maraculous relations which the Persians had made us
thereof by the way.
               This Mountain lies within a quarter of a League of the Caspian Sea,The Mountain of Barmach. and, by reason of its extraordinary
height, is seen at a very great distance. It is in a manner round, having on the very
top of it a great Rock streight up, and very steepy of all sides, from which it hath the name of
Barmach, that is, finger: because it looks like a finger stretch'd out above the other adjacent
Mountains. We understood since, that there is a path, which will commodiously enough bring
one to the top of it, but we knew it not then, so that we ran great hazard of our Lives in getting
up by dreadful precipices.
               It was so cold upon the Mountain, that the Grass, which was high enough there, was all cover'd
with a white frost as with Sugar-candy, whereas at the foot of the Mountain, near the

Caravansera, the weather was fair and mild. Upon the edge of the Mountain, and at the foot
of the Rock, there is a plain of about fifty perches square, which hath in the midst of it, a
very fair Well, built about with stone, and about that Well may be seen the ruins of a very
thick Wall, flank'd at the corners with certain Towers and Bulwarks, wherewith that structure
had sometime been fortify'd, as also with two good deep ditches built about with Free-stone,
which satisfy'd us they were the ruins of an impregnable Fortress. Towards the Northern part
of the Mountain,Ruins of Fortresses. we met with other ruins, which could be no other than the remainders of
another Fort. They facilitated our access to an ascent, which was cut in the Rocks, and conducted
us almost up to the Top, where we saw a Vault, and the remainder of a third Structure,
which had sometimes serv'd for a Dungeon, or place of retreat, after the loss of the two
other Forts.
               I imagine that this may have been one of those Fortifications,The opinion of the Persians concerning these Fortresses. which the Antients called
Portae Caspiae, or Ferreae, whereof there is a description in the Greek and Latin Histories. The
Persians are of opinion, that these structures were built by Iscander, so they call Alexander
the Great, and that they were demolish'd by Tamberlane. We rested out selves upon the
Rock, where we sung Te Deum, and renew'd among our selves the friendship, which we had
before mutually promis'd each other by most unfeigned protestations: and having gather'd certain
Figs off the Trees, which grew out of the clefts of the Rock, we got down again with less
trouble and danger, by the ordinary path.
               The 26. we left Barmach, having very fair weather, the Sun casting at that time a greater
heat than it does with us in May. The Waggons, with the Baggage, took the way of the
plain towards Bakuje, and the Ambassadors, with those of the retinue, who were on Horse-back,
took that of the Mountain. We Travell'd that day five leagues, and came at night to a
Village named Chanega, within the Mountains. There, we met with abundance of excellent
Fruits, and good store of Honey; but the water thereabouts was troubled, corrupted, and
stunk.
               The next day,The Sepulchre of a Persian Saint. Decemb. 27. we got five Leagues further, to a Village named Pyrmaraas,
three Leagues from Scamachie. This place is very famous, by reason of one of their Saints
named Scid-Ibrahim, whose Sepulchre is to be seen there. The Persians affirm it to be very antient,
and so great a Veneration had for it, that Tamberlane, who had no religious respect for
any thing, would not meddle with that Sepulchre, though he destroy'd all else that lay in his
way. This structure hath its Walls, and its two Courts, as a Castle. Our Ambassadors sent
the Mehemandar to the Guardian of the place, to entreat him, that they might be permitted
to enter; but all they could obtain, was only to see the first Court, which was full of square
stones, which were set up-an-end, to distinguish the Graves of private Persons.
               I had a great desire to get a little nearer,The Sepulchre described. and, if it were possible, to see the Saint's Sepulchre.
Whereupon, I return'd thither in the Evening, and set down in my Table-Book the Arabian
Inscriptions, which I found Grav'd here and there upon the Walls. The Persians, who imagin'd
what I did was in honour of their Saint, suffer'd me to proceed in what I was about. I
made my advantage of that liberty to slip in at the Gate of the second Court, where I found
many other Inscriptions. I bestow'd about half an hour in Copying them out, and perceiving
they took no further notice of me, I ventur'd so far as to open the Door which goes into the
structure it self, which being made fast only with a wooden pin, it was no hard matter for me
to open it, and to get in. It consisted of many arched apartments, which had no light, but what
came in by certain little Windows, which put me into a little fright. In the first apartment,
there was, just opposite to the door, a Tomb about two foot high, having as many steps to get
up to it, and it was encompass'd with a Balcony, or rather an Iron-grate.
               On the left hand, there was a door which led into a great and very lightsome Gallery, the
walls whereof were whitened, and the floor cover'd with rich Carpets. On the right hand,
there were, in another apartment, which was Vaulted, eight high Tombs: and it was through
this last Vault, that people pass'd into a third, in which was the Sepulchre of Seid-Ibrahim.
The Tomb was two foot above ground, and was cover'd with a Carpet of yellow Damask. At
the head and feet, as also on both sides, there were several Wax Candles and Lanthorns, upon
great brass Candlesticks, and from the Roof of the Vault there hung certain Lamps. As I came
out of this place, I met with our Minister, who express'd so great a desire to go into it, that I
ventur'd once more to go in along with him; and he went in thither a second time along with
our Physician.
               About two Musket shot from the Village,The Sepulchre of another Saint. on the East-side, there is to be seen, in a Rock,
the Sepulchre of another Saint, which is very sumptuously built. The Persians call the Saint
who is interr'd in that place Tirbabba, and they affirm he was Master to Scid-Ibrahim, who
had so great an Affection, and so particular a Reverence for him, that he made it his request to
God, that he would vouchsafe, that, after his Death, he might be seen in the same posture as he
was wont to put himself into, when he did his Devotions in his Life time; and that accordingly
he is to be seen at this day clad in a grey Garment kneeling, which was his ordinary gesture

when he said his Prayers, while he lived. Which a man need make no great difficulty to believe,
if there may be any credit given to what is affirmed by Camerarius, in his Historical Meditations,
after Varro, and Ammianus Marcellinus, to wit, that the Bodies of the Persians are
not corrupted, and that they are only dry'd up: I am of opinion, that this is to be understood
only of such Bodies as are not interr'd, but expos'd to the Air, nay it is further requisite they
should be Bodies brought very low either by age or sickness: for full Bodies are subject to corruption,
in Persia as well as other places
               These two places are very famous by reason of the Pilgrimages upon which the Persians resort
thither, especially about the time that Tiribabba hath a new Garment bestow'd on him, and
that the old one is torn to pieces, to be distributed among the Pilgrims. The Inhabitants of the
Country relate strange things of the Miracles of these Saints: but in regard they can be no other
than Fables, or the effects of Sorcery, and that the Persians are very apt to believe any stories,
and are very much inclin'd to Sorcery, I thought it more discretion to wave the relation of
their impertinences.
               Upon the door of this Sepulchre, there was this Inscription in Arabick Letters, Alla mufethi
hibebuad, that is to say, O God, open this door. There are cut within the Rock several Chambers,
Neeches, and Holes, in which the Pilgrims are lodg'd and do their Devotions; nay there
are some so high, that they must have Ladders of 12. or 15. foot long to get up to
them.
               There were three of us ventur'd to get up to the top of the Rock by dreadful precipices, helping
one the other as we got up. There we found four spacious Chambers, and, within, several
Neeches cut in the Rock, to serve for Beds. But what we thought most strange was, that we
found in that Vault,Shels in mountains far from the Sea. upon the very top of the Mountain, Muscle-shels, and in some places such
abundance of them, as would induce a man to imagine, that the Rock was made up of sand and
shels. In our return from Persia, we observ'd all along the Caspian Sea, several of these shelly
Mountains. whereof we shall give a further accompt hereafter.
               The Inhabitants of this Village of Pyrmaraas never drink any Wine, out of a fear, as they
say themselves, that, breaking the Laws of Mahomet and the Directions of the Alchoran, the
Holiness of the place might be thereby prophan'd. At the entrance of the Village, near the Sepulchre
of Seid-Ibrahim there is a great Vault, or Cestern of 52. foot in length and twenty in
breadth, compass'd with a wall of Free-stone, which in the Winter time they fill with Water,
Snow and Ice, to be us'd in the great heats and drought of Summer, as well for themselves as
their Cattel.
               The 29. the Chan sent us word, that we might send our Harbinger to Schamachie, to take
up Lodgings for us, and that we might follow him in the afternoon. But after we had loaded
part of our Baggage, and just as we were going to take Horse, the Chan sent an express Messenger
to us, to intreat us to continue that night at Pyrmaraas. And that we might be assur'd, this
was not done out of any design upon us, he sent us several refreshment, and among other
things, four great Pitchers, and two Leathern baggs full of Wine, good store of Pomegranates,
Apples, Pears, Quinces and Chest-nuts, and to each of the Ambassadors an excellent
Horse sadled and bridled.The superstition of the Persians. We could not then imagine what might occasion this delay; but it
was told us afterward, that the Minatzim, or Astrologer, belonging to the Chan, had perswaded
him, that that day was not a fortunate day to receive strangers in.
               The next day,The reception of the Ambassadors at Schamachie. Dec. 30. we left Pyrmaraas, about eight in the Morning, taking our way
straight to Schamachy, into which we made a very noble entrance. Within two leagues of the
City, we met with one afoot, who came to tell us, from the Chan, that we were welcom, and
that he would come out of the City in person to receive us. This man march'd on still in the
front of our Cavalcade. Within a league of the City, we met with about thirty Gentlemen
on horse-back, very well mounted, who came only to take a view of us, and immediately return'd,
in full speed, to the City. After this, we met, near a certain Village, with about a hundred
men on horse-back, who open'd, to make us way to pass through them.
               About two Musket-shot thence we met with another Troop of Cavaliers, among whom
there were tweleve that had a particular Coiffure about their heads, having their Turbants pointed
upwards like the Spire of a Steeple, which they call Takia; and we were told it was by Privilege
that they were so dress'd, it being to signifie that they were of the posterity and kinred
of their Prophet Aaly. These saluted us with a low inclination of the head, and bid us welcome,
by saluting us with their Chosckeldi, in the Turkish Language, which they would rather
speak than the Persian.
               Having kept company with these about half a League, we perceiv'd on our right hand a body
of about 500. men; and whereas we were told, that the Chan and his Calenter, or Lieutenant,
were there in person, it was taken into consideration, whether we should keep on in the Highway,
or turn aside and make-towards them. The Ambassador Brugman would have had us
keep on in the High-way, which led streight to the City, alleging that it was the Chan's duty,
who receiv'd us, and who ought to be his own Master of the Ceremonies, to come to us. But

our Mehemandar, and others of the Company assuring us, that the High-way was very deep
and dirty, and that the fields were more fit for the reception of the Ambassadors, and the Complements
and Ceremonies occasion'd thereby,The Chan of Schamachie meets the Ambassadors. they prevail'd with us, so that we went streight
towards the Chan, who stay'd for us upon a little Hill, and advanc'd towards the Ambassadors,
as soon as he perceiv'd them coming up. He had on his right hand six men, very proper persons,
Arm'd with gilt Bows and Arrows; on his left, as many of his Guard, with their Muskets,
and after him came a very great number of Gentlemen on Horse-back, very well mounted,
and clad in Garments of Brocado, and Mantles and Caps embroider'd with Gold and Silver.
Being come up to us, he would needs do our Nation the greatest honour imaginable, which was
by taking the Ambassadors one after the other by the hand, contrary to the custom of the Persians.
The first Complements over, he commanded Wine to be pour'd into a silver Vessel,
drunk to the Ambassadors, and oblig'd each of them to pledge him twice.
               The Calenter, and Muscovian Poslanick, Alexei Sauinouits, who were about the Chan, bid
us also heartily welcom, and took us by the hand.
               As we march'd along, we had before us our loud Musick, which consisted in Hawboyes,
Timbrels, Cornets, and Tabours, but particularly in a kind of Instrument, called Kerrenai.
These are made somewhat like our Hawboyes, save that they are of Brass, being above eight
foot in length, and at the extremity, above two foot Diameter. There were four of these Instruments,
and those who play'd on them made a halt ever and anon, and stood in a Circle as
our Trumpeters, holding up the end of their Kerrenai to the sky, and making a noise, which
hath not only nothing of harmony in it. but is more like a dreadful howling than any thing of
Musick. There were also common Hawboyes, which they call Surnatzi, and earthen Timbrels,
made like our Butter-pots. Having march'd on a little way in this Company, the Chan
ordered all to make a second halt, that the Ambassadors might drink, causing in the mean time,
a certain Buffoon, or Jeaster, one of those whom they call Tazusch, to make wry-faces, and
shew a thousand postures. He also used Castagnets, and sung very pleasant songs.
               Within a quarter of a League of the City, there was a body or battalion of above two thousand
foot, most Armenians. This battalion consisted of five Regiments, distinguish'd one from
the other by so many Colours, which were fasten'd to the top of a great and long Pole, so as
that it was as much as a man could do to carry one of them. They had their particular musick,
consisting of Pipes and other Instruments, one whereof was very remarkable, and consisted of
two brass Basins, which they struck one against the other. All these people bid us also very
welcome, and express'd their joy at our arrival, some by clapping their hands, others by turning
their Caps about their heads, or flinging them up into the air. There the Governour
commanded a third halt to be made, that the Ambassadors might drink once more. Coming
near the City-Gate, we were entertain'd with another band of musick, consisting of Timbrells.
Hawboyes, Trumpets, and other Instruments, which joyning with those of our Company made
such a noyse as would have drown'd Thunder it self.
               The Chan invited the Ambassadors with the chiefest of their Retinue to Supper, and made
them cross the Court on horse-back, till they came to the Lodgings into which they were to
go; but the Gentlemen, and the rest of the Retinue were oblig'd to alight at the outer Gate.
The floors of all the Chambers were cover'd with very rich Tapistry. The Persians took off
their shooes before they went into the Chambers; which put us to so much the greater trouble,
in that being all, in riding-boots, we durst not venture to go in, till some of the Chans Domesticks
took some of the more forward by the hand and brought them in; without putting us
to the trouble of pulling off our Boots.
               We pass'd through three very fair Chambers, and were brought into a spacious Hall very
sumptuously furnish'd, and hung with excellent pieces of Painting, representing those parts
which are not commonly seen naked. In the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, the cast
of the water representing the form of a Glass. They had set, to cool, all about the Fountain,
several silver Flaggons, and Bottles of Wine; and there were several Tables cover'd with all
sorts of Conserves,Allows them seats; contrary to the custom, The Governour knowing we were not accustomed to sit down after the
Persian way, had caused seats to be made, and the more to oblige the Ambassadors, he sate
down, after our way of sitting, opposite to the Fountain, causing the Ambassadors to sit down
on his right hand, and on his left, but upon the ground, the Calenter or Lieutenant, the Minatschim
or Astrologer, his Physician, and several other persons of Quality. The Gentlemen
and Officers belonging to the Ambassadors sate down on the floor, the other side of the
Hall.
               The Musicians stood before the Chan. At the entrance of the Hall there were several
young men, very handsom persons, having on Garments of Brocado, with their Bows and Arrows
in the posture of shooting. All that were in the Hall, whether sitting or standing, had
their backs to the Wall, and their faces towards the Chan and the company, so as that not one
had his back turn'd to another, according to the ordinary custom, which they observe in all
their Assemblies.
               
                  
There were brought to the Company several little Tables cover'd with Fruits and Conserves,
to be serv'd to two at a time, while two Pages went round the Hall to fill Wine, it being all
they had to do,The services of the Feast. unless it were, when they had ended one round, to begin another. After every
one had eaten some few Conserves, they were taken away, and the like Tables were cover'd
with a very fine Cotton-cloath of several colours, to serve the Meat upon. About an hour after,
the Meat was taken away, and Conserves were served up again, and after that began the
Preparatives for Supper. The little Tables were taken away, that the whole Hall might be
cover'd, upon the Tapistry, with great pieces of Linnen, which were to serve for a kind of
Table-cloath. The Butler having done his duty, the Carver comes in with a great Wooden
Dish full of a certain thin bak'd Past.A strange sort of Napkins. The Persians call it Iucha, and every piece is above three
foot in length, and as many in breadth. He calst one of them to every one of the Company, to
serve instead of a Napkin. That done, the Meat was brought in, in great Pewter Dishes, which
were set in the midst of the Hall, where the Suffretzi, or Carver, kneeling down, cut it into
pieces, and dispos'd it into little Dishes, whereof every one had one brought him.
               All the Guests had every one standing by them a Tulsdan,The neatness of the Persians. or Pot to spet in, made as our
Chamber-pots, save that the mouth is narrower; and they make use of them instead of a Basin
to spet in, as also to put in the bones, parings, and cores of fruits, and other superfluities, which
might injure the Tapistry or the floor.
               We had Musick, while we were at Meal. The Musick consisted of Lutes and Viols, very
poorly plad on; as also of Tabours and Voices, which made a wretched kind of Harmony.
The two Pages who had fill'd the Wine at the Collation, danc'd to the sound of all these Instruments:
so that they seem'd as if they would give us a taste of the delights of the Terrestial Paradise,
aer the hardship we had suffer'd since our coming from Moscou. The Governour's
Palace lyeth upon the ascent of a little Hill, whence might be discover'd all the houses about the
City; and he had commanded all the Inhabitants to set a row of Lamps in their windows,
which represented to our eyes above twenty thousand Stars, enough to dispel the greatest darkness
of the night, and added much to the divertisement, which they endeavoured to give all our
senses, while the Musick of the Hawboyes and Timbrels made all the Rampiers of the City to
resound again.
               The Governour,The Chan an exellent Marksman, desirous to let the Ambassadors see how expert he was in shooting, bid
them observe one of the Lamps that stood near them, to see whether he struck it out with the
first Musket-shot: which he did twice together, without missing any one time. This Feast having
lasted till it was somewhat late in the night, and that we began to think it a little cold, the
Governour carry'd us into another Room with a fire in it,One of the company kills himself with drinking Aquavitae. where he call'd for Conserves, Wine,
and Aquavitae, which the Persians were so greedy of, that one of them, a person of quality,
who never had drunk any before, and would needs do it out of complyance to us, took so much
of it, that the next day he was found dead in his bed.
               After this treatment, which lasted till midnight, the Chan permitted us to withdraw, and
assign'd us Lodging among the Armenians, because they were Christians; but in regard our
Hosts had had no notice of our coming, and that our Baggage was not yet arriv'd, we found
neither Beds, nor Benches, nor Tables, so that after so good a Supper, we had a very ill night
of it.
               The last day of December, the Chan sent the Ambassadors several refreshments, Wine, wild
Fowl, and other Provisions. The Calenter or Lieutenant ordered to be allow'd us for our dayly
Provision, seventeen Sheep, twenty Pullers, a hundred Eggs, a certain quantity of Salt, and
Bread, fifty quarts of Wine, and twenty burthens of Wood. This was very punctually observ'd
for the four or five first dayes; but the Mehemander being oblig'd to get in these Provisions
out of the neighbouring Villages, which he could not so procure but that it was sometimes
three or four dayes ere we could get our allowance, the Chan sent us word, that it were
more for our convenience to send to the Market for our Provisions, and that we might be assur'd,
that what we laid out should be reimburs'd at our departure thence. To that purpose, he
caus'd it to be Proclaim'd by sound of Trumpet, that all Provisions should be sold to the Frenqui
(for so they call the Germans, as well as the French, Italians, and Spaniards) at a reasonable
rate.
               We continu'd three full moneths at Scamachie, expecting orders from the Court for our expence,
and the prosecution of our journey. The Governour and Calenter endeavour'd what they
could, in the mean time, to make this long stay of ours there the less eadious by the continual
entertainments they made us, as also by the divertisements of Hunting, and the Visits they often
gave the Ambassadors, together with the frequent Presents they sent them of Wine, wildfowl,
and fruits.
               
                  M.DC.XXXVII.
                  We began this year with the Ceremonies of the Persian Gentleman's Enterrment, who had

kill'd himself by his excessive drinking of Aquavitae,1637. at the first Entertainment, which the Governour
had given us, the day of our arrival. We shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the
Ceremonies of their Enterrments, and therefore shall give no futher accompt of it here, than
that ordinarily the Bodies are carried into the Metzid, Mosquey or Church, whence they are afterwards
transported to Babylon, Kufa, or Netschef, to be interr'd near their Prophet Aaly,
or near some other of their Imans, or Saints.
                  Ianuary 2. the Governour and the Calenter visited the Ambassadors, and brought along with
them, Conserves and Wine, for the Collation. The Chan's design was, to hear our Musick,
whereof he had heard much talk; and accordingly, he was so taken therewith, that he importun'd
the Ambassadors to go and sup with him at the Castle, and to bring their Musick along
with them. It consisted of a Violin, a Base-Viol, a Bandore, and a Voice. The Ambassadors
would at first have put him off, but his instances were such, that they could not possibly do it;
insomuch that we pass'd away the remainder of that day, in the same Divertisements as he had
entertain'd us with the first day of our arrival. Only there was this extraordinary, that the
Governour ordered to be brought out of the Stable some of his best Horses, to the number of
twenty seven, among which there were three, which the Sophy had sent him, not long before,
as so many assurances of his favour. He caus'd one of the Gentlemen belonging to his Chamber
to mount them all, and to take several turns thereon about the Hall, though the floor were cover'd
with very rich Tapistry.
                  Ian. 5. the Chan sent the Ambassadors word, that if they were desirous to be present,
the next day, at the Ceremonies performed by the Armenians at the Consecration of
their Holy-water, at which he should himself be in person, he would order a particular place
to be kept for them. The Armenians call this feast Chatschae Schuran, that is the Baptism of
the Cross.
                  The Ceremonies are performed without the City,The Armenians bless the Water on Teiday. near a Bridge called Puli Amberi. The
Armenians celebrate this Feast, as do also the Muscovites and some other Christians, upon the
sixth of Ianuary, which is the day of the Epiphany, or appearance of the Star to the Kings or
Wise-men. They began it with a Mass, which was said betimes in the morning before day.
After Mass there was a Sermon preach'd, the former being said in a manner with the same Ceremonies
as the Roman-Catholicks do it in Europe.The Ambassadors, assist at their Service. The Ambassadors, whose Lodgings were
near the Chapel of the Armenians, made no difficuly to be present at both Mass and Sermon;
and after the latter, they were Complemented by the Bishop who had Preach'd it, and who
came purposely for that Exercise, from the place of his ordinary residence.
                  He gave them to understand by an Interpreter, how glad he was to see their Devotions honour'd
by the Presence of Persons of that quality, since it could be no small comfort to them,
to see in their Churches Europaean Christians, who had never come into them before. Whereto
he added, that their Excellencies the Ambassadors knew not who he was, but that he should
find a time to acquaint them therewith: from which Discourse of his we inferr'd, that he was
some Missionary of the Pope's, sent into these parts, to endeavour the Re-union of the Grek
Church with the Roman.
                  He further intreated the Ambassadors, to use their Mediation to the Governour, that they
might be permitted to carry on the building of a Monastery, which the Armenians had begun;
which they promised to do.
                  About noon the Armenians, by order from the Governour, brought us fifteen Horses, upon
which we rode to the River, which is about half a League from the City. Those poor people,
who were come to the City from all the adjacent Villages, went out of it in Procession, with
abundance of Images, Crosses and Banners, guarded to the River-side by a strong part of Soldiers,
which the Governour had assign'd them, for their Protection against the injuries and affronts
of the Mussulmans, or Mahumetans, who make it thier sport to abuse them. The Governour
had caus'd a Tent to be pitch'd over against the place, where the Consecrtion was to
be performed, very richly hung with Tapistry, and had ordered a sumptuous Collation to be
made ready in it. There were on his left hand the Muscovian Poslanick, and a great number of
Gentlemen, and the right he had kept void for the Ambassadors, and some of their retinue.
After he had receiv'd us,The Ceremonies of the Arminians in Consecrating the Water. and made us sit down, he commanded the Armenians to begin their
Ceremonies. As soon as they begun Reading, at the River-side, four men, stark naked, leap'd
into the water, and swum up and down for a certain time, to open the water, which was a
little frozen over. One of our Spaniels, which was wont to go into the water,
leap'd in after them: which found the Persians excellent sport, who look upon
a Dog as so unclean a kind of Creature, that they would not willingly one should touch
them; insomuch that they laugh'd to see the Ceremonies of the Armenians prophan'd by our
Water-Dog; though indeed they look on all those poor people do as so much mummery. Only
the Governour himself makes his advantage thereof, inasmuch as the pains he takes to be present
thereat, and consequently to protect those of that Profession, brings him in yearly a Present
of a thousand Crowns from their Churches.
                  
                     
After the Bishop had read for an hour or better, and the Assembly given over singing and
playing on the Timbrels, he pour'd a little Consecrated Oyl into the Water, into which he
afterwards dipp'd a little Cross beset with abundance of Precious Stones, and at last, holding
his Crosier over the Water, he gave it his Benediction.
                  After that Ceremony, all the Armenians took of it, some to drink, others to wash their
faces withall. There were some among them cast themselves into it, but most took only so
much of it as to sprinkle their faces therewith. Some of the Governours Domesticks made it
their sport to dash the Priests and the Women, nay some were so uncivil with them, that the
Chan himself was asham'd of it, and oblig'd to command them to forbear their rudenesses:
though he himself made his Jester and others of his Servants Dance, purposely to abouse the
Armenians, who Danced about their Bishop. The Governours Physician, who was an Arabian
born, and a person of no Religion, had the Impudence to ask the Ambassadors, what
they thought of Iesus Christ, and whether they believ'd him to be the Son of God. Answer
was made him, that they believ'd him to be the True God, but that it was uncivilly done of
the Physician to laugh at their Religion, and that they were not come thither to dispute it with
him.
                  All the Ceremonies being over, they fell very seriously a-drinking, and the Governour took
his Liquor so liberally, that being well nigh Drunk, he left the Company, and got on Hors-back,
without taking leave of any one. All the rest of the Persians follow'd him; which we
were so much the more surpriz'd at, inasmuch as, not acquainted with their custom, we could
not imagine what should be the reason of his going away: Being got on Horse-back, in order to
our return for the City, we met with the Governour, who staid for the Ambassadors not far
from the Tent. We understood afterwards, and indeed found it by exprience, that the Persians
think it not much, to rise from Table, and go their ways, without making Excuse or Complement
to those by whom they were entertain'd, who for their parts take the same privilege
to do the like with those whom they had invited, when they find themselves in such a condition
as that they are not able to keep them company any longer. Of this we had man instances, during
our aboad in Persia, and that sometimes, at the Schach's own Table.
                  Ianuary 9. the Armenian Bishop gave the Ambassadors a Visit. He came to their Lodgings
with the Cross and Banner, having many Priests marching before him, who were all in their
Pontifical Robes, with Wax-Candles in their hands. As they came into the Court, they fell
a singing and playing on their Timbrels, Hawboies, and little Bells, and brought us a present of
two Pitchers of Wine, and a dish of Apples, in the midst whereof they had planted a Wax-Candle
lighted. They were above three hours in discourse with the Ambassadors, concerning
the business of their Religion, and when they took leave of them, they re-iterated the intreaty
they had made to them before, of employing their intercession to the Governour, for the building
of their Church.
                  Ian. 10. The Calenter, or King's Lieutenant, entertain'd the Ambassadors and all their retinue
at a very great Feast:The Calenter's Feast. but before we sate down, he would needs give us the satisfaction to
see his Palace, which was incomparably both better built and furnish'd than the Governour's.
The Hall, where we were to Dine, was all arched and set out with a certain Plaister-work done
in Leaves and Branches, which argu'd much the Ingenuity of the Inventor. The Hall looked
into a very spacious and very fair Garden; the situation whereof, we thought so much the more
advantageous, in that the Hall being high, and the Garden very low, it might be all seen out
of the Windows thereof. On one side of the Hall there was a Gallery, out of which issu'd a
Fountain, which casting its water at first very high, charm'd us with a low, but delighful noise,
which the water thereof made by falling into another lower Basin opposite to a Chamber under
the Hall, and thence into a third which was in the midst of the Garden. The Governour, who
was also at this entertainment, with the chiefest of his Courtiers, had brought thither along
with him the Marshal of the Sophy's Court, who was then newly come from Ispaban. The
Feast lasted till night, which being somewhat dark the Persians brought us to our Quarters
with Torches: though they themselves were so well furnish'd, as to stand in need of conductors,
at least as much as we did.
                  The 18. of Ianuary,The Ambassadors Presents to the Chan. the Ambassadors sent the Steward of their Houshold, the Secretary of
the Embassy, and the Controller, to the Chan, to make him the ordinary Present, which was,
ten Ells of Scarler, five Ells of blew Satin, a Barrel of Aquavitae, a Chest, or Cellar, in which
they sent him two dozen Bottles of all sorts of Spirits of Wine, and two pair of Knives, the
hafts whereof were of Amber. This Present put him into so good an Humour, that we thought
it a seasonable time,The Governour permits the Armenians to build a Church. to present to him the Petition of the Armenians, concerning the Building
of their Church.
                  In answer to which, he told, us that although, ever since the establishment of the Mahumetan
Religion in Persia, the Christians never were permitted to build a Church at Schamachie, and
that accordingly, it never had been his intention to suffer the Armenians to  any; yet
such was the respect he had for the Intercession of the Ambassadors in their behalf, that they

might assure themselves, he would no longer oppose it: and that they might have no occasion
to doubt his reality herein, he would needs have the Orders for that purpose dispatch'd in
their presence.
                  The Armenians were so over-joy'd thereat, that, not thinking it enough to give the Ambassadors
their humblest thanks, they promised so to order things, that their intended Structure
should acquaint posterity with their Names, and the Good Offices they had done them upon
that occasion.
                  Ian. 20. came back the Courier, or Express, whom the Chan had sent to Ispahan, even before
we left Niasabath; upon which the Ambassadors sent to him, to desire him to communicate
to them the Orders of the Court, concerning the prosecution of their Journey. Answer
was made us, that he had not receiv'd any new Orders at all, and that, if we desired it, we
might hear the Letter read, which he thereupon gave his Physician to read. The Physician, a
person the fittest in the World to represent a Fool in a play, after he had kiss'd the Letter, put
it to his forehead, and at last read it. The Contents of it, at least what he read, was to this
effect; That the Express from the Sulthan of Derbent being come to the Court, before him
whom the Chan of Schamachie had sent, all the account he had brought, was, that there was
arriv'd at Derbent any Envoy, or Poslanick, from the Great Duke of Muscovy, who had reported,
that, within a few days, there would come into those parts certain Ambassadors from
one of the Princes of Germany: That the Schach, who had receiv'd no other accompt of their
arrival, thought it enough to order the Governour of Derbent to receive them, to entertain
then kindly, during the stay they should make there, and to supply them with all things for
the continuation of their journey, as far as Schamachie, and that when they were come thither,
the Chan of Schamachie should send an Express to give an accompt thereof to the
Court, from which he should immediately receive orders what to do, as well in respect of the
maintenance of the Ambassadors, as their departure thence. The Chan demanded of us a Catalogue
of the names and qualities of all of our Retinue; nay, he would have had it express'd in
the said Catalogue, what Professions they were of, and that we should not fail setting down,
that we had among us a Physician, a Chyrurgeon, a Painter, and Musicians; which we would
not do; but thought it sufficient, to give them, in writing, only the names of our people, and
the Offices, and employments they were in, upon the accompt of the Embassy. We had a
great suspicion that the said Letter came not from the Court, and that there was somewhat
more or less in it, and the more to be assur'd of it, we got the Courier to come the next day
to our quarters. The Wine we gave him, and the small Presents which were secretly made
him, unlock'd the man's breast, and drew out the whole secret. He told us, upon promise of
secrecy, that the Governours Brother, having been, not long before executed, and that misfortune
having, in some measure, engag'd the whole Family in the disgrace of the deceas'd, there
was not any man durst undertake the delivery of his Letter to the Sophy, as being ignorant what
the contents thereof might be: but that after a moneths delay, one of the Kings Chamberlains having
ventured to lay it at his Majesties feet, the Sofi would make no answer at all thereto, but
ordered another to write to him, and sent him word, that there was no answer to be made to
his Letter, by reason of the orders sent to the Sulthan of Derbent, which were contain'd in the
Letter,The Schach orders for the Ambassadors. whereof we had heard the reading. That it was not thought fit to add any thing thereto,
but an express command to the Governour, to see cut to pieces in his presence all those Persians
that durst affront or injure the Germans, during the stay they should make in his Government.
So that we were forc'd to stay there, in expectation of what orders the Sophy
should send, upon the Dispatches, which the Chan was then sending to the Court by an Express.
                  Ian. 25. the Governour accompany'd by the Poslanick, and a great number of Courtiers,
gave the Ambassadors a Visit; but in regard their Lent was already begun he would
not participate of our Collation, and so having heard our Musick, he return'd to his own
Palace.
                  Ian. 28. The Muscovian Poslanick went for Ispahan, not well satisfy'd with the treatment he
had receiv'd from the Governour and Calenter.The Muscovian Envoy leaves Schamachie. All the revenge he could take was upon the
Mehemander, who had been assign'd to Conduct him, taking any occasion to affront and abuse
him. Some of our Retinue accompany'd him a League out of the City, where they took
leave of him.
                  February the fifth,FEBRU. walking abroad with some of our company, we went into a great house
near the Market-place,A College for the instruction of Youth. which they call Basar. It was a very noble Structure, having many
Galleries and Chambers, like a College. Meeting up and down with several persons, some antient,
some young, some walking, some sitting, with books in their hands, we had the curiosity
to enquire what place it was, and found that it was a School or College, which they called Mandresa,
of which kind there are very many all over Persia.
                  While we were viewing the Structure, one of their Maderis, or Regents, who read publick
Lectures, intreated us to come near him, and perceiving that I had caus'd to be graven upon a

Cane I walk'd with all these words in Arabick,1637. Bismi alla, rahman rachim, that is, in the name
of the merciful God who sheweth mercy (a sentence which the Persians put at the beginning of
their writings) he desired me to bestow it on him, upon a promise that he would give me a
better the next day: but finding I made some difficulty to part with it, he cut out the word alla,
which in their Language is the proper name of God, and put what he had cut off in a piece of
clean paper, very gently and carefully, and told me, the name of God ought not to be written
upon a walking stick, which was many times thrust into the dirt.
                  The next day I went again to the same College, whether I had caus'd to be brought along
with me a very fair Celestial Globe, but, by mistake, I went to another School, where nevertheless
they receiv'd me very kindly. The Professors and Regents, as also the Students, very
much wondred to see me come with so noble a Globe, and to understand thereby, that Astrology
and the Mathematicks were better taught among us than in Persia, where they are not yet
acquainted with the invention of Globes, and make use only of the Astrolabe, for the instruction
of their Students. They took much delight in viewing my Globe, and they
nam'd to me in the Arabian Language all the Signs of the Zodiack, nay, gave me to understand
further, that they knew all the names, and all the significations of most of the other
Stars.
                  Another day,A School for Children. I went into a Metzid, or Church, in that part of the Town where we were
quarter'd, to see, how they instructed their Children. They were all sate against the Wall,
excepting only the Molla, or Master of the School, who, with some other aged persons, sate
in the midst of the Hall. As soon as they saw me coming in, they invited me to sit down by
them. The Molla, who had an Alchoran in his hand, very fairly written, suffered me to
turn it over awhile, which when I had done, he took it back from me, kiss'd it, at the begginning,
and would have given it me to kiss also: but I only kiss'd another book I had in my hand,
and told him, that, knowing well what book I had my self, I made no difficulty to kiss it, but
not understanding what was contained in his book, I should not be too forward to honour it so
much. He laugh'd and told me I had done very well. There was among them an Arabian named
Chalil, who was a Minatsim, or Astrologer, born at Hetsa, near Meca, aged about 65.
years. He understood Astrology, and read Enclid to some of his Disciples. I presently knew
the book by the figures in it, and made him some demonstations, as well as I could express my
self in the Persian Language: whereat the good old man was so much pleas'd, that desirous, on
his part, to shew me what he could do, he took out of his bosom a little brass Astrolabe, and
ask'd me, whether I had ever seen the like, or understood the use of it. Whereto having answer'd
him, that I understood it very well, and that I had one at my Lodging, he seem'd to be
very desirous to see it, which oblig'd me to go home to fetch it, and to bring along with me the
Globe, which they wondred very much to see, especially when they understood that I had made
it my self. The honest Arabian desir'd me to shew him, how I could set down the Degrees so exactly,
in regard they have no Instruments wherewith to make their Circles and Degrees. I
shew'd him the invention of it, and how in a short time, and with little trouble he might attain
thereto, for which discovery, he acknowledg'd himself very much oblig'd to me, insomuch that
ever after, he let slipno occasion, whereby he might assure me of his friendship, expressing it as
well by his frequent visits, coming one day with abundance of excellent fruit, and dishes of meat
ready dress'd purposely to Dine with me at his own charges, as by his earnest proffers of all the
service that lay in his power. He gave me the Longitudes and Latitudes of the chiefest Cities
and places of all Asia, which I compared with the observations I had my self made thereof, and
found them very exact.
                  The Molla, or Master of the Metzid, was called Maheb Aaly, and was a very young, but
mighty good natur'd man, and of an excellent humour, one who did all that lay in his power to
serve me, doing me the greatest kindnesses he could upon all occasions, especially in my study of
the Arabian Tongue. He brought me also acquainted with a certain friend of his, named Imanculi,
who was an Ohnbaschi, or Captain of a Troop of Horse. These two came to see me every
day alternately, as well to teach me their Language as to learn mine. Which they did with
very great improvement dayly, especially Imanculi, who no doubt had in a short time arriv'd
to the perfection of it, had it not been for the envy or jealousie of some of our own, which
prov'd so great, as to make it suspected, that those poor people had some design to change their
Religion: so that they were forc'd to keep out of the way, and for the most part to make their
visits in the night. Insomuch that one day, to wit, Febr. 11. being gone to the Metzid, to
take a Lesson in the Language, there came thither a Persian servant, to tell the Molla, from the
Governour, that he much wondred, how he durst suffer those Christians to come into their
Temple, that they had nothing to do there, and that it was his best course to dismiss them. The
Molla was, at first, a little startled thereat, but upon second thoughts, considering with himself,
that the Persians are never forbidden the company or conversation of Christians, he doubted
this was some trick put upon him; and having taken the servant aside, he understood from
him, that it was not the Chan, but our Interpreter who had sent him, to hinder my study of

the Language. The next day, we had such another Message sent us; but we knew before both
the Author and occasion of it, and therefore made no accompt thereof. Some time after, there
hapning some difference between the Ambassador Brugman, and our Interpreter, he acknowledg'd,
that it was by order from his Excellency, that he had sent the said servant, to hinder my
learning of the Language. Upon the same accompt was it that the said Ambassador ordered me
to reduce Persia and Turkie into one Map, that so I might be taken off the study of the Language,
at least as long as I should be employ'd about that teadious and troublesome piece of
work.
                  Febr. 7.An Augustine Monk visits the Ambassadors. the Ambassadors were visited by a Monk, a Roman Catholick, named Ambrosio dos
Anios, born at Lisbon in Portugal. The accompt he gave of himself, was, that he came from
Tiflis in Georgia, which lies about ten dayes journey from Scanachie, where he was Prior of a
Monastery of the Order of St. Augustin, and that he had undertaken that journey out of no
other design, than upon the news he had heard, that a Potent Prince of Germany had sent a solemn
Embassy into Persia, and that he could not imagine, it should be upon any accompt so
much as the advancement of Christian Religion in those parts: That he had been the more willing
to be at the trouble of that journey, out of the hope he had, that their Excellencies the Ambassadors,
would not take it ill that he had taken the freedom to wait on them; not only to
congratulate their happy arrival in Persia, but also to serve them in any thing lay in his power:
That he had been seven and twenty years in the Kingdom, and that during so long a Tract of
time, he had not been so negligent in inquiring into the affairs of the Countrey, and the humour
of the Nation, as that he might not be in some measure serviceable to them in their Negotiation.
                  We knew not, upon the first proposal, what to imagine of the intentions of this Religious
Man, and therefore we thought fit to stand as it were upon our Guard, till that after ten dayes
conversation with him, we really found him sincere in all his proceedings, insomuch that we
made no difficulty to trust him absolutely in all things. Besides the Portuguez, which was his
Mother-Tongue, and the Latine, in which he entertrain'd the Ambassadors, he understood also
the Georgian, the Turkish, and the Persian Languages, for the attaining of which last, he gave
me many excellent directions.
                  About this time, many of our people were troubled with burning Feavers, which was a consequence
of their abundant drinking of Wine, after the much VVater they had been forc'd to
drink before. The VVine of Persia is very good, but strong, and our people drunk so freely
of it, that the Ambassadors were forc'd to forbid the use thereof by a very strict order. There
were two and twenty of them kept their Beds at the same time, but by Gods mercy, and through
the extraordinary care of the Physician, not one dyed.
                  The same day,A Feast in memory of Haly. which is, according to the accompt of the Persians, the 21. day of Ramesan,
they celebrated their Auschur, or solemn Feast, in memory of Haly, their great Saint and Patron.
The Ceremonies and Devotions were performed in a House built for that purpose, without
the City. The Governour, his Calenter, and the other chief Officers, were in a Gallery of
the said House, and opposite to the Gallery, there was an open Chair, about eight foot high,
which was plac'd under a piece of Linnen Cloath which had been pitch'd there,A Persian Priest pleasantly dress'd. for the convenience
of the Chatib, that is, their Prelate, who sat in the said Chair, clad in a blew Garment,
which is the Mourning-Colour of that Country. He spent above two hours in reading in a
Book, which they call Machtelnama, containing the Life and Actions of Haly, singing with a
loud and dolefull, yet clear and intelligible Voice, and that without any intermission, unless it
were when he came to some remarkable Passage, or some Moral Sentence, whereof he only
said the first Word, leaving the rest to be sung out by the other Priests, whereof there stood a
great number about the Chair. One of those Priests cry'd out at the end of every passage, Luanet
Chudai ber kuschendi Aaly bad, that is, Gods Curse be on him who kill'd Haly: whereto the
whole Assembly answer'd, bisch bad kem bad, that is, rather more than less. When he comes
to the passage where Haly said to his Children, (there are some believe he was well skill'd in
Judiciary Astrology, and that he fore-saw his own Death) that he should not live long, and
that it would not be long ere he were kill'd by one of his Domesticks, discovering it should be
Abdurraman ibni Meltzem, upon which the Children, with tears in their eyes, intreat him,
to be carefull of his Person, and rather to prevent Abdurraman, then suffer them, upon his
Death, to become Orphans, destitute of all Comfort, and expos'd to the discretion of their Enemies;
when the Chathib, I say, comes to this place, you shall see the Persians weep and sob
most bitterly; as they do also when the Chathib represents how Haly was kill'd in their Metzid,
as he was at Prayers,A Procession. and the desolate condition his Children were in upon his Death. When
the Chathib hath given over Reading, the Chan sends him a Garment of Silk, which he immediately
puts on, and then there were conducted, in Procession, three Camels carrying Coffins,
cover'd with black Cloath, to represent those of Haly, and his two Sons, Hassan and Hossein.
After that follow'd two Chests cover'd with blew Cloath, in which were the Books and spiritual
Treatises written by Haly. Then came two excellent Horses, having at the Pommel of

the Saddles, andupon the Saddles, several Bows, Arrows, Turbants, and Flaggs. After them
march'd one man alone, carrying upon the top of a long pole a kind of Tower or Steeple, in
which there were thrust four Cimiters, but they were cover'd with so many Ribbons, and other
Toyes, that they could hardly be perceived: and at last many men carrying on their Heads
little Boxes cover'd with Feathers, and Flowers of several colours, in which the Alchoran lay
open.
                  These last Danc'd and Leap'd, in cadence to a certain dolefull Musick of Hawboyes, Timbrels,
Flageolets and Tabors. On the other side, many young Boyes Danc'd and Sung together,
clapping one another upon the shoulders, and crying Heder, Heder, which is the name of Haly,
Hassan, Hossein; and with these Ceremonies they took their way towards the City. Upon
this day the Death of Haly is celebrated all over Persia: but Mahomet, their great Prophet,
hath no particular Festival.
                  The 14. of February, was the new Moon, at which ends the Lent of the Persians, which began
the 16. of Ianuary, which according to their accompt is the first of Ramesan; but in regard
it was the eve of their Sabbath,The Ambassadors treated by the Chan. which is Friday, their Ecclesiasticks thought fit to continue
the Fast till that day. The next day after the Feast, the Chan made a great Entertainment
for all the Grandees of his Court, to which he invited also the Ambassadors with their retinue,
and treated them very Magnificently.
                  The 27.An order from the Court for their departure. came back the Courrier, whom the Chan had dispatch'd thence ever since the 21.
with express orders for our departure, with the first convenience, for Ispahan. This good news
put some of us into an humour to go a Hunting. The Governour lent us his excuses, that, some
business of importance intervening, he could not go along with us; however, he sent us his
Huntsmen, his Hounds, and his Hawks; as also a Leopard, which, being Excellently well
taught, started with as much swiftness as a Grey-hound, and gave us all the satisfaction Hunting
could afford. He discover'd no Hare which he took not, and came on at the least call, with
more command than any Setting Dog, leaping up behind the person who had the ordering of
him. The Chan had in the mean time caus'd a sumptuous Collation to be made ready for us in
his own Garden, without the City; but the person he had sent to invite us to pass that way,
mist the Company, and overtook us not till we were coming into the City; so that it being too
great a trouble for us to go then back again, he sent to our quarters some part of the Meat
which had been prepared for our Entertainment.
                  The first of March,MARCH which according to their Almanack, called by them Taguim, is the fourteenth
of Scheual, the Persians celebrated another Feast, which they call Chummehater, in memory
of the day, on which Haly took possession of the Estate of his Cousin and Father-in-law
Mahomet. The Chan treated us again this day very Magnificently, near the River under a
Tent, where, during the time of the Entertainment, he gave us the Divertisements of several
sorts of Dances, and among others that of a Youth of about twenty years of age, who Danc'd
to the Musick of two little Cimbals, which he himself play'd on excellently well; as also that
of a Moor, or black Arabian, who leap'd and danc'd between the Porcelane Dishes, wherein
the Meat had been brought up, with such exactness, that he broke not one. Nay, as it should
seem, all the people were willing to contribute to our Divertisement, by the publick Acclamations
which fill'd every street: And the Chan himself would needs give us another tryal of his
skill at the Bow. He told us that heretofore he had cut a Hair with his Arrow, at a considerable
distance, and that he would try, whether he could do as much at the age he was of then,
which was forty five years. Having therefore fasten'd to a Horses hair one of those Rings,
which the Persians make use of to bend their Bows, and commonly wear them upon their
Thumbs, and having caus'd the Boy that held it to stand at the distance of above six paces, he
cut it twice one after another with his Arrow. He also, with a Fire-lock, shot an Apple, which
he had caus'd to be cast into the Air.
                  In our return to the City, after an Entertainment which had lasted six hours, all the Officers
took occasion, in a spacious plain, to give us a Tryal of the swiftness of their Horses. I must
needs confess it is extraordinary, and that there is no English Horse comes near them: but it is
certain withall, that this is all they teach them. They also gave us the Divertisement of their
Engagements or Horse-back, and their manner of Skirmishing with their enemies, and shew'd
us an incredible and miraculous Activity, not only in casting their Switches, which, in that Exercise,
they made use of instead of Javelins, Riding with full speed upon those whom they
pursu'd, but also in catching them in their hands when they were cast at them, and immediately
Darting them at the pursuers. Of all those engag'd in that Exercise, the Chan's Master of the
Horse behav'd himself the best, and had bestow'd on him by way of recompence, one of the best
Horses out of his Master's Stable.
                  The third of March,Another Festival. the Persians celebrated another Feast, which they call Tzar Schembesur,
that is, the fourth sad Sabbath, and it is the next Wednesday before the Vernal Equinox,
by which they begin their year; of which they are perswaded, that this Wednesday is the most
unfortunate day. And this, they say, they know not only by Tradition, but also by Experience,

which hath discover'd to them, that there never happen'd any thing but misfortune to them that
day. Thence it comes, that they do not any business that day, they keep their Shops shut,
Swear not, nor make any Debauches; but above all things, take they an especial care, not to
pay away any Money that day, out of a fear, they should be oblig'd not to do any thing else
all the year after. There are some who spend the whole day in telling what Money they have
in their Houses: others go, without speaking a word by the way, to the River, for some water,
wherewith they sprinkle their Houses and Houshold-stuff, thinking by that means to divert
the misfortune which might befall them. If they meet with any one of their acquaintance,
as they return home-wards, they cast some water into his face with their hands, or haply, pour
the whole Pitcher full upon him: but this is a kindness they do only to their best friends, out of
a perswasion, that those who are so served, and have their Cloaths all wet, cannot fail being
happy all the year after. Young people that are not Married, find also their Divertisement at
this solemnity, which is, to walk up and down the Streets, or along the River side, playing
upon certain Timbrels of bak'd Earth, which they carry under their arms. Others carry great
Staves in their hands, and go up to their knees in the River, to dash those who come to fetch
water, either by casting it at them with their hands, or taking hold of them, to wet them, or
to rub their faces with the borders of their wet Garments, or haply they break the pitchers
with their Staves. These last are look'd upon as ill-presaging Birds, so that those who can
keep out of their clutches, think they have avoided many misfortunes that should have happened
to them that year. Upon which accompt it is, that there are some, who to avoid meeting
with them, go and fetch in their water before day: but all these fopperies are done only in the
morning, for as soon as it is afternoon, they go a walking, and bestow the time in any of
their other ordinary Exercises. The Author of the Preface before the High-Dutch Translation
of the Kalusthan, says, that this Festival is Dedicated to Saint Iohn Baptist, and that it is in Commemoration
of his Baptism, that the Persians do all those Ceremonies. True it is indeed, that
the Persians have a certain Veneration for that Saint, and that they go, to this day, upon Pilgrimage
to his Sepulchre at Damas, and it may be, that was the intention of him who instituted
this Feast; but now, there is no track to be seen of any such thing.
                  March the tenth,The first day of the Year. that is, the 20. according to our stile, (for the Author means in all places
the old) they celebrated the first day of their year, which they call Nauras, with great
solemnity. For though they commonly count their years from the Hegira, or the day of Mahomet's
flight, from Meca to Medina, which is their Epoche, and co-incident with the 16
of Iuly,Which consists of 12, Lunar moneths. according to our Almanacks; yet so it is, that, their year, consisting only of twelve
Lunar moneths, and consequently being eleven days shorter than ours, they take a certain day
for the beginning of their year, which is that, on which the Sun enters Aries, at the Vernal
Equinox, in what quarter of the Moon soever it happens; but of this we shall give a further
accompt elsewhere.
                  The Ambassadors sent some of us to the Castle to complement the Chan upon the beginning
of the new year, and to wish him a good one. We found him at Table, having near him
the Minatzim, or Astrologer, who rose up ever and anon, and taking his Astrolabe, went to
observe the Sun, and at the very moment that the Sun came to the Equator, he publish'd the
new year, the beginning whereof was celebrated by the firing of some great Guns, both from
the Castle and the City-Walls, and at the same time, there might be heard a Musick of all
sorts of instruments. Opposite to the Chan sat one of their Orators, whom they call Kasiechuan,
who made an Oration, intermixt with more Faces and Gestures than any Player can shew on
the Stage, speaking only of the Victories obtained by the Kings of Persia over the Turks, the
Vsbeques, and other enemies of that Nation. The remainder of the day was merrily spent in
Eating and Drinking, whereof we, who were sent upon the Complement, participated sufficiently,
for the Chan would needs oblige us to sit down at Table with him. The Festival lasted
till the next day, and then the Chan made a great Entertainment for the Ambassadors, whereto
he invited also the Monk I spoke of before.
                  March 20. the Chan and the Calenter came to see the Ambassadors. They were both gotten
sufficiently Drunk, and the occasion of their Visit was this, that the Chan being to take a
Journey (as he would make us believe) and not likely to return before our departure thence,
he came to tell us, that he thought it unhandsome to go without taking leave of the Ambassadors.
He brought along with him his Hakim, or Physician, who had also some smattering in
Astrology, as most of that Profession have. His Hakim told him, after he had observ'd the
Sky a while, that the Stars signify'd it was an unfortunate hour to go into the Lodgings of the
Ambassadors, and upon that Prediction, they sat down in the Court and fell a-drinking. The
Chan having taken notice of one of the Ambassador Crusius's Pages, a beautiful and well-timbred
Lad, he desir'd him to come near him; which when he had, addressing his speech to the
Physician, he ask'd him, whether he did not think him a fine Boy, and wish'd he had been his
his own Son. The Physician, having taken another view of the Heavens, though the Air were
not very clear, and that it was not near night, made answer, that if, after he had earnestly

view'd the Boy, and by that means Imprinted an Idea of him in his imagination, he went and
lay with a Woman, he would certainly get as handsome a Boy as that was. This the Chan and
his Company believ'd as an Oracle; insomuch, that having for some time well considered the
Page, he got on Horse-back and departed.
                  There was at Schamachie a Persian slave, named Faruch, who being a Muscovite by Birth,
had been stollen and sold into Persia, where he had been circumcis'd, while he was yet very
young. He delighted much to be among us, because there were in our retinue some persons
who could talk with him in his own Language: insomuch that being, by his often coming to
our quarters, grown familiar with some, he came one day to tell us, that we should have a care
of our Persian Interpreter,Our Persian Interpreter proves a Renegade. whose name was George Rustan; for, to his knowledge, he had written
to some of his Friends at Ispahan, to this effect; That, though he had liv'd a long time among
Christians, yet were they not to inferr thence, that he had abjur'd the Mahumetane Religion;
but that he should ere long be with them, to give them further assurances of the contrary.
Rustan was a Persian born, and had, not many years before, travell'd into England,
where he had been Baptiz'd. Some years after, he went into Muscovy, where we found him,
in the English Residents retinue, who was his God-father; and coming to hear that we were
to go into Persia, he made so many friends, and was so importunate with the Resident, that
at last, we gave him leave to go along with us as an Interpreter. Yet was he not receiv'd into our
retinue, till he had oblig'd himself by a Writing under his hand, to come back with us, and
by many solemn protestations assured us, that his going along with us was out of no other design,
than to look after and receive what was due to him of his Patrimony, that he might have
somewhat to Trade withal as a Merchant at his return. Accordingly, we were no sooner come
to Ardebil, but we found the truth of what we had been told by Faruch: for, Rustan, as
soon as he was got to a place, where he might expiate his pretended sin, and declare himself
with safety, he went to the Sepulchre of their great Saint, Schich-Sefi, where he did his Devotions
as a right Mahumetane: which that he had done, he got a formal Certificate. We
secur'd him at Ispachan, but he made his escape, and got into the Sanctuary, which they call
Alla-Capi. That done, he cast himself at the feet of the King, and the Seter, or Chief of their
Sect, express'd his repentance in tears, begg'd Pardon, put himself under the Kings protection,
and remain'd in Persia.
                  March the 22. Father Ambrosio took leave of us, being to return to his Monastery
at Tiflis.
                  March 24. the Chan sent away the New-years gifts, which the Governours are wont to
send the King at the beginning of the year, and which were at this time so much the greater, by
how much the disgrace and death of his Brother impos'd upon him a necessity of Courting the
Kings favour. The Present consisted in a certain number of excellent Horses, richly Harness'd,
several Camels loaden with Russia Leather, several rich Stuffs, and thirty bags full of Swan's
down: but what augmented the value of this rich Present, was a great number of handsome
Boys and Girls, whom he sent along with it. The Chan went himself out of the City, with an
intention, as was given out, to conduct the Present two or three leagues: but he returned not,
leaving, by that means, upon the Calenter, the trouble of providing all things for the prosecution
of our Journey. Immediately after the Chan's departure, there was sent to our quarters
the sum of sixty Tumains, which amount to about a thousand Crowns, by way of re-embursement
for the charges we had been at during our stay at Schamachie.
                  But, in regard it amounted not to one half of what we might expect, according to the allowance
which was assign'd us at our arrival,The Ambassadors re-embursed their expence. the Ambassador Brugman, sending us to the Calenter
about other business, charged us to ask him by the way, whether it were upon any order
from the King, or out of the Governours kindness towards us, that the said sum had been
sent us, and to let him know, that though it was not the intention of the Ambassadors to receive
any money, yet since the Calenter had sent it under his own Seal, they would carry it so
seal'd to Ispahan: That they could not forbear complaining of the injury had been done them
in keeping them there so long, contrary to the orders they had received from Court, to take the
speediest course they could for their departure.
                  The Calenter made answer, that it lay not upon him to maintain the Ambassadors, and to furnish
them with money: That it was not to him their Master had sent them, but to the King, and
that it was accordingly by his Majesty's appointment, that he had sent the foresaid sum: That
he could not hinder them from making their complaints, but that they should advantage themselves
nothing thereby: That, for the clearing of himself, he would produce their acquittance
at the Court, and that the Chan and himself had supply'd them out of their own, till the Kings
Order was brought them: That he was much troubled at the inconveniences which the Ambassadors
had been put to, during the long stay they had made in that City, but that it was not their
fault, since it had been impossible, in so short a time, to get Horses and Wagons enough, for so
many people, and so much Baggage, intreating us, ere we went away, to honour him so far as
to Dine with him once more, which we did.
                  
                     
                      March the 27. there were brought us sixty Wagons for the Baggage, and for the conveyance
of some of the Retinue who were sick, or not able to ride, and a hundred and twenty
Sadle-Nags. We sent away our Steward with all the Baggage that night.
                  But ere we take our leave quite of a place where we had sojourn'd so long,Scamachie described??? it will not be
amiss to give here a short accompt of the City of Scamachie. Father Bizarrus, in his History
of Persia, and Ioseph Barbaro, in his Travels, call it sometimes Summachia, sometimes Sumachia,
or Samachia, and the Spaniards write it Xamachi. Some Geographers place it in their
Maps below Derbent, others place it above, and there are also some who put it in twice, for
fear of failing. Its true name, according to the pronunciation of the Persians, is Scamachie, and
it lies forty German Leagues, or six great dayes journey from Derbent: it being suppos'd a
man takes the Mountain way, which is very much about. For if a man goa-foot, or on horse-back
along the Caspian Sea, by the City of Bakuje, and the Mountain Lahatz, where the King
hath a place for the receipt of customs upon forein Commodities, he may easily travel it in two
dayes. The Camels ordinarily take the latter way, and perform their journey in four or five,
and at most in six or seven dayes, according to the burthen they carry. Scamachie is the chief
City of that noble Province, which the antients called Media Atropatia, or Media Minor,
and which is now called Schiruan; which is the more to be observ'd, in respect of their mistake,
who place this City in Hyrcania. It lies at thirty four degrees, forty minutes longitude,
and at forty degrees, fifty minutes latitude, in a valley between two Mountains, which hide it
so, as that it is hardly seen till a man comes to the very Gate. The Persians affirm, it was
built by Schiruan Schach, and that it was heretofore much larger than it is now, since there
were in it five thousand houses. It was destroy'd by the Turks in the time of King Abas, who
perceiving the Emperour of the Turks took in only the strongest places, thereby to secure his
Conquests, and minded not open places, and considering withall, that so many strong and fortify'd
places were rather a burthen than an advantage to him, and being in the midst of his Kingdom
were hard to keep, ordered the pulling down of the Walls on the South-side of the City,
where they were strongest. He took the same course with the Cities of Tauris, Nachtzuan,
Kentza, &c.
                  This South-part of Scamachie makes as  were a City by it self, as being divided from the
North-part, which is still compass'd with a strong Wall, by a little plain, which serves for a
common Market-place to both. The Persians affirm, that the Grand Seigneur having taken the
City of Scamachie, took the stones from all the Sepulchres, and therewith repair'd the Walls
of it. The North-side of the City lies at the foot of a little Mountain, and is somewhat, but
not much bigger than the other, containing but about nine hundred houses. It hath but a poor
Wall about it, which being but low, and having but a wretched Ditch, hinders not but that a man
may come into the City at any time.Its streets and houses. Its Inhabitants, their Language, &c. The City hath five Gates; its streets are narrow, and the
houses low, and most built of Mortar and Earth. There are very few of Brick, or Free-stone.
The Inhabitants are partly Armenians, partly Georgians: who have each their particular Language,
so as that they would not understand one another, if they did not make use of the Turkish,
which is common to both, not only in Schiruan, but also all over Persia. Their greatest
Commerce lies in Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, whereof there are such quantities made, that Women,
nay, very Children make a shift to get their living there, by spinning and preparing the
Silk and Cotton for the work-men. Most of their shops are in the South-part of the City,
where there is also a Basar, or Market-place, into which abutt many streets, which are all covered,
for the convenience of the Merchants. Not far from this Market-place, there are two
Store-houses, containing many Chambers and Galleries, for the entertainment of forein Merchants,
who sell by whole-sale, and for the disposal of their Merchandises. One is called Schach
Caravansera, and is the place appointed for the Muscovites, who bring thither Tin, Russia
Leather, Copper, Furrs, and other Commodities. The other, which is called Losgi Caravansera,
was built for the Tartars of Circassia, who do not bring their Commodities thither, but
lead them, they being only Horses, Women, young Lads, and handsom Maids, wherewith
they Trade among themselves in their own Countrey, where they steal them upon the Frontiers
of Muscovy. The Iews, who have also some part of this latter Store-house assign'd them,
upon this accompt, that the Muscovites will not admit them into their Company, bring thither,
from Tabefferahn, the best Woollen Tapistry in the whole Countrey, whereof there is
brought into Europe but the refuse. Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, nay, Gold and Silver Brocadoes,
as also Bows, Arrows, and Cymitars, are sold there at a very reasonable rate.
                  In our return from Persia, the Muscovian Envoy Alexei Savinouits woulds needs go into the
Storehouse belonging to the Tartars, & being a person of a pleasant humour, he fell a cheapning
of a Boy, about fifteen or sixteen years of age, who was handsom enough, and ask'd the Tartar
what price he set him at, who made answer, he should have him for a hundred Crowns. Alexei,
who had no mind to buy, proffer'd him two and thirty; but the Tartar laugh'd at him, and giving
the Boy a clap upon the buttocks, told the Muscovite, that that very part of him was
worth more.
                  
                     
There are also in the City three Hamams, that is, Baths, or publick Stoves, the use whereof
is as ordinary in Persia as Muscovy. There are two which are common to both men and women,
but with this distinction, that the women go in only in the day-time, and the men in the
night. The third which they call Hamam Schach is only for the men. Hard by this third Bath
there are two great Trees, for which the Persians have a great Veneration, as having been
planted by one of their Saints, named Schich-Marith, who is interr'd not far thence, in a
Metzid, or Church, where there are greater Devotions done than in other Metzids about
the City, wherein there are six in all. The Revenue of this Bath is spent in Luminaries, Cloaths,
and other things necessary about the holy Sepulchre.
                  The Chan,The Chan's charge. or Governour of the City of Scamachie, hath also the command of the whole
Province, joyntly with the Calenter, or King's Lieutenant. The Governour is entrusted with
the Administration of Justice, as also the disposal of things Civil and Military, upon which last
accompt, he is oblig'd to maintain a thousand men, out of the Revenue of his Government, and
to be in a readiness to march, upon the first order he receives to that purpose. The Kings Lieutenant
hath the oversight of his Revenue, and disposes of the Crown-Lands, but is not oblig'd
to go to the Wars: on the contrary he is left in the Province, whereof he hath the sole command
during the absence of the other. The Chan's name was Areb, and he kept a very noble
Court, though he were a person of very low extraction, son to a Peasant of the Village of Scerab,
between Tauris and Ardebil: but the lowness of his extraction was recompens'd in the
great endowments he was Master of. The Persians are very indifferent as to a man's birth, provided
he be otherwise a person of courage and worth, and Areb had much of both, and had acquir'd
so great reputation by his valour, that Schach-Sefi made him Controller of his Ordinance,
when he besieg'd Eruan, which the Turks had taken from the Persians. He discharg'd that trust
so well, and in all other things answer'd the opinion the King had conceived of him, that he bestow'd
on him then the Government of Scamachie, which became vacant by the death of Terruch-Chan,
who was kill'd in the siege we spoke of before. Areb took no small pleasure in
shewing us the wounds he had receiv'd in that War, and in telling us how many Turks heads he
had brought to his King, who sent him continually upon parties and forlorns, against the Army,
which was coming to relieve that place.
                  The Governour and his Lieutenant had both very gracefull and bold aspects, and with that
all the requisite qualities in Commanders, save that they were both so addicted to Wine, that
they were seldom met fasting: but the Governour had still this advantage over his Lieutenant,
that he was more apt to be overcome by it than the other.
                  I may boldly and truly say, that, in all this City, I found not the least track of Antiquity.
For, though I took abundance of pains to find out that great Tower, whereof Iohn Cartwright
an English Gentleman, speaks, in the relation of his Travels into Persia, where he sayes it is built
of Flint and Free-stone, and that they have thrust many dead mens skulls between the stones,
yet could not find any such thing, or learn any news of it. 'Tis true, I found two mens heads
cut in the stone, at one certain place of the City-wall, but no body could tell me what they
Represented. It is also true, that, not far from the City, there are to be seen the ruins of a
Castle, which had some time been fortify'd, as the same Author sayes elsewhere. For it is certain,
that there are the remainders of a very strong place within half a League of the City, and
that towards the North-side, upon a very high, and very steepy Mountain, which is called Kale
Kulestan.
                  I had the curiosity to go up to the top of the said Mountain, and found nothing whole, but a
very noble great Cellar, and near it one of the deepest Wells that ever I saw, both compass'd
with the best free-stone that ever was put in any work. We were told that that Province had
heretofore had its particular Kings, and that Schiruan Scach had built that Castle, upon the accompt
of one of his Chasses, or Concubines, who gave it the name, and that it was Alexander
the Great that destroy'd that noble Structure, which none ever after offer'd to repair. I am of
opinion, that the Castle derived its name from the neighbouring Valley, in as much as, having
running through it a Brook, which makes it one of the most delightful places in the World, and
that being in the Spring cover'd with an infinite number of Tulips, which nature her self is
pleas'd to produce there, sit is not to be much admir'd, that they called the place Kale Kulestan,
that is, the Fort, or Castle of Roses, since the Persians give the name of Kulestan, or Valley of
Roses to all those places, where they would have it express'd, that there is an extraordinary
pleasantness. So that there is no necessity of seeking the Etymology of that name in Fables, or
in things which might have hapned before the time of Alexander the Great, whereof the Persians
have had nothing transmitted to them.
                  Near Kulestan,Sepulchres of Saints. between the Fort and the City of Scamachie, there are also two Chapels,
upon a Mountain, which is higher than that we spoke of last. In the greater of the two, which is
built in the form of a Parallelogram, there is a very high Sepulchre to be seen, and all about it
several pieces of Cloath and Rags of all sorts of colours, with Rods of Iron, whose ends are like
the tops of Arrows, and they are fastned or ty'd to the Sepulchre with a silk string. In the

other, there were two Sepulchres, adorn'd much after the same manner with the former.
These are the Tombs of some of their Saints, near which they often do their
Devotions.
                  From this last Chapel there is a descent into a spacious Vault,The Tomb of a Princess of Persia. where is to be seen the Sepulchre
of one of their Kings Daughters, named Amelek Kanna, of whom they relate, that she had
so great an aversion against marriage, that her Father desirous she should match with a Tartar-Prince,
she kill'd her self, to prevent it. The same Cartwright says, that the young maids of
those parts go once a year to the Sepulchre of this Princess, to bewail her death. It is possible,
that, in his time, some such thing might be done; but let it be taken for certain, that that
custom is now absolutely abolish'd, and that it is not Devotion, but the Heat, which obliges
the Inhabitants, in the height of Summer, to retire to this Mountain, as also to Kulestan, for
the greater coolness of the air: and that it is out of such a consideration, that they do their Devotions
near these Saints more frequently in that season, than at any other time of the year.
Trades-men, and persons of mean condition, stay there only in the day time, and at night return
to the City; but the Chan, the Calenter, and persons of quality have their Tents pitch'd
there, and remove not thence during the three hottest Moneths of the year. During which time
they also drive their Cattel towards the Mountain of Elbours, where they find not only a more
temperate air, but also as good Meadow-ground as any in all Persia. That Mountain is part
of Mount Caucasus, and it is of such height, that though it be at a very great distance from
thence, inasmuch as it lies on one side of Tabristhan, towards Georgia, yet may it be discover'd
from Kale Kulesthan, and the other neighbouring Mountains of Scamachie. It was upon
this Mountain of Elbours,The perpetual fe of the antient Persians. as it is reported, that the Persians kept and antiently Worshiped
their perpetual Fire: but now there is not the least track to be seen of it, neither there, nor near
Iescht, though Texeira, and those who follow him, would have us believe the contrary. True
indeed it is, that there are, to this day, in the Indies, certain Religious men, who have a
Veneration for the Fire, and keep it in with the same care that the Persians did heretofore; as
we shall take occasion to shew in the subsequent Travels of Mandelslo into those parts. But it
is time we return to the pursuance of our Journey.
                  The Baggage being sent away the 27. of March in the Evening,The Ambassadors presecute their journey. the Ambassadors follow'd
the next day, and were upon their way two hours before day. The Ambassador Brugman, who
was dis-satisfy'd with the Treatment we had receiv'd at Scamachie, would not permit the Calenter
should have the honour to conduct us, but gave order we should dislodge and depart without
any noise, and that all should go, while it was yet Night, afoot out of the Gates, where
we took Horse. Having Travell'd about two Leagues, we found a Scotch-man of our retinue,
whose name was Alexander Chambers, dead in the Waggon, though, at the Loading of the
Baggage, he seem'd to be so well, as that it was conceiv'd he might have gone through the
Journey, which occasion'd us to make a Halt, to dispose of the Body into the ground. We
buried him at the bottom of a little Hill, cover'd all over with Hyacinths, on the left hand, near
the High-way.
                  Having got half a League further, we came to the Sepulchre of another Saint, named Pyr
Mardechan, in the Country of Fakerlu, where we were forc'd to take up our Quarters in the
open Air, and without Tents, making a shift in that manner to pass over one of the sharpest
Nights we had in all our Journey, by reason of the Storm, which came attended by Lightning,
Thunder, Wind, Rain, Snow and Frost; the Ambassador Brugman being desirous to outvy the
Thonder, with our Artillery, which he caus'd to be several times discharg'd. The next day,
the same Ambassador having observ'd, that several pieces of Canon were left behind, because
there were not Camels enough to bring them away,The demeanour of one of the Ambassadors. and that the Horses were too weak to draw
them, would needs fall out with the Mehemander, and was so transported with Passion, that
he came to Railing, and Spetting when he nam'd the Chan and the Calenter, and said that the
Chan had not been so good as his Word, and had ly'd in all he said, but that he should resent it,
and that he would either have his Life, or the other should have his.
                  Some were of opinion, that he would stay there till the pieces we had left at Scamachie were
brought up: but, upon the Remonstrances of some others, that the place was too incommodious;
that we had nothing over our Heads; that we should want both Wood and Provisions,
and that the sick Persons would not be able to endure the Cold, it was resolv'd we should go
on, which we did, and came, after two Leagues travel to a Caravansera, called Tachsi, and
having gone two Leagues further, we were got to the top of the Mountain of Schamachie.
                  Upon the top of the said Mountain there is a fair Plain, and an even and fertile ground,
though in Winter, and at the beginning of the Spring, Rain, Snow and hard Weather are
no strangers there, and bring the same inconveniences along with them, as they do in some parts
of Europe. But as soon as we were come to the brow or descent of the Mountain, we saw a
clear Sky, a chearful Sun, and discover'd a Country wholly cover'd with Verdure, in a spacious
Plain, which reaching above ten Leagues, without any excrescency so much as to the

height of two foot, represented to us, as it were in a Map, the Course and Conjunction of
those two Rivers, Araxes and Cyrus, which the Writings of Antient Historians and Geographers
have so highly celebrated. This descent was above half a league, but easie, and not very
steepy; so that those who went fore-most, looking behind them, saw the last of our company
descending as it were out of the Clouds. We took up our Lodging that night in certain Ottacks,
or Huts, which the Tartarian Shepherds had set up there near their Flocks.
                  Mar. 30. we got four leagues, along the Plain, as far as the Village of Kasilu. We met, in
our way,Nomades. with a company of Sheep-herds and Cow-herds, who march'd with their Houses and
all their Houshold-stuff, their Wives and Children, all as it were shuffled together in Wagons,
or pack'd up upon Horses, Cows, Asses, and other Creatures, not ordinarily us'd in carriage,
after a very odd manner, and such as represented a very Fantastick kind of Transmigration.
                  Ever after that day, we had nothing but fair weather, a Sky clear, and without any cloudiness,
save that when we travell'd over the Mountains, we might, in the Morning, see the Heavens a
little over-cast; but as soon as the Sun appear'd, all was dispell'd.
                  March the last, we travell'd two leagues, along the River side, to a Village named Tzauat,
upon the right side of the Kur, or the River, which the Antients called Cyrus, all the Houses
whereof were built of Reeds and Canes,The conjunction of Cyrus and Aras. and cover'd with Earth. About a quarter of a league
above this Village, is the Conflux, or meeting of this River with that of Araxes, which is
now called Aras, at thirty nine degrees, fifty four minutes Elevation; the Cyrus coming from
West-north-west, and the Aras from South-west. These Rivers after they are met together are
about four hundred paces in breadth. Their water is black and deep, and the brink on both sides
pretty high. All along the River side, and all the Meadow grounds of the Province of Mokan,
were cover'd with Liquorice, the stalk whereof is many times as big as a man's arm, and the
juyce, beyond all comparison, sweeter and more pleasant than that of Europe.
                  The River Kur serves for a common Frontier to the two Provinces of Schiruan and Mokan,The Frontiers of Schiruan and Mokan
and there is a Bridge of Boats over it, near Tzawat. We pass'd over it the second of April,APRIL. and
found, on the other side of the River, another Mehemandar, whom the Chan or Governour of
Ardebil had sent to meet us, and to conduct us in the pursuance of our Journey, as far as the
chief City of his Government. He had brought along with him, for the carriage of us and the
Baggage, forty Camels, and three hundred Horses: in regard, the way we were then to come
into being very bad, by reason of the continued Mountains and Valleys, we could not have made
any use of our Waggons. He supply'd us with Provisions in abundance, allowing us, every
day, ten Sheep, thirty Batmans of Wine, and Rice, Butter Eggs, Almonds, Raisins, Apples,
and all sorts of Fruits as much as we pleas'd. On Sunday, after Sermon, we departed,
taking our way along the River Aras, for above a League. We lodg'd that night within half a
League of the River, at the entrance of a great Heath in Hutts, which the Mehemandar had
purposely ordered to be provided, for our convenience.
                  April the third, we pass'd over the Heath, which reaches about four Farsangs, or Persian
Leagues,Ahu, a kind of Deer. and we were lodg'd again that night in Hutts, as we had been the night before. We
had seen all that day in great Herds, a kind of Deer, which the Turks call Tzeiran, and the Persians,
Ahu, which have some resemblance to our Harts, save that they are rather Red than
Fawn, and their Horns have no Brow-anclers, but are smooth, and lye backward like those of
wild Goats. They are very swift, and there are not any of that kind, as we were told,
but what are in the Province of Mokan, and about Schamachie, Karrabach, and Merrage.
                  April 4. we were forc'd to leave the way of the Heath, though much the nearer, and to take
another, which brought us, by a great compass of above six Leagues, to a Torrent called Balharu,
out of this consideration, that if we had travell'd along the Heath, we should have wanted
water,Tortoises. both for our selves and our Horses. We found in that place abundance of Tortoises,
which had made their Nests along the side of the Torrent, and in the Sand of the little Hills
thereabouts, but all expos'd to the Mid-day Sun, so to give the greater heat to their Eggs, which
cannot be hatch'd but in the Hot,The Inhabitants. or rather burning Sand. Perceiving some men on the other
side of the Torrent, some of our people had the curiosity to cross it, to observe their manner of
Life: Their Children were stark Naked, and Aged persons had nothing about them but a shirt
or smock of Cotton. The poor people entertain'd us very kindly, and brought us some Milk.
They thought that the King of Persia had sent for us, to serve him in his Wars against the Turk,
out of which perswasion, they pray'd for our good success, that God would make their and our
Enemy fly before us, as far as Stampl, that is, Constantiople.
                  April the 5. we overcame the Heath of Mokan, and came to the Mountain and Country of
Betzirwan,Betzirwan after we had twelve several times cross'd one little River, which lay so many times
in our way. We got that day five leagues, and lodg'd at night in a Village called Schechmr at.
Most of the Houses were built at the foot of the Mountain, and some within the Mountain, and
were cover'd with Reeds: but we found not any Body in the Village, for those who went along

with the Chan of Schamachie's Present, for Ispahan, had made the Country people believe, us
they pass'd that way, that we were a sort of Barbarous people, who thought it not enough to
take and ransack all, but did also abuse and beat such as entertain'd us: upon which accompt of
us, they were all gone to hide themselves in the Rocks of the neighbouring Mountain. There
were some of our company, who got up a very high Mountain to see what Simples they could
find there, and to take a view of the adjacent Country: but they found not any there, and the
other nearer Mountains, which were higher than that we were upon, absolutely deprived us of
the sight of the Champain.
                  They met not with any thing remarkable there, save that upon the very top of the Mountain,
there was a pleasant Spring, near which we saw coming out of the clefts of the Rock a
kind of Crabb, which some among us, who had never seen any before, took for some venemous
Creature. The Author is of opinion, that it is a Sea-fish; but he is mistaken, for it is properly
no other animal than that which in Latin is called Cancer, is found in Rivers, and is of a
different species from the common Sea-crabb, which is called Acastus. We sate down by the
Spring-side, and, in what Liquor nature had furnish'd the place with, drunk to our Friends in
Germany.
                  April 6. We could not possibly get above two Leagues, over Mountains and Rocks, where
we saw a great number of Fig-trees, which the Earth produc'd there without any Cultivation.
We came at night to a ruin'd Village, called Tisle; but ere we had quite taken up our Quarters
and unloaded the Baggage, word was brought us, that it was the Plague, which, the Autumn
before, had consumed  the Inhabitants of that place; whereupon we immediately left it. The
Ambassadors caus'd a Tent to be pitch'd in the fields, but all the rest of the retinue had, at first,
no other covering over their Heads than the Sky, till the Mehemandar had sent for some Tartarian
Huts,Tartarian Hutts. which were brought late in the night loaded upon Oxen. These kind of Huts are
made of several pieces of Wood, which are fasten'd together at the ends, so as they may be taken
a-sunder, or set together in a short time. The Sieur Vchterits, who had stay'd a while in
the Village, to see the Baggage loaden and convey'd thence, coming to the Ambassadors??? Tent,
was so rail'd at by the Ambassador Brugman, who reproach'd him that he came from an Infected
House, to bring the Plague among them, that he fell into a Feaver.
                  There were some in the Company, who finding the weather somewhat close and cold, went
and lock'd themselves up in a house, where they made a good fire, and spent the time merrily
with the Wine they had kept the day before, diverting themselves, and singing to drive away
Melancholy, and to forget the froward humour of the Ambassador Brugman, which they were
as much afraid of as the unwholsome air. The Indians had begun the building of a Caravansera
in that place, for the convenience of Commerce, which was grown to a considerable height;
but the Plague had hindred them from finishing it.
                  The 7.Ill weather, we had a very sad dayes journey of it, being forc'd, in a continual trot, to travel above
ten leagues, without ever baiting, in the cold, the wind, and the snow, which not onely disheartned
our people, many whereof fell sick, but lay so heavy upon the Camels, that divers of
them fell down under their burthens. There is in these parts abundance of Absynthium, or
Wormwood,A ven
                        ous Herb??? and we were told, that the Herb of it is so venemous, that if Horses or any
other Creature eat thereof, they die immediately, upon which accompt it was, that we durst
not unbit that day. About noon, we came in sight of a Caravansera, called Aggis, the structure
whereof is of the noblest kind we had seen.The King sends another Conductor to meet the Ambassadors. Not far from it, we met a Persian, who was excellently
well mounted, and attended by two servants, who told us, that the King had sent him
to be our Mehemandar, to take order for our subsistence, and to Conduct us with the soonest
to the Court. We lodg'd that night in a Village called Tzanlu, at the foot of a Mountain,
where we found excellent Gardens, and abundance of fruit-trees, but no Wood for firing, insomuch
that we were forc'd to make use of Cow-dung, Hors-dung, and Camels-dung. We
sent away that day our Forrager, to take up Quarters for us at Ardebil.
                  The 8. having broke our fast, we got on Hors-back, and after we had travell'd three leagues
along the Mountain of Tzizetlu, we came to the River Karasu, which rises out of the Mountain
of Bakru, in the Countrey of Kilan. VVe cross'd it near the Village of Samajan, over a
very fair stone bridge, containing six noble Arches, which were in all thirty eight fathom in
length. About half a league thence, we came to the end of that day's journey, to a Village called
Thabedar, two little leagues from Ardebil, where we stay'd that night. The next day, being
Easter-day,
we saw how the Inhabitants dawb the VValls of their Houses with Dung, that
the Sun may the sooner dry it, and make it combustible: but we were also in this place terribly
persecuted with Fleas and Lice, and other nasty Vermine, wherewith we were in a manner
cover'd.
                  The 9. we Celebrated our Easter, beginning the Festival with the firing of our great Guns,
and small shot, which we ordered to be discharged thrice. That done, we had a Sermon, and
did our Devotions.
                  About noon we were visited by our new Mehemandar, whose name was Netzefbce; he

was a person of an excellent good humour. He came to Complement us upon occasion of the
Festival, and brought us a Present of five fishes dry'd in the Sun, a dish, full of Bread, Pomegranates,
Apples, and a sort of Pears I had never seen before, fashion'd like a Citron, and full of
a very pleasant juyce, and having a sweet scent, pickled Cowcumbers, preserv'd Garlick, and
Schiras-wine, which is the most esteem'd of any that grows in Persia.
                  April 10. being Easter-Monday: we made our entrance into Ardebil, for the most part
with the same Ceremonies, but with greater Pomp and Magnificence, than we had done at Scamachie.
About noon, we met with a party of Horse, which having saluted, and taken a view of
us, immediately returned towards the City.
                  Near the Village of Kelheran,The entrance of the Ambassadors into Ardebil. (which is so noble a place, that viewing, at a distance, its Steeples,
or Towers, whereof there are a very great number, and they make a very great shew, in
regard they are built of stones of several colours, we took it for the City it self, though they
are distant one from the other above half a league) we met with, in the head of a body of Horse,
the Calenter of Ardebil, whose name was Taleb Chan, an aged, and very spare man. Having saluted
the Ambassadors, he rid on one side of them. Having pass'd by the Village, we saw in a
spacious Plain, abundance of horse and foot, who opened to make us way. Some paces thence,
we saw crossing the fields towards us at the head of a Brigade of above a thousand Horse, the Governour
of Ardebil, whose name was Kelbele Chan. He was a low man, but of a good aspect
and pleasant humour. After the Complements reciprocally past between him and the Ambassadors,
he rode in between them. Before our Troop, there march'd two youths clad in Sheepskins
of several colours, upon their clean skirts, and carrying each of them upon the top of a
long and very slender pole, an Orenge. The poles, we were told, were made of a
Date-tree.
                  These youths read and sung, out of a Book, certain Verses made in honour of Mahomet,
Aly, and Schach Sefi. They were Sons or Disciples to a certain Abdalla, of whom we shall
speak hereafter. After them came others, who were cloathed in white, and had a wonderful
Art in imitating the Notes and singing of Nightingales and other birds. On both sides march'd
the Timbrels and Hawboies; in some places there were people dancing and singing at the same
time, and at others were some dancing after another manner. Some cast their caps up into the
air, and caught them again with cries and exclamations of joy. There were some danc'd with
little Garlands about their heads, much like those we had seen at Scamachie, when they celebrated
there, the death of Aly. Near the City stood the Guards, in two files, having their
Bows and Arrows in their hands, Coats of Mail about their bodies, and their heads cover'd
with little Caps like Calottes, which they call Aratskin, in which they had plac'd abundance
of Feathers, the ends whereof, some thrust through their Caps, into the skin. Many of them
were naked down to the waste, and though they had the flesh of their Arms and Breasts pierced
with Daggers or Ponyards, yet did they not seem sensible of any pain thereat; whence we
inferr'd there might be something of Charm in it, and that they were Sorcerers, there being
abundance that deserve that name in Persia. There was also a Company of Indians, who as we
pass'd by, saluted us, after their way, with a low inclination of the head, putting their hands
to their breasts. When we were come somewhat near the City, there was so great a confluence
of people, that we could not get a hundred paces forward without making a halt; insomuch
that they were forc'd to drive them away with Cudgels and Bulls-pizzels, so to make
them give way. And within the City, all the Windows, Houses-tops, Steeples, and Trees, were
full of those, who came from all parts to see our passage through it.
                  The Governour brought us, through a spacious Garden, into a fair Summer-house, to which
there were ten stairs to get up,The Governour gives them a Collation. and treated us with a sumptuous Collation, in a very stately
Gallery; honouring all those who came up with the Ambassadors so far as to present, to every
one of them with his own hands, a Vessel full of Wine, while all the rest of the Retinue were
treated below, in a Tent, which had been purposely pitch'd there to that end. The Collation
was accompany'd with the best Musick the Country could afford, as also with a Dance performed
by their Ochtzi, or Archers, who dancing, in cadence, with their Bows in their hands,
represented a kind of Ball, which their exactness of the observance of time made more delightful
& divertive, than had been the singing of those two youths, the sons of Abdalla, who with
their Orenges in their hands, very seriously celebrated the praises of their Prophet. After the
Collation and Divertisement, the Ambassadors were conducted to very spacious Lodgings,
which had been taken up for them in one of the noblest parts of the City, which Lodgings had
sometime belong'd to Sara Chutza, high Chancellor of Persia. The rest of the Retinue were
Lodg'd not far from them, in the neighbourhood, where they were well accommodated, by those
into whose houses they were receiv'd.
                  This Summer-house, being one of the noblest Structures I ever saw, deserves I should give in
this place a more particular description of it.The Chan's House described. Sulfagar Chan, the Predecessor of Kelbele Chan,
in the Government of Ardebil, a Person of infinite wealth, had built it, according to a modell
he had brought out of Turkey. The figure of it was Octagonal, and it was three Stories, so

rais'd, that Art had not left any thing to be desir'd. Every story had its Fountains, which
cast their water higher than any part of the House. The Walls were built of a sort of Glittering
stones, of all Colours, Blew, Green, Red, and of all sorts of Figures, and all the Floors
were cover'd with the richest Tapistry the Country could afford. All about the House there
was a spacious Gallery, all built with Marble, and adorn'd with Painting, representing Flowers
and Leaves. At one of the corners of that Gallery, there was a little Couch or Chair of
State, four foot square, cover'd with Embroider'd Tapistry, having in the midst a Quilt
wrought with Gold and Silk,The veneration the Persians have for their Prince??? to signifie, that the King, passing one day through Ardebil, had
rested himself there; which made the place so Venerable, that, to the end none should come
near it, it was encompass'd with an Iron rail. The said Sulfagar Chan had built also another
House of Pleasure or Summer-house, in a great Garden, near a stone-Bridge, without the City;
but at the time of our Travels that way, it lay desolate, as indeed it had been ever since
the Death of Sulfagar, who had been Executed, upon the instigation of Kartzogar, General
of the Persian Army. The other House, which was within the City, had been bestow'd by the
King upon Kelbele Chan, to be enjoy'd by him during his Life.
                  The next day after our arrival,Thaberick??? which was April 11. there was brought the Ambassadors
from Schich-Sefi's Kitchin, the Thaberick; which is a certain quantity of Meat, sent in for three
meals, to such great Lords, and other Persons of quality, as come into that City, according
to a pious Institution, which hath been observ'd about the Body of Schich-Sefi, Author and
Founder of the Religion of the Persians, as also near that of the late King, whose Sepulchres
are at Ardebil. Our Thaberick was brought us in 32 great Dishes or Basins full of Rice, of all
sorts of Colours, upon which the Meat was laid, which consisted of Boyl'd, Roast, Omelets,
and Pastry, according to their way of Dressing. Those who were appointed to bring us this
Dinner, carry'd the Dishes upon their Heads, and set them down upon a Cloath, which was
laid upon the ground.
                  We were not over-pleas'd with this Entertainment, by reason, not only of the trouble it was
to us to sit down according to the Persian way,Is serv'd without Wine. but also because we were forbidden to drink any
Wine at this Feast of the Thaberick. However, we ordered our great Guns to be discharg'd
at it, as also our Trumpets to sound, and would have made a small Present to those who had
brought it; but they desir'd to be excus'd, telling us, that the Devotion of the place permitted
them not to receive any Presents.
                  The next day, there was such order taken for the Provisions of the Kitchin, that we had all
the reason in the world to be satisfy'd therewith. We were allow'd every day sixteen Sheep,
two hundred Eggs, four Batmans (which come to 26 pounds) of Butter, thirteen pound of
Raisins of the Sun, six pound and a half of Almonds, a hundred Batmans of Wine, two Batmans
of Sirrup, Meal, Honey; and Poultry in abundance, besides the extraordinary Presents,
which were ever and anon brought us from the Chan;The expence at Ardebil. insomuch, that our expence, during our
stay at Ardebil, amounted to,

                        In Bread, 1960. Batmans.
                        In Wine, 6250. Batmans.
                        Eggs, 9300.
                        Sheep, 477.
                        Lambs, 472.
                     
                  
                  April. the 12.The Governours visit we receiv'd the first visit from the Governour, who, with much kindness, came
to make the proffers of his services to the Ambassadors, whereof we afterwards found the real
effects, when occasion required. The same day, he sent away an Express to Court, to give
notice there of our arrival, and to receive orders for the prosecution of our Journey, which yet
came not till two moneths after.
                  April. 21.The visit of an Armenian Bishop. Christian Churches in Asia. an Armenian Bishop came to see the Ambassadors. He was but lately come thither
from the City of Eruan, was a Person discours'd very handsomely, and told us many particulars
concerning the state of the Christian Churches in Asia. Among other things, he told
us, that there was near Eruan a Monastery wherein there were above four hundred Religious
men, and that there were in the Mountains, between Aras and Kur, above a thousand Villages
inhabited by Christians, and that there were, besides all these, near Cawin and Tauris above two
thousand Families, which made up in all above five hundred Churches. Whereto he added,
that the Turks had, not long before, carried away above fifteen hundred Christians, and very
highly commended the King of Persia, for his care in preserving their Privileges, and not burthening
them with Taxes, as the Turk does, intreating us to recommend their concernments to
the King, when we should come to Court.
                  April. 25.Kurban or Sacrifice of the Persians. which, according to the Arabians, is the 10. day of the moneth Silhotza, was
the great Bairam, or the Festival which they call Kurban, that is, Sacrifice, in commemoration
of the Sacrifice, which Abraham would have made of his son Ismael, according to the command

of God: for so they understand the History of the Sacrifice of Abraham. All their Ceremony
consists in killing, before day, a Sheep, or Lamb, in the street, at their own Doors, which
being cut into pieces, they distribute them among the poor, who come to those Doals
in great numbers. They do not reserve so much as the skin; which they do, as they affirm, according
to the example of Abraham, who reserv'd nothing of the Ram, which he sacrifiz'd instead
of his Son.
                  It is about this time,The Pilgrimages of the Persians and Turks. that the Persians go to do their Devotions at Meca, as well as the
Turks. They say that Noah, when he went into the Ark, took along with him seventy two
Persons, and for that reason, it is requisite the Pilgrims of Meca should amount to the number
of seventy two thousand; and that number ought to be so exactly observ'd, that if there be either
more or less, they must not be receiv'd there, as such, that year. But above all things, it
is their main care, that that great number be compleat; for otherwise, as they affirm, the Angels
would be oblig'd to come in, to make up what were wanting, and it were a wont of respect
to those Spirits to put them to that trouble. The men put on a particular Coiffure for
this Voyage, which is a kind of Turbant of white Wool; in regard their Law forbids them to
wear it of any Colour, or of silk at that time. They call this kind of Turbant Ehharan, and
they cover their Heads therewith, only as they go; so as that one part of it falling down on one
side of the Head, passes under the Chin, and is fasten'd on the other side.
                  They commonly take their way through the City of Ierusalem,Particulars of the Pilgrimage to Meca. where they do their first
Devotions. Thence they pass through Medina, where they continue them, at the Sepulchre
of Mahomet, which they kiss with a profound Veneration, and then they conclude them at Meca,
or Mount Arafat. From Medina to Meca, they are cover'd only with a shirt, nay
some go naked down to the waste. In this posture, they march continually, and after a very
particular fashion. For they are oblig'd to go, after the rate of a trotting Horse, or rather that
of a Camel galloping; and that with such earnestness, that they hardly take the leisure to eat
and drink, or yet to sleep: and all, out of an imagination, that the Sweat caus'd by that Violent
Motion, and forc'd out of their Bodies, carries away with it all their Sins, and cleanseth
them of all their filthiness. The Women, who might not be able to bear the inconveniences of
such a march, have the privilege to swath up their Breasts with a Skarf, which hath a particular
name, and they call it Scamachtze.
                  The tenth day of the moneth of Silhatza, is that of their great Devotion. That day, all the
Pilgrims go to Mount Arafat, which, they say, is the place where the Patriarch Abraham
should have Sacrifiz'd his Son, and there they spend the whole night in Prayers. Towards the
dawning of the day, they come down, and go to the City of Meca, where their Hetzas, or
High-Priest, makes a Procession, conducting through the chief streets a Camel, which is appointed
for the Sacrifice. The Hair of this Camel is a very precious Relick among them;
whence it comes, that the Pilgrims throng, to get as near as they can to the Beast, and to
snatch off some of his Hair, which they fasten to their arms, as a very sacred thing. The Hetzas,
after he hath walk'd the Beast sufficiently leads him to the Meydan, that is, the great Marketplace,
and puts him into the hands of the Baily, or Judge of the City, whom they call Daroga,
who, attended by some other Officers, kills him with an Axe, giving him many blows in the
Head, Neck, and Breast.
                  As soon as the Camel is dead, all the Pilgrims endeavour to get a piece of him, and throng
with such earnestness and so confusedly, with Knives in their hands, that these Devotions are
never concluded, but there are many Pilgrims kill'd and hurt, who are afterwards allow'd a
place in their Martyrologies. After all these Ceremonies, they go in Procession about the
Mosquey, they kiss a Stone, which was left after the finishing of the Structure, and they take
of the Water, which passes through a Golden Chanel over the Mosquey, and carry it away as a
Relick, with a little piece of a certain Blackish Wood, of which ooth-picks are commonly
made. When the Pilgrims are return'd from their Pilgrimage they are called Hatzi, and they
are as it were Nazarites, dedicated to God, in as much as it is unlawful for them to drink Wine
ever after.
                  From this Pilgrimage, and the Sacrifice perform'd at Meca, we shall take occasion to insert
here, what the Persians and Turks relate of that of Abraham, as Mahomet hath dress'd up the
story, falsifying the truth of it in all its circumstances. They say in the first place, that Abraham
was the son of Azar, who was Graver to Nimroth, King of Egypt, and that he married
Sara, who was so beautifull a Woman, that the King having cast his eye on her, Abraham
grew jealous, and carried her away into Arabia; but finding that she bore no Children, he
there bought a Slave, named Hagar, whom he carnally knew, and, by her, had Ismael. Hagar
being near her time, and not able any longer to endure the ill treatment she receiv'd from Sara,
resolv'd to run away. Abraham coming to hear of her discontent, and fearing she might make
away the Child, especially if she came to be deliver'd without the assistance of some other Women,
follow'd her, and found her already deliver'd of a Son, who, dancing with his little feet
upon the ground, had ade way for a Spring to break forth. But the water of the Spring came

forth in such abundance, as also with such violence, that Hagar could make no use of it to
quench her thirst, which was then very great. Abraham coming to the place, commanded the
Spring to glide more gently, and to suffer that water might be drawn out of it to drink, and having
thereupon stay'd the course of it with a little Bank of Sand, he took of it, to make Hagar
and her child drink. The said Spring is, to this day, called Semsem, from Abraham's making
use of that word to stay it. After this Sara pray'd to God with such earnestness, that he gave
her her son Isaac.
                  Some time after Ismael's birth, the Angel Gabriel appear'd to Abraham, and told him, that
God commanded him to build a house upon the River, which Ismael had given the rise to: in
answer whereto, Abraham representing, that it was impossible for him to build any great
structure in the midst of a Desart, where there was nothing but Sand; the Angel reply'd, that
he should not be troubled at that, and that God would provide. Accordingly, Abraham was
no sooner come to the place appointed him by the Angel, but Mount Arafat forc'd out of its
quarries a great number of stones, which roll'd down from the top of the Mountain, to the side
of the little River, where he built a house, which hath since been converted to a Mosquey, and
is the same where the Pilgrims of Meca do their Devotions. The Structure being finish'd, there
happened to be one single stone remaining, which began to speak, and to complain that it had
been so unfortunate, as not to be employ'd in that Edifice. But Abraham told it, that it should
so much the rather be comforted, in as much as it should one day be in greater Veneration than
all the rest put together, and that all the faithfull who came to that place should kiss it. This is
the stone we spoke of before. These people say, it was heretofore all white, and that the reason
of its being now black, is, that it hath been constantly kiss'd through so many ages.
                  Some years after, the same Angel Gabriel appeared again to Abraham, who was grown a
very rich and powerful man, and told him, that God intended to make the highest tryal that
could be of his affection and gratitude, and that he would have him, in acknowledgement of so
many favours, to sacrifize his son to him. Abraham immediately consented, and being return'd
home, bid Hagar call up her son, and put on his best Cloaths, that he might be the better look'd
on at the Wedding, to which he intended to carry him. They departed the next day betimes
in the morning, and took their way towards Mount Arafat, Abraham carrying along with
him a good sharp knife, and some Cords. But as soon as they were gone, Sceithan, that is to
say, the Devil, represented himself to Hagar, in the shape of a man, reporach'd her with the
easiness, wherewith she had consented, that her son Ismael should go from her, and told her,
that what Abraham had related to her concerning the Wedding, to which he was to bring him,
was pure forgery, and that he was carrying him streight to the Shambles. Hagar ask'd him
why Abraham would use her so, since he had alwayes express'd a great tenderness to her son.
The Devil made answer, that God had commanded it should be so; whereto Hagar reply'd,
that since it was God's good pleasure to make that disposal of him, it was but fit she should
comply therewith. Whereupon the Devil pressing harder upon her, and treating her as an unnatural
Mother, endeavouring by those aggravations to bring her into rebellion against God, she
pelted him away with stones. The Devil's endeavour proving unsuccessfull that way, and too
weak to overcome the obstinacy of a woman, he apply'd himself to Abraham, reviv'd in him
the tendernesses and affection of a Father, represented to him the horrour of the murther he was
going to commit, and remonstrated to him the little likelyhood there was, that God should be
the Author of so barbarous and abominable an action. But Abraham, who was acquainted with
the subtilty and artifices of that wicked spirit, sent him away, and to be the sooner rid of him,
cast also a stone at him. The last attempt the Devil had to make, was, to represent to Ismael
the horrour of death, and the unnatural procedure of his Father: but he found the same treatment
from him, as he had from the other two, and had a good stone flung at his head. The
Father and Son being come to the top of the Mountain, Abraham said to his Son Ismael; My
Son, I cannot imagine thou knowest the occasion of our journey, and the reason why I have
brought thee to this place. It is only this, that God hath commanded me to sacrifize thee:
whereto Ismael made answer, that since it was God's pleasure it should be so, his will be done,
only let me entreat thee, Father, to grant me three things. The first is, that thou have a care to
bind me so fast, that the pains of death may not engage me to attempt any thing against thee.
The second is, that thou whet thy knife very well, and, after thou hast thrust it into my throat,
that thou hold it very fast, and shut thy eyes, out of a fear the cruelty of the action dishearten
thee from going through with it, and so leave me to languish a long time. And the third, that,
when thou art returned home, thou remember my duty to my Mother.
                  Abraham, having promis'd to observe all these things, and whetted his knife, binds his son,
directs the knife to his Throat, and, shutting his eyes, holds it as fast as he could: but finding,
when he opened his eyes again, that the knife had made no entrance, he is extremely troubled,
and tries the edge of it upon a stone, which he cuts in two. He was so astonish'd thereat, that
he address'd himself to the Knife, and asked it, why, having so good an edge as to cut a stone,
it could not as well cut his Sons Throat. The knife made answer, that God would not have it

so. Whereupon the Angel Gabriel took Abraham by the hand, and said to him; Hold a little,
God would only make tryal of thy faith, Unbind thy Son, and sacrifize this Hee-Goat; and
immediately there came into the place a Hee-Goat, which Abraham offered to God, for a
burnt-offering.
                  They affirm, that the three stones, which Hagar, Abraham and Ishmael cast at the Devil, are
yet to be seen, near the High-way, between Medina and Meca, and that there are made thereof
two great heaps of stones, by the means of the Pilgrims, who bring every one three stones,
to be cast at the Devil, at the same place where these heaps are, to the end he may not distract
them in their Devotions.
                  We saw also the same day above five hundred Women,Prayers for the dead. who were going before day to the
Church-yard to weep over the Graves of their Husbands, and others of their kinred. There
were some who had somewhat to eat at the same time; others had some passages of the
Alchoran read to them; and those of any quality had Tents pitch'd there, for their reception,
that they might not be expos'd to the sight of all that pass'd by.
                  This kind of Devotion for the Dead is commonly performed in the time of their Orut, or
Lent.
                  The Ambassadors were again that day treated out of Schich-Sefi's Kitchin. The meat was
brought in, in six great Copper Vessels tinn'd over, which they call Lenkeri, and the Conserves,
in nine great Vessels of Porcelain.
                  The next day,The Chan treats the Ambassadors. the Chan treated them very Magnificently, at a Dinner he had provided in one
of his Summer-houses.
                  The 27. in the evening, the Governour communicated to the Ambassadors the good news he
had received from Chan Rustan,Acquaints them with the violent death of the Grand-Signior. General of the King of Persia's Army, who had writ to him,
that the Ianizaries, in a mutiny at Constantinople, had kill'd the Grand Signior, and imprin'd
the most eminent Ministers of his Courr. The Persians express'd their joy thereat, by the fireworks
which the Governour order'd to be made, as also by the Musick, which ecchoed all over
the City. The Ambassadors did the like on their part, with their great Guns, causing them
to be fired six times over, and ordering the Trumpets to sound, and the Drums to beat, while
from the roof of their Lodgings they could see all the fires about the City.
                  The Governour was so well pleas'd to see that the Ambassadors concern'd themselves so much
in the publick joy, that he sent them two flaggons of Schiras Wine, with a Glass-Vessel, full of
Sugar-candy'd.
                  May the first,MAY. we Celebrated the Birth-day of the Ambassador Crusius, which was concluded
at night with a Magnificent Supper, to which we had invited out Mehemander Netzefbek.
                  The 4. the Ambassadors receiv'd a visit from the son of Saru-Taggi,The Chancellor of Persia's son visits the Ambassadors. Chancellor of Persia,
who was come purposely from Ispahan, accompany'd by some persons of quality, to see the
Ambassadors. We entertain'd him with our Musick, which he seem'd to be much taken with,
and treated him with a sumptuous Collation, during which, the great Guns were discharg'd, as
often as there was any great health drunk.
                  May 14. the Persians began to Celebrate a mournful Festival,A particular Festival of the Persians. which they call Aschur,
which signifies ten, in regard it lasts ten days, and begins with the Moon of the moneth Maheram.
Of all the sorts and Sects of Mabumetans, the Persians only Celebrate this Feast, in
memory of Hossein, the youngest son of Haly, whom they accompt one of their greatest Saints.
The Legends relate of him, that he was kill'd in the War he was engag'd in, against the Calif
Iesied. He was at first (according to their story of him) troubled with an extraordinary thirst,
in regard they had depriv'd him of all water. Afterwards, he had seventy two wounds, which
he receiv'd by Arrows, and at last, Senan ben anessi run him through the body with a sword, and
Schemr Sultzausen kill'd him out-right. That this Feast lasts ten dayes, proceeds hence; that
Hossein having left Medina to go to Kufa, was, for ten days together, pursu'd by his Enemies,
who treated him as we related before. During all that time, the Persians go in mourning, express
much affliction, suffer not the Rasour to come near their heads, though, at other times
they make use of it every day, live very soberly, drink no Wine, and content themselves with
Water. The whole City of Ardebil was taken up in these Ceremonies and extravagant Devotions.
In the day time, the Children and young Lads assembled themselves in great companies
up and down the streets, carrying in their hands great Banners, at the extremities whereof
there were Snakes of Pastboard winding to and fro, much like Mercury's Caduceus. The Persians
call them Eschder. They went to the Doors of their Metzits, or Mosqueys, and cry'd one
after another ja Hossein, ja Hossein, that is, O Hossein. In the evening, especially the three last
days of the Festival, after Sun-set, men did also meet in several places, under Tents, with abundance
of Torches and Lanthorns,A strange kind of Devotion. having at the tops of their Poles Orenges, as the Children
of Abdalla, singing, and crying out as loud as they were able, their ja Hossein, and that
with such violence, that it chang'd the colour of their countenances. Having  thus about
an hour, they return'd to the City, and went in Procession with their Banners and Torches,

through the principal streets. The tenth day concluded the Devotions of the Festival. In the
morning there was an Oration made in honour of Hossein, with the same Ceremonies in a manner,
as we had seen at the Festival of Aly at Scamachie. These Ceremonies were performed
in the Court of the Mesar of Schich-Sefi, where, near the Chancery, they had planted a Banner,
which, as it is reported, was made by the daughter of Fatima, the daughter of Mahomet,
who caus'd the Iron-work of it to be made of a hors-shooe, which had belong'd to one of the
horses of Abas,A false miracle. Uncle to Mahomet by the Father side, which Schich Sedredin, the son of
Schich-Sefi, had brought from Medina to Ardebil. They say, that this Banner shakes of it
self, as often as they pronounce the name of Hossein, during the Sermon which is made in honour
of him, and that when the Priest makes a recital of the particulars of his death, how he
was wounded with seventy two Arrows,, and how he fell down from his horse, it may be seen
shaken by a secret agitation, but withall so violent, that, the staff breaking, it falls to the
ground. I must confess, I saw no such thing, but the Persians affirm it so positively, that they
think it should not be any way doubted.
                  May 24. about noon, the Governour sent the Ambassadors notice, that they concluded the
Festival that night, and that if they would be present at the Ceremonies which were to be performed,
they should be very welcome, and he would take it for a great honour done him: but
it must be with this condition, that, complying with the Law of the Mussulmans, they were
not to expect any Wine at the Collation he intended to treat them withall.
                  In the cloze of the evening,The last Ceremonie of the Festival. the Ambassadors went to the Governour's Palace, who met
them at the street door. And whereas the Ceremony was to be done in the Court, they were
intreated to take their places on the left hand, where they had prepared Seats, cover'd with
Tapistry, for them, and their Retinue, who would have been much troubled, to sit as the Persians
do. There were set before them, upon a Cloath, wherewith they had cover'd the ground,
several Vessels of Porcelain, with Suger'd and Perfum'd waters, and, near the Table, brass
Candlesticks, four foot high, with great Wax Candles in them, as also Lamps, fill'd with rags
dipt in Suet and Naphte. The Governour took up his place at the entrance of the Court, on the
right side of the Gate, and fate upon the ground. Our people had standing before them great
Wooden Candlesticks, or Branches, holding each of them twenty or thirty Wax-Candles.
There were fasten'd to the Walls thousands of Lamps, of Plaister, all fill'd with Suet and Naphte,
which cast so great a light, that the house seem'd to be all on fire. They had drawn cross the
Court certain Cords whereat hung Paper-Lanthorns, which gave not so full, but, without
comparison, a more pleasant light, than that of the Lamps and Cresset-lights. The Inhabitants
of Ardebil are distinguish'd into five quarters, or professions, who meet each by it self, and intreat
some of their Poets,Persian Poets. whereof there are a very great number in Persia, to write them some
Verses, in commendation of Aly and Hossein, and making choice of those among them who
sing best, they go and give the Governour a Serenade, who receives kindly, and bestows
a Present of water sweetned with Sugar, on that band, which is most excellent, either as touts
invention or Musick.
                  These Musicians being come into the Court drew up in five bands, in so many several places,
and presented themselves one after another before the Governour; but, for the space of two
hours, they may be rather said to cry out and roar, than to sing: after which they all came by
order from the Governour, to make a Complement to the Ambassadors, and wish'd them a happy
journey, and good success in their Negotiation at the Court.
                  In the mean time, there were dancing at one place in the Court seven youths; all naked, excepting
only those parts which modesty would not have seen by all. They called that kind of
people Tzatzaku, and their bodies, from head to foot, were rubb'd over with Suet and
Naphte, insomuch that their black skins being more shining than jet, they might very well be
compar'd to so many little Devils. They had in their hands little stones, which they knock'd
one against the other, and sometimes they smote their breast with them, to express their sorrow
for the death of Hossein. These Tzatzaku are poor boys, who disguise themselves in that
manner, to get some small matter by it, which is, that they are permitted, during the time of
the Feast, to beg Alms for Hossain's sake. At night, they do not lodge at their Homes, but ly in
the ashes which are brought out of Schich-Sefi's Kitchin. Some, instead of Suet, rub themselves
with Vermilion, that they may make a more lively representation of the blood of Hossein: but,
at this time, there were not any such. After these Ceremonies, the Governout entertain'd the
Ambassadors with noble fire-works; which most of the Persians took very ill at his hands, and
thought it not over religiously done of him, to give such Divertisements to the Christians during
the time of their Aschur, which ought to represent only things conducing to sadness and affliction.
                  These fire-works consisted of several very excellent and ingenious inventions,Fire-work. as of little Castles,
Towers, Squibs, Crackers, &c. The Castle, to which they first set fire, was three foot
square, the Walls of Paper, of all sorts of Colours. They lighted first several small Wax-Candles
about the moat of it, which discover'd the figures painted on the Paper. There came

out of it Squibs and Crackers for an hour and a half, or better, before the Castle it self took
fire. Then they set fire to another invention, which they call Derbende. It was a kind of Saucidge,
about six Inches thick, and three foot long, casting, at first, at both ends, a shower of
fire, and afterwards several Squibs and little Serpents, which falling among the people, set
their Cotton Garments on fire; while they fir'd several sorts of Crackers, which in the air,
were turn'd to Stars and other figures. They set fire also to several boxes; but what we most
admir'd was a great kind of fire-work, which was fasten'd to the ground with great Iron
Chains, and cast out fire at the mouth, with so dreadfull noise, that we were afraid it would
have burst at last, and scatter its fiery entrails among the company. This fire-work they call
Kumbara.
                  There were some, who carry'd Paper-Lanthorns upon long Poles, which were also fill'd
with squibs and crackers: but what diverted us most of all, was, that, out of those Lanthorns,
there came a piece of Linnen, which, being folded together, and ty'd up in knots, had, in each
of those knots, several squibs, crackers and serpents, which having much ado to get out, made an admirable
shew, by the windings which the fire made through all the folds of that piece of cloath.
Others carried in their aprons, a certain composition, into which some that pass'd by let fire
fall, as it were negligently, whereupon, he who carried it shaking his apron, there came out a
great number of Stars, which burnt a long time upon the ground.
                  In these Fire-works, the Persians make use of white Naphte, which is a kind of Petreolum:
but in regard this Drugg is seldome found in Europe, there may be used, to the same effect, the
spirit of Turpentine rectify'd. We saw also, at a great distance, in the air, certain flames,
which vanish'd as soon in a manner as they appear'd. I conceive these flames proceeded from a
certain Drugg, which the Muscovites call 'Plaun, which is a yellow powder made of a certain
herb, commonly found upon the ground, in the Forests that are planted with Pines and Birch,
and is properly called in Latin, Acanthus, in French, Branche ursine, in English, Bears-foot, or
Bears-britch. Every stalk of this herb hath on it two Buttons, which are ripe in August, and
then the Muscovites are very carefull to gather them, dry them in an Oven, beat them, and
keep the powder which comes from them in Ox-bladders, to be sold by the pound. It is us'd
also in Medicine, as being a drier, and is administred with good success in Wounds, and the
Itch. But the Muscovites use it for the most part in their Divertisements, putting it into a Tinbox
made like a Pyramid, into which they thrust that end of a Torch which is not lighted, and
by that means make the powder come out, which being very small, immediately fastens on the
flame, and is lighted, and disappears almost at the same time; so that continually thrusting in
the Torch, a man makes ever and anon a new flame, which is very lively, and makes the nobler
shew, in that it is not accompany'd with any smoke. This powder will not take fire, if it be
not stirr'd after the foresaid manner: for if it be cast upon burning coals, or if a lighted candle
be thrust into it, it would not take fire.
                  These Fire-works entertain'd us so long, that it was after mid-night ere we came to
our Quarters, where we found not any thing colder than the Hearth; for out of a presumption,
that the Governour would have treated us at Supper, there had been nothing provided at
home.
                  The next day,The enterment of Hossein reprrsented very betimes in the Morning, before the Sun was to be seen over the Horizon,
the Persians made a Procession, which was to represent the interment of Hossein. In this Procession
there were carried a great many Eschders and Banners, and there were led several excellent
Horses and Camels, cover'd with blew Cloath, in which were to be seen many Arrows
quilted, as if they had been purposely shot into it, representing those which the Enemies had
shot at Hossein. Upon these Horses rid so many Boyes, who had before them empty Cossins,
upon which they had cast a little Straw, or Hay, and they represented the great affliction of the
Children of Hossein. Upon some of those Horses, they had set fair Turbants, Cimitars, Bows,
and Quivers, full of Arrows.
                  As soon as the Sun was up,A bloody devotion. there might be seen in the base-Court, a very great number of
men, who let themselves Blood in the arms, in so great quantity, that a man would have
thought there had been many Oxen kill'd there. The young Lads slash'd and cut themselves
above the Elbow, and clapping the Wounds with their hands, they made the Blood spurt out
all over the Arm, and about the Body, and in that condition they ran up and down the City.
This was done in remembrance of the effusion of the innocent Blood of Hossein; out of a perswasion,
that, by this action, they expiated some part of their sins; which perswasion is the
stronger, in as much as they are prepossess'd with an opinion, that those, who dye during this
Festival, are infallibly saved. They speak also with the same assurance of their Salvation, who
dye during the Festival of Aly, and in their Lent.
                  As concerning the City of Ardebil,Ardebil described. which the Turks call Ardevil, and may be found in Maps
under the name of Ardonil, it lies in the Province of Adirbeitzan, by the antients called Media
Major, the chief Cities whereof are Ardebil, Tabris, or Tauris, Merrague, Natschan,
Miane, Urumi, Choi, Salmas, &c. Ardebil is one of the most antient and most celebrious Cities

of all the Kingdome, not only by reason of the residence which several Kings of Persia made
there, but also particularly upon this accompt, that Schich Sefi, Author of their Sect, liv'd and
dy'd there. Some are of opinion, that it may be conjectur'd, from the History of Quintus
Curtius, that it is the City which he calls Arbela. In this Citie are to be seen the Tombs and
Monuments of the Kings of Persia; and it is a place of so great Traffick, that it may be justly
numbred among the most considerable of all the East. The Turkish Language is much more common
among the Inhabitants, than the Persian. I found the elevation of the Pole there,
to be at thirty eight degrees, five minutes, and the longitude to be 82. degrees, 30. minutes.
                  It is seated in the midst of a great Plain which is above three Leagues about, and compass'd of
all sides by a high Mountain like an Amphitheatre, the highest part whereof, called Sabelhan, which
lies West-ward from the City, is alwayes cover'd with Snow. Towards the South-South-West,
lies that Mountain of the Province of Kiban, which is called Bakru. It is from these Mountains
it proceeds, that the Air there is sometimes extremely hot somtimes extremely cold; insomuch that
even in August, they begin to be sensible of the inconveniences of Autumn, as also to be troubled
with those Epidemical Diseases, which reign there every year, and commonly carry away
a great number of persons. Nor was our Quarters free from them. For besides the great number
of servants who fell sick, the Ambassador Brugman and our Physician lay in of a Feaver,
but especially the latter, who was reduc'd to that lowness, that there was no hope of Life. In
the greatest heat of the day, and exactly at noon, there rose a kind of a Whirle-wind, which
fill'd the whole City with dust; but it lasted not above an hour. The rest of the day and night
is calm, which gave occasion to the Persian Proverb, Saba Ardebil, Nimrus Kardebil, that is,
In the morning Ardebil, at noon, full of dust.
                  Yet is it not the cold quality of the Climate,The air not so warm as elsewhere. but its Situation that hinders the earth there to
produce Wine, Melons, Citrons, Orenges, and Pomegranates, which are to be had in almost
all the other Provinces of Persia. Apples, Pears, and Peaches thrive very well there. Which
is to be understood of the City it self, and the Plain, in which it is seated: for the Air is incomparably
more hot and more temperate at the foot of the Mountain; whence it comes; that;
thereabouts,The fertility of its soil. you have all sorts of Fruits, and the Trees, which, in April, do but begin to bud
about Ardebil, were very forward at the Village of Alaru, at the foot of the Mountain Bakru.
This particular of fruits only excepted, the soil thereabouts is very good, as well for
arable Lands as Pastures: insomuch that the Plain, which is not very great, is able to maintain
the Inhabitants of above sixty Villages, all which may be seen from the City. Besides all which,
the Revenue which is rais'd for the King, from the Arabian and Turkish Shepherds, is very considerable,
by reason of the Liberty allow'd them to feed their Cattel thereabouts, and to Trade
therewith in those parts, after they have purchas'd the Schach's Protection, or embrac'd the
Religion of the Persians. Some of the Clarks belonging to the Farmers of the Revenue assured
me, that within fifteen dayes before, there had pass'd over the City-Bridge above a hundred
thousand sheep, and for every sheep, they pay four Kasbeki, or two pence sterl, for their pasturage,
and as much when the owner sells them. This last duty is called Tzaubanbeki; and the
other Abschur Eleschur, or the duty of Water and Herbage, which the Turks call in one word
Othbasch.
                  The City is somewhat, but very little, bigger than that of Scamachie, but hath no Walls.
No House but hath its Garden, so that, seen at a distance, it seems rather a Forest, than a City.
Yet are there no other Trees about it than Fruit-Trees, inasmuch as the Country produceing
no Wood fit for Building, nor indeed any for Firing, the Inhabitants are oblig'd to supply
themselves, out of the Province of Kilan, which is six good dayes Journey distant from it.
Within a League of the City, South-ward, lies a Village named Scamasbu, out of which rises
a little River called Balachlu. Before it comes into the City, it divides it self into two branches,
one whereof divides the City, and the other compasses it; and is joyned again to the other, and
so fall together into the River Karasu. It is so apt to over-flow in the moneth of April, when
the Snow upon the Mountains begins to dissolve, that if the Inhabitants of the Plain had not
the industry to divert it by Trenches, which they make on that side which is towards the City,
it would drown them all.
                  Of such an inundation, there happened an Example in the time of Schach Abas, when the
violence of the water having broken the Dikes, over-threw in a moment a great number of Houses;
in regard, the Walls, being built only of Mortar and Bricks bak'd in the Sun, there is
not any able to stand out against the least inundation: so that the River caried away their
Housholdstuff, nay many Children in their Cradles; as it had also near happened at the time
of our being there, upon the 12. of April, when there were a thousand men at work day and
night in making Chanels, and in turning the River by means of a Trench, which was made in
the plain upon the River side, which over-flow'd all the adjacent fields. The City besides a
great number of narrow strees,Its Streets??? hath five very fair and broad ones, named Derwana, Tabar,
Niardower, Kumbalan, and Kasirkuste: in all which they have been at the pains of planting

both sides with Elms and Linden-Trees, to have some shade against the excessive heats of the
Climate.
                  The Market-place, or Maydan, is large and noble, as being above three hundred paces in
length,Its Market-place. and a hundred and fifty in breadth, and having, on all sides, Shops so orderly dispos'd
that no Merchandise, no Profession but hath its particular quarter. On the right hand as you
come into it, you find, behind the Sepulchre of Schich-Sefi, and the last Kings of Persia, a
Metzid or Mosquey, in which lies interred Iman Sade, or one of the Children of their
twelve Saints. Malefactors and Criminals may retire thither for a certain time, and thence
easily get to the Monument of Schich-Sefi,The Spulchre of Schich-Sefi a Sanctuary. which is their great Sanctuary. As you come out
of the Market-place, you come to a place which they call Basar, where the first thing you
meet with is a great square arched Building, called Kaiserie, where are sold all the precious
Commodities of the Country, as Gold and Silver Brocadoes, and all sorts of precious stones,
and silk stuffs,. As you come out thence, you enter, by three Gates, into so many streets, cover'd
over head, all beset with Shops, where are sold all sorts of Commodities. There are also
in these streets, several Caravanseras or Store-houses, built for the convenience of forein Merchants,
as Turks, Tartars, Indians, &c. We saw there also two Chineses, who had brought thither,
to be sold, Porcelane, and several things of Lacque.
                  There are also in the City a very great number of publick Baths, and Metzids, the chiefest
whereof is that which they call,Its Metzids or Mosqueys. Metzid Adine, which is seated upon a little Hill, as it were
in the midst of the City, and hath a very fair Steeple. There, the greatest Devotions are done,
on holy-days, and particularly on Friday, from which it derives the name. At the entrance of
the Metzid, or Church, there is a Fountain, which the late Saru Chotze, otherwise called
Mahomet Risa, Chancellor of Persia; brought to that place, by a Chanel under
ground, from the very source, which is in a Mountain above a League distant from the City,
South-west-ward.
                  The Sumptuous Monuments of Schich-Sefi, and the last Kings of Persia, are near the Meidan.
The Persians call that place, Mesar, and Kibel-Chan, Governour of the City did us
the favour to let us into them, upon Whitsun-Monday. He sent us word before hand, that,
since we were so desirous to see the holy Sepulchre, we must be oblig'd to abstain from
VVine that day, and that our Supper should be brought us out of Schich-Sefi's Kitchin.
                  The Ambassadors went thither immediately after Dinner,The Ambassadors visit Sehich-Sefi's Sepulchre. attended by all their Retinue, and
their Guards. The Gate, at which we entred, to get into the first Court, is a very large
one, and above it there was a great silver Chain, reaching from one side to the other, at
which there hung such another perpendiculary in the middle. It is a Present, which Aga-Chan,
Governour of Merrague, had, out of Devotion, made to the holy Sepulchre.
This first Court is very spacious. and pav'd all over with broad stones, having on both sides
great Vaults, where there are many Shops, and backwards a very fair publick Garden, open
to all.
                  The Governour, having receiv'd us in the Base-Court, brought us to another Gate, over
which there was also a Silver-Chain like the former, and it was an expression of the Devotion
of Mahomed-Chan,,Lay down their Arms at the entrance. Governour of Kentza. At the entrance of this Gate, they demanded
our Arms,, it being not lawful to carry any, of any kind whatsoever, to the place where the
Sepulchre is; insomuch that if a Persian were found but with a knife about him, it would cost
him his life. The threshold of this Gate, as also of all the following Gates, was of white
Marble, and round, and notice was given us not to set our foot upon it, but to step over it, the
right foot foremost, out of this reflection, that having been kiss'd by so many Millions of
Millions of persons, it were, as they said, very irrational that our feet should prophane it.
Thence we enter'd into another Court, which was at least as long as the first, but much narrower,
and pav'd after the same manner, having vaults and shops on both sides as the other.
On the right hand, there came out of the Wall, by a brass-Cock, a fair Fountain (the water
whereof was brought a League distance thence) that they might drink, who retir'd thither out
of Devotion. At the end of this Court, on the right hand, we were shew'd a very fair and
spacious Vault arched above, pav'd without, with green and blew stones, and within, hung
with Tapistry. In the midst of this Vault, there were two fair brass Candlesticks with lights
in them. All along the Walls sate several Priests, cloath'd in white, who sung as loud as ever
they were able, expressing a great humility, and an extraordinary Devotion, by a continual
moving from one side to the other; which motion was performed by them all at the same
time, and with the same shaking, and that with so much exactness, that a man would have
thought they had been all fasten'd to the same Cord, and that they had been all drawn at the
same time.Schich-Sefi's Fast of forty days. This place is called Thschillachane, in regard Schich-Sefi retired thither every year,
to fast, eating only, for 40 days together, but one Almond a day, at least if we may believe
the Relations of the Persians. Thence, we pass'd through a third Gate, over which there hung
also a Silver-Chain, bestow'd on the place, by Alli-Chan, Governour of Kappan, in another

Court which was less than the two precedent, and pav'd all over with little square-stones
of several colours. We entred into the place where the Sepulchre was, by a Gate which was
built like a great Tower, the Clappers whereof were all cover'd with plates of silver, and
adorn'd with several Rings of the same Metal, which Gate brought us into a great Structure.
The pavement before the Gate was cover'd with Tapistry, to express the holiness of the place;
and we were told, that, for the said reason, it was expected, we should put off our
shooes.
                  The Ambassadors, at first, made some difficulty to render that respect, to a place, for which
they could not have any Veneration, but perceiving, that if they did it not, they would not have
been permitted to go in, they at last resolv'd to comply with the custom. The Persians, to let
them know, they did not any thing, that might abate ought of their Dignity, told them, that
Schach-Abas himself, when he came to see the Sepulchre, many times, put off his shooes when
he was come within half a League of the City, and came so far bare-foot; but that they could
not expect that Devotion from us. We pass'd thence into a very fair spacious Gallery, hung,
and cover'd with Tapistry: and afterwards, we entred by another Gate, cover'd with plates of
Gold, into another Sumptuous Structure which was Arch'd all about. Schach-Abas, being
upon the point of his departure, into the War he was then engag'd in against the Vsbeques Tartars,
made a vow, and promis'd, to bestow a Golden Gate on the Sepulchre of Schich-Sei, at
Ardehil, and another upon Iman Risa's at Chorasan, if his Armies had the success he expected:
which vow he very religiously performed, immediately upon his return, having had all the advantages
over his Enemies that his own heart could have wish'd. This Vault was about four fathom
square, and was enlightned by a great number of Gold and Silver Lamps; among which
there were some, above three foot Diameter. On both sides sate twelve Hasifahns, or Priests,
having before them, upon Desks, great books of Parchment, wherein were written, in Capital
Arabian Characters, certain Chapters of the Alchoran, which they sung, much after the same
manner, as our Monks do their Vespers, but with the same motion as we had observ'd at the
Tschillachane. Having gone through that Vault, we came to another appartment, which was
divided from it only by a Silver Rail, though rais'd higher by three silver steps, to get up into
it. The Governour, and our Interpreter Rustan, having kiss'd those steps, he went into it with
the Ambassadors, who took along with them four persons of their Retinue. This apartment
was much more richly adorn'd than any of the rest, and there was at one end of it another place
rais'd a foot from the ground, the Rails whereof were of massy Gold. It is behind that Rail or
Partition, that the Sepulchre of Schich-Sefi is to be seen, built of white Marble, and not of
Gold, as some have written. It was cover'd with Crimson Velvet, and rais'd three foot from
the ground, being about nine foot in length, and four in breadth. From the Roof, there hung
certain Lamps of Gold and Silver, and on both sides, two huge Candlesticks of massy Gold, in
which there were set great Wax Candles, lighted in the night time.
                  The Door of that Golden Rail was lock'd,Laicks not permitted to appreach the Sepulchre. and though the Ambassadors were very importunate
to have it opened, yet could they not prevail, the Persians telling them, that the Laicks,
even to the King himself, were not permitted to come within that place. In the same apartment
where we then were, was to be seen, on the left hand, in a particular Vault, the Sepulchre of
Schach Ismael, the first of that name; as also that of Scach-Sefi's Wife, and those of some
other Queens of Persia: but we were permitted to see no more of them, than we could discover
at the meeting of the Curtains, which were drawn at the entrance of it: and from what we
could judge thereof, there was nothing remarkable. There came all along after us a grave old
man, who, with a perfuming-pot in his hand, purify'd the places, through which we had
pass'd.
                  Having taken notice of all that was to be seen in that place,A miraculous Vault. we were conducted through the
same Gallery, towards the right hand, into another spacious apartment, which was Arch'd all
about and Gilt; where we could not but admire the manner of its building, which being near
as large as a fair Church, was nevertheless sustain'd by the strength of the Roof, and without
Pillars.The Library This Hall is called Tzenetsera, and serves for a Library. The books were lay'd in
Drawers, shuffled one upon another, without any order, but otherwise well enough kept.
They were all Manuscripts, some, upon Parchment, others upon Paper, most in Arabick,
and some in the Persian and Turkish Languages, but all excellently painted, richly bound, and
cover'd with Plates of Gold and Silver, carv'd, and branch'd. The books of History were enrich'd
with several representations in colours. In the Neeches of the Vault, there were above
three or four hundred Vessels of Porcelane; some, so large, as that they contain'd above 40.
quarts or Liquour. These only are used at the entertainments, which are brought from the Sepulchre,
to the King and other great Lords, who pass that way: for the holiness of that
place permits not that they should make use of any Gold or Silver. Nay, it is reported
of Schich-Sefi, that he, out of an excessive humility, made use onely of Woodden
Dishes.
                  Thence we were brought to the Kitchin,The Kitchin the Door whereof was also cover'd with Plates of

Silver, and all things within it were so handsomly ordered, that it was not a little to be admire'd.
The great Cauldrons were all set in a row, and seal'd within the Wall, along which pass'd a
Pipe, which, by divers Cocks, supply'd all the Kitchin with water.
                  The Cooks of all degrees had every one his place,The Charity of the place. according to their functions and employments.
This Kitchin maintains every day above a thousand persons, accompting those belonging
to the house, and the poor, among whom they distribute thrice a day, Pottage, Rice, and
Meat; to wit, in the morning at six, at ten, and, in the after-noon at three. The two morning-meals
are upon the accompt of Schich-Sefi, who, to that end, lay'd a foundation of fifty
Crowns per diem; and the third is an Alms bestow'd there, by order from the King of Persia.
Besides these, there are so many Alms distributed there upon the accompt of private persons,
that there is not only enough to maintain the poor, but there is much over and above, which is
sold to those who are asham'd to beg. At the time of these meals or distributions, they sound
two Timbrels, which, as they say, were brought from Medina, with the Banner of Fatima,
by Schach Sedredin.
                  Going out of the Kitchin, we entred into a very fair Garden, where we saw the Sepulchres of
Sulthan Aider,Sepulchres of the Kings of Persia. Schach-Tamas, and several other Kings of Persia, which were in the open air,
and without any thing over them, but a smooth stone. The principal Lords, whose Sepulchres
are to be seen in this Meschaich, are,

                        1. Shich-Sefi, the son of Seid-Tzeibrail.
                        2. Schich-Sedredin, the son of Sefi.
                        3. Schich-Tzinid, the son of Sedredin, whom some Europaean Authors, erroneously call
Guined.
                        4. Sulthan Aider, the son of Tzinid, who was flead alive by the Turks.
                        5. Schich Aider, the son of Sulthan Aider.
                        6. Schach-Ismael, the son of Schich Aider.
                        7. Schach Tamas, the son of Schach-Ismael.
                        8. Schach-Ismael, the second of that name; the son of Schach-Tamas.
                        9. Schach-Mahomet Choddabende, son of Schach-Ismael.
                        10. Ismael Myrsa, brother of Choddabende.
                        11. Hemsa Myrsa,
                        12. Schach Abas,
                        sons of Choddabende.
                     
                  
                  Schich-Sedredin ordered his Sepulchre to be built,A Fable. after the death of his Father, by an Architect,
whom he had brought along with him from Medina, and according to a Model which he
drew of it himself by Miracle (for the Persians affirm, that both he and his Father wrought
many) which was, that having commanded the Architect to shut his eyes, he ravish'd him into
an extasie, during which, he gave him a sight of the Model, according to which he would
have that Structure built, and according to which it was afterwards done. Schich-Tzinid, adding
thereto the great Court, and several Houses, augmented it so as that now it seems a very
noble and spacious Castle, whither there comes every day so great a number of persons, to
Discourse, or Walk, that there are few Princes Courts where there are more seen. The foundations
of several Kings, its vast Revenues, and the Presents which are daily made thereto, do
so augment the Wealth of it, that some conceive, its Treasure amounts to many Millions of
Gold, and that, in case of necessity, this Mesar might raise and maintain a very powerfull
Army, and that it would furnish more ready Money than the King could himself. Besides the
Farms and Dairies which depend on it, it hath within the City of Ardebil two hundred Houses,
nine publick Baths, eight Caravanseras, or Store-houses, that great Vault, which is called
the Kaiserie, all the Meydan, with its Vaults and Shops, a hundred other Shops in the Basar,
and the Market-places, where Cattel, Wheat, Salt, and Oyl are sold. The Astasnischin, or
Regraters and Hucksters, and those who sell Commodities in open Market, having neither
Shops, nor Stalls, pay certain duties thereto. It is possess'd, about Ardebil, of thirty three
Towns or Villages; and in the Province of Serab, of five Villages. In the City of Tauris, it hath
sixty Houses, and a hundred Shops, and two Villages without the City; several Caravanseras
and Baths, in the City of Casuan, as also in the Province of Kilan and Astara. The duties
of Abschur and Eleschur, in the Province of Mokan belong to it, and one moyety of those of
Chalchat, Kermeruth, and Haschteruth, not accounting what the Tartars and Indians, who
make profession of the Persian Religion send thither, nor the Presents, which are brought from
all parts, in consequence of the Vows, which they are wont to make, in great Journeys, in
their Sickness, nay indeed in any business of Importance, which they very Religiously perform.
Besides all these, there are so many Gifts, Donations and Legacies made to it, that there
passes not a day, but a man shall see going thither Horses, Asses, Camels, Sheep, Money, and
other things. All these things are receiv'd by two Persons, who are oblig'd by an Oath to be
faithful to that sacred place, and they are called Nessurtzchan, from the word Nesur, which

signifies a Vow, and they have an allowance out of the revenue of a fair Village, which is
within half a League of the City, called Sultanabath; which was granted by Schich Ismael, to
that purpose.Commissaries for the reception of the profits. These Commissaries are every day in an apartment on the left hand. as a man
goes into the Metzid Tzillachane, and are set on both sides of a Chest or Box, cover'd with
crimson Velver, into which they put the Money that is brought them, as they do also that
which arises by the sale of those Horses, Camels and Asses, which are bestow'd on the Sepulchre:
for the Oxen and Sheep are kill'd, and distributed among the poor. They give those
who bring them a small Present, which is a handful of Anniseed; and they are given to understand
thereby, that their Souls shall enjoy serenity and blisse in the other
VVorld.
                  They also give the Pilgrims who come thither to do their Devotions, a Certificate of their
being there, and of the Prayers they said there; which serves not only for a Testimony of the
profession of their Religion, but also for a protection against several disgraces and misfortunes.
nay, which is more, for the saving of their Lives. Accordingly, our Interpreter Rustan, having
resolv'd to leave us, and fearing what might follow upon the complaint which the Ambassadors
should make to the King of him, took three authentick Copies of such a Certificate,
whereof two were found among his Cloaths, after his departure, and presented, at our
return, by the Ambassador Crusius, to his Highness of Holstein, in whose Library, they are
still to be seen.
                  The Persians call these Certificates Sijaretname, and they are given, not only here, at the
Sepulchre of Schich Sefi, but also at Meschet, at that of Iman Risa, and these latter are as
efficacious, and have the same authority as the former. Now that it may be understood how
Certificates are able to save the Lives, either of a Malefactor, or a person fallen into disgrace
at the Court, I shall here allege an example of it. Not long before the time of our Travels into
those parts, it happened, that Tzirra-Chan, who was a person of quality, and one so highly
in favour with Schich-Sefi, that he concluded a Marriage between him and one of the Ladies of
his Seraglio, coming one day somewhat late to Dinner, the King ask'd him the reason of it, and
said to him, smiling, that it must needs be the caresses of his new Married Wife, kept him away
so long.The confidence of a Favourite, He had the boldness to make answer, that his Majesty had not miss'd the mark
much, that indeed he had been dallying with a Woman, but that it had been with the Wife
of Agasi-Beg, who was then in the room, and discharg'd the Office of Steward, when Tzirra-Chan
told the story. The King was so startled at that insolence, that, blushing, out of vexation
and shame together, he knew not how to lift up his eyes, to look on either of them: which
Tzerra-Chan observing, and inferring thence, that he had said too much, rose from Table and
went to his own House. As soon as the King had taken notice of his departure, he call'd Agasi,
and said to him, Thou hast seen, Agasi, after what manner Tzirra, not thinking it enough to
have dishonour'd thy House, must needs make ostentation of his lewdness, and reproach thee with
thy infamy, and have the confidence to do it in my presence: Go thy ways, and bring me his head.
Agasi obey'd, and went his way; but about some two hours after, the King much wondring
to find that Agasi was not return'd, sends after him, to know what was become of him. The
King had this account brought him, that Tzirra and Agasi had been found, like very good
friends, making merry, and drinking together. Whereupon, the King not able to forbear
laughing, cries out, ja Kurrumsak, O the poor Cuckold: but immediately after, reflecting on
their procedure, and imagining, that it was joynt design between them to put the affront upon
him,Insolence punished. and that they laugh'd at him in their sleeves; he Commanded Aliculi-Chan, Brother
to Rustan, Chan of Tauris, Divanbeg, or Judge of the Province, to go and fetch both their
heads. In the mean time, Agasi coming to himself, and considering that the King never jested
in things of that nature, and that he might well come to repent his neglect in executing his
Commission, took leave of the company and withdrew; but Tzirra, confident of the King's
favour, and presuming on the familiarity there had been between them, was so imprudent as
to stay, as it were expecting the effects of his Prince's indignation, and had his Head cut off.
Agasi, making his advantage of Tzirra's death, went in the mean time to the Sepulchre of Iman
Rise, whence he brought one of those Certificates, wherewith, some moneths after, he
presented himself before the King; who, perceiving him coming at a distance, could not forbear
laughing, and said to him, I commend thee for thy wit, my honest kind hearted Cuckold, go thy
ways, I pardon thee for Iman Risa's sake; come, kiss my foot. Thus did this Sijaretname or Certificate,
save Agasi Bek's his life, who was afterwards entertain'd again into the Schach's service,
not indeed in the quality of Steward, but only as a Gentleman belonging to his
Chamber.
                  Yet is it not to be thought, but that these Secretaries, of whom such Certificates are obtained,
are gulity of frauds and connivances in the disposal of them, by delivering them signed and sealed,
with blanks to put in the names of such as may have occasion for them; as may be seen by
the Copy which is in his Highness's Library at Gottorp. Of Schich-Sefi, his Life and Miracles,
we shall give an account hereafter, when we come to treat of the Religion of the
Persians.
                  
                     
In the same Village af Kelheran, about a League and a half from Ardcbil, there is another
sumptuous sepulchre, built in honour of Seid-Tsebrail,, the Father of Schich-Sefi. He was a
poor Peasant,Another Saint's Sepulchre. who not able to pretend to any thing particular, which might distinguish him
from the other Inhabitants of the place, had also his Burial common with them. But Sedredin,
finding the reputation of his Father's Sanctity so well establish'd, that it was become in a manner
Hereditary in his Person, would needs have it return backwards to his Grand-father, and
to that end, caus'd his Relicks to be uncover'd, and honour'd them with a Sepulchre, at the
place where it is now to be seen. Some affirm, that in the same Tomb are kept the bones of
Seid-Sala, and Seid Kudbedin, Father and Grandfather of Tzebrail: but others would have all
the honour done to Seid Tzebrail alone. And it is possible they may be all mistaken, it being
very hard, that, after so many years, their bones and ashes could be distinguish'd from those
of so many others.
                  The Tomb it self stood in the midst of a large Garden,The Tomb described. and was built absolutely round, rais'd
ten steps from the ground, adorn'd all about with glass of all sorts of colours, which are preserv'd
by Iron-grates, and had in the midst of its Roof, a great round Tower, built of blew
and green Stones. Those of our retinue, who were desirous to go into it, were forc'd to
leave their shooes and Boots at the door, as also their Swords and their Canes. The building
within was of admirable Architecture. The Roof, which was Azure Gilt, was joyn'd by bowing-Pillars,
through which the light came in. The floor was cover'd with the richest kind of
Tapistry, and the Walls, which were open of all sides, had in them other little Partitions, or
Vaults, where they taught Children to read and sing the Alchoran, so to enable them in
time to become Hasisans, or Guardians of that Holy Sepulchre. We found here and there, upon
little seats, Books lying open, in order to the singing of their Service, after the same manner
as we had seen at the sepulchre of Schich-Sefi. The Tomb was about a man's height, and
an Ell and a half in breadth, of Joyners work, all the Junctures being done over with little
plates of Copper, and all cover'd with a piece of green Velvet. Over the Tomb hung four
Lamps, whereof two were of Gold, the other two of Silver, which two Tziragts Chihan, or
snuffers, were oblig'd to light at the cloze of the Evening, and to keep in all Night. Over against
the Tomb, there was a little Chapel, kept for the Sepulchre of several other persons of
the same Family of Schich-Sefi.
                  From the sanctity of the place,The Governour of Ardebil administers an Oath to the religious men belonging to the Sepulchre. it proceeds, that the Chan of Ardebil, administers an Oath to
the Religious men of the place, for their fidelity thereto, as well as their allegiance to the King,
as being oblig'd joyntly to serve that Holy-sepulchre and the King; whence it may be inferr'd,
he hath a certain spiritual Jurisdiction as well as the temporal. As a privilege whereof, as also
upon the accompt of the situation of his City, which is no Frontier, and consequently not subject
to the invasion of the Turk, the Governour is freed of the charge of maintaining that number
of soldiers, which the other Governours are oblig'd to raise and keep, out of the Revenue
of their Governments.
                  His Retinue was very well ordered, not exceeding fifty persons, to whom his own Temperate
Life serv'd for an Example. He treated us three several times, but was guilty of no excess,
and seem'd to be very temperate in all things, save that he took abundance of Tobacco, sucking
it through a Pipe of Cane which was put into a glass of Water, according to the Persian
mode, and drunk very much Cahwa, or Coffee, to moderate the insurrections of the Codpiece.
                  What is most remarkable about Ardebil,Medicinal Waters. is the sources of Medicinal waters, whereof there
is a great number, and of several sorts, whether in order to Health or Divertisement, to which
the Chan or Governour, proffer'd to bring us, and would have done it, had not the Ambassdors
indisposition, who was then sick, prevented him.
                  What we can say of them upon the relations of the Persians, is, that, at the foot of the Mountain
Sebelan, there is a source called Serdebe, over which Sulfakar-Chan, whom we mention'd
before, built a spacious Vaulted apartment. Its water which is almost luke-warm, and as clear as it
is possible water can be, makes a very pleasant Bath.
                  Three Leagues thence, on the right side of the same Mountain, there is another source, the
waters whereof are so Sulphureous and so corrupt,Sulphureous Sources. that they infect all the circumambient air.
It is excellent good for the Itch, upon which accompt it is called Abcotur, a word which in
the Persian Language signifies that disease.
                  Out of the same Mountain,Sources of hot water. but from another part of it, there arise three other Springs of hot
or boyling water, called Meul, Daudan, and Randau. The first rises out of a little Hill, between
two sources of cold water. Daudau hath also not far from it a cold Spring, the water
whereof is us'd to allay the contrary qualities, by the mixture of their waters, which are brought
by several Conduits into the publick Baths.Serpents discover the wholesomness of the water. Daudau is admirable for the several effects it produces,
being sometimes very wholsome, sometimes of no use at all. To know when it may be
us'd with success, they have this observation, that there may be seen in the water Serpents,
which have on their heads other little white Serpents, set round about them like a Crown. When

there are none of these to be seen in it, the water hath no vertue, so that it is to no purpose to
bath in it.
                  About half a League from the City, upon the right side of the High-way, there is a Pond,
or rather a standing Pool, called Schercol, which is cover'd all over with great pieces of Salt-Peter
and Salt, as with a crust of Ice, whither such as are troubled with the Itch, go and bath
themselves.
                  Having staid two full moneths at Ardebil,JUNE. the first of Iune, came thither a Mehemander named
Abasculi-Beg,The King sends the Ambassadors another Conductor. with orders from the King for our immediate departure thence, he being charg'd
to bring us within six weeks to the Court, where he said the Ambassadors were with much impatience
expected. But being himself an antient man, and consequently not fit to be over-earnest
in travelling, he left with us his son, whose care it was to conduct us to Ispahan. These
new orders oblig'd Netzefbeg, who had been our Mehemander from Scamachie, to take leave
of us. We requited, in some measure, his civilities towards us, with a Present of four pair
of Sables, five Ells of dark grey Cloath, four Ells of green Satin, the like quantity of blew
Satin of Genua, and four bottles of Aquavitae.
                  Abasculi did all that lay in his power to hasten our departure, and was so earnest to find us all
necessary conveniences, that he caus'd the Horses and Camels to be brought to the very Doors of
our Lodgings, the more to oblige us to send away the Baggage. But the Ambassador Brugman,
who was resolv'd to have the brass-pieces, which he had kept till then, brought away along
with us, would needs, in defiance of all perswasion to the contrary, have carriages made for
them. Which to satisfie him in, the Mehemander was forc'd to make use of certain Trees,
which were an Ornament to the City, after many remonstrances, of the impossibility which
he told us we should meet with by the way, to draw Artillery after us. So that we found our
selves insensibly engag'd to make a longer stay there than we expected; for, though they us'd
all possible diligence to make the said Carriages, yet was our journey put off for eight dayes
longer.
                  At last, all things being ready, there was sent to the Chan three pair of the best kind of Sables,
whereof the Persians make very great account, a striking-Clock, a Chest, or Cellar, containing
twelve bottles of Ros Solis, and two pictures, done by our own Painter, representing a Person
of quality and a Lady, dress'd after the French mode. He sent back to the Ambassadors,
each of them an excellent Horse, with their Bridles and Saddles, set out with Silver-plates,
two pieces of Satin, one red the other blew, one piece of Gold and Silver Brocado, one piece
of Cotton-stuff, with flowers of silk, and a piece of Cushion Canvas, with flowers of gold and
silver.
                  Iune 10. the Mehemander brought a hundred and sixty Horses,They leave Ardebil. and twelve Camels, as well
for the Baggage, as the six pieces of Artillery. The next day, we sent away both, and on the
12. followed our selves. The Ambassador Brugman, who was yet weak, though recover'd
of his Feaver, was carried in a Horse-Litter, and went away about five in the morning, attended
by thirty persons of our Retinue. Most of the Inhabitants, who had no notice of our
departure, and had never seen any Litter before, finding it cover'd with Cloath, and compass'd
by men on Horse-back, imagin'd we were going to celebrate some Festival in the Country, and
that the Litter carried the mysteries of our Religion. The Ambassador Crusius went away about
eight, with the rest of the Retinue. Kelbele-Chan was gone before to a Garden, without
the City, expecting the Ambassadors, that he might take leave of them, it being not their
custom, no more than it is in some other places, to conduct Strangers at their departure, with
the same Ceremonies as they had receiv'd them, withall, it being, according to their perswasion,
an incivility, to bring such as they had before kindly entertain'd, out of their Lodgings.
Accordingly, after we had travell'd about a League, we met him in the fields, and with him a
Sulthan of Tabris, who being Marshal in the Persian Army, had about him a considerable number
of people, who were all cover'd with Tygres and Lynx's skins, and by their countenances
discover'd the quality of their Master. The Governour carried the Ambassador Crusius into the
Ottaks, or Huts of the Tartarian shepherds, not much out of the High-way, whither he had
brought abundance of cold Meat, Fruits and Conserves.
                  Having taken leave of him,The Chan takes leave of the Ambassadors. we prosecuted our journey, over a high and craggy Mountain,
till we came to the Village of Busum, which lies in a bottom, four Leagues from Ardebil.
There we over-took our Baggage and our Artillery; but the Wheels of the Carriages were so
spent, that the Ambassador Brugman was, with much ado, perswaded, that it were more convenient
to leave the six greater Pieces there, upon the promise made by the Mehemander, that
he would get an order from the King to the Governour of Ardebil, to have them sent after us,
and to that end, he took the bore and size of them. We took along with us the two little brass
Pieces, weighing each of them 300. weight, and four murchering Pieces.
                  Iune the 13. we continu'd our journey, through very bad way, and over Mountains with
such dreadfull precipices, that not thinking it safe to trust the Beasts with the Litter, wherein
the Ambassador Brugman lay, we had it carried by men. In the Vallies, we found many great

Villages and Huts, and excellent Meadows, all cover'd with fair Cattel. Having travell'd five
Leagues, or better that day, we came at night to a Village called Sengoa, where we found a
Melik,The Province of Chalcal. or Receiver general of the whole Province of Chalcal, which begins at that Village, and
reaches as far as the River Kisilosein. His name was Baindur, and he had succeeded his Father in
that employment, who had been so much in favour with Schach-Abas, that with one of
the VVomen of his Seraglio, whom he married, he gave him two or three great Lordships.
                  The 14. our way lay still over high Mountains,The corruption of the Persian Officers. yet in our way, we pass'd through three
Villages, where our Mehemandar fail'd not, according to his custom, to take up Horses, pretending
they were for us, that the Countrey people might be oblig'd to redeem them. Having
travell'd four farsangs, or leagues, we came into a very pleasant Valley, where we lodg'd near
a delightfull Spring. And whereas we had some occasion to stay there till the next day at noon,
I had the leasure to observe the height of the Sun there, and found, that we were at thirty seven
degrees,Grass-hoppers. and twenty minutes of the Line. In this place, we saw green Grass-Hoppers, which
were above three Inches in length, and one and a half in compass.
                  The 15. presently after Dinner, we set forward on our journey, and the Ambassador Brugman
finding himself a little more hearty, got on Hors-back with the rest. Before we got to the
dreadful Mountain Taurus, which the Persians call Perdelis, we came to a bottom, which presented
it self to our view like an Abyss. We were two hours in getting down to it, and above
three in getting out of it, though between the points of the Mountains, there seem'd not to be
half a League distance. It is a most dangerous passage for Travellers, who are oblig'd to come
in strong parties, for fear of falling into the hands of Robbers, who discover, at a distance, the
number of passengers, and accordingly judge whether they can engage them, or must let them
alone.
                  There runs through the bottom the River Kisilosein,Kisilosein. which falls into it through Rocks and
Precipices, with an inconceivable swiftness, and a noise that stuns the passengers. The waters
of it are whitish; whence it comes that in the Province of Kilan, where it falls into the Caspian
Sea, it is, in Talisman, called Isperuth. Schach-Tamas built a very fair Bridge over it, of Brick,
containing nine Arches. The way was planted on both sides with wild Almond-Trees, Cypress,
and Sena-Trees. Having cross'd the River, we came to the Ascent, which was very
steepy, though it went still winding till it came to the top of the Mountain, and it was so hard
to get up, that to advance ought, we were many times forc'd to step up as if we got up a pair
of stairs: having in the mean time on our left hand, Precipices and Abysses so dreadfull to
look on, that the Mule of a Muscovian Ambassador falling down there, was never after
seen or heard of: insomuch that thinking it not safe to ride it up, we alighted, and led our
Horses.
                  By that time we were got to the top of the Mountain it was night, and that so dark, that we
lost our way, in the absence of our Mehemandar, who had stay'd behind in some Villages in
the bottom. We were gotten into very dangerous wayes, and went still a-foot, though the
trouble we had been at, (which had put us all into a sweat) weariness, and the cold, which
beat into our faces, might well have prevail'd with us to make use of our Horses. We were
three whole hours, ere we overcame the darkness of the night, and all other imaginable inconveniences;
but at last about midnight, we got to the Village of Keintze, four Leagues from our
last Lodging. We stay'd there all the next day, as well in expectation of our Mehemandar,
and to give our Horses a little rest, as to refresh our selves, after the precedent day's weariness,
with the Divertisement, which Wine, our Musick, and the noise of our Artillery could afford
us.The Mehemandars complaint. We intended to give our Mehemandar a sharp reprehension, and reproach him with his
negligence; but he soon stopp'd our mouths, telling us, that he could not but acknowledge
himself oblig'd by his charge, to wait on the Ambassadors, and that he should not have neglected
their service; but that he had not the heart to hear the injurious, and blasphemous expressions,
which fell every foot from the Ambassador Brugman, which yet should not hinder
him from taking order, that we should be plentifully supply'd with Provisions; wherein,
to give him his due, he failed not, and contributed much to the good Cheer we made that
day.
                  The 17. we left Keintze, after the mid-day's great heat was a little over: but our Mehemandar,
instead of Conducting us along the High-way, made us turn on the right hand, and
Lodg'd us in a Village, called Hatzimir, seated in a bottom, which was, of all sides, encompass'd
with Rocks. The Melik, or Receiver of the place, treated us with certain Basins of
fruit, Apricocks and Grapes, which were not fully ripe, and a sack of Wine, wherewith we
made a Collation, which serv'd us for a Supper: for our Cook, presuming we should have kept
the High-way, was gone before us with all the Provisions.
                  Iune 18. we got on Horse-back after Sermon, and Dinner, marching after the rate of a full
trot, between two very sleepy Hills, and we came about midnight to the Village of Kamahl,
which is two leagues or better out of the High-way, and six from our last Lodging, and we

were Lodg'd in several houses, scatter'd up and down, upon three hills. They had taken up
for the Ambassadors a great unfurnish'd house, at the entrance of the Village; but finding
there was no convenienee at all for them, they refus'd to Lodge there; and having left two of
their Guard upon the Avenues of the Village, to give an account of them to the rest of the Retinue,
they took up other Lodgings, and we after their example, though the Country-people,
who were surpriz'd at our unexpected arrival, and could not so soon get their Wives and Daughters
out of the way, deny'd us entrance, and put us to the necessity of taking up Quarters by
force, half-dead as we were with cold, and spent with hard travelling. But we were hardly
laid down, hoping to rest our selves the remainder of that night, when our Trumpet sounding
to horse,The Persians set upon the Ambassadors Guard. made us get out of our Beds, to see what the matter should be. Being come to the
Trumpetter, he brought us to the Ambassadors Lodgings, where we understood that twenty
Persians of the same Village, all hors'd, had set upon, abus'd, and dis-arm'd the Guard which
the Ambassadors had left upon the Avenues of the Village, and that they had kill'd them, if
our Steward, with the Muscovian Interpreter, who, by reason of his sickness, had not
been able to follow us, had not come up to their relief, and made the Persians draw back,
fearing there might be others coming after them. There was a Lieutenant with twenty Musketiers
commanded out, to clear the High-ways all about, and all the Retinue were Lodg'd as
near as could be to the Ambassadors.
                  The 19. we continu'd in the same place, where we caus'd Tents to be pitch'd. Here our
Secretary fell sick of a burning Feaver.
                  The next day, being the 20. we departed thence about two in the moning, and march'd all
the Fore-noon, which was extremely hot, through a vast Plain, where we saw only barren
and heathy grounds.The City of Senkan. About noon we came to the little City of Senkan, six Leagues from Camahl.
The City is not enclos'd with a Wall, but is otherwise sufficiently well built. Within
half a League of the City, we receiv'd from the Governour of Sulthanie, who was then in the
City, a Present of certain Dishes of Aprcocks and Cowcumbers, which were a great refreshment
to us, in that excessive heat and sultriness of weather.
                  At the extremity of the Suburbs we were met by thirty persons on Horse-back, well mounted,
who receiv'd us in the name of the Governour of Sulthanie, whose name was Sewinduc Sulthan.A Horseman had neither hands nr feet.
Among these Gentlemen there was one, who, though he had neither hands nor feet, yet
made a shift to guide his horse, with as much skill as any of the rest. He was son to one of the
principal Inhabitants of the City, who had been heretofore much in favour with Schach-Abas,
the Grand-father of Schach-Sefi, for his Poems, and other excellent Productions of his Understanding;
upon the accompt whereof, he was so well respected at Court; that the King not
only granted him the life of his son, who for some Crimes had deserv'd death, but would also
continue him in his favour, contrary to the custom of the Country, according to which all the
relations of a Malefactor, or unfortunate person, participate of his disgrace or misfortune.
The young man had been guilty of strange debauches and extravagances, even to the Ravishing
of Maids and Women in their houses, so often reiterated, that they became at last insupportable;
so that the Schach ordered him, to have his hands and feet cut off, and caus'd the
stumps of his arms and legs to be thrust into boyling Butter, to stop the blood. He had
wooden hands, crooked at the extremities, wherewith he made a shift to hold his
Bridle.
                  The City of Senkan was heretofore of a considerable bigness,Senkan destroyed by Tamberlane. and famous for its Trading,
before Tamberlane destroy'd it: but what reduc'd it to the condition it is in now, is the Turk,
who hath taken and plunder'd it several times. Yet are there some very handsome houses in it,
and those well furnish'd, in which we were entertain'd with much civility, and our sick people
extremely well accommodated. The Sulthan came to visit the Ambassadors immediately after
their arrival, and made his excuses that he had not met them; which was upon this score, that
having been wounded in the shoulder at the siege of Eruan, and the wound being lately opened,
he could not have waited on us in person. We sent to him our Physician and Chyrurgeon,
who dress'd him; which he look'd on as so great a kindness, that he thought it not requital enough
to send us a Present of several excellent Fruits, but he also doubled the ordinary allowance
of our Provisions.
                  All about this City, there are only Barren and Sandy grounds, which bring forth only Briars
of about the height of a mans hand.
                  About half a League from it,A branch of Mount Taurus. there may be seen a branch of the Mountain Taurus, which
they call Peydar Peijamber, and reaches from North to South, towards Kurdesthan, where
may be seen, as they affirm, the Sepulchre of one of the most antient Prophets, from whom
the Mountain derives its name. At the foot of this Mountain there is a very pleasant Valley,
which is checquer'd up and down with a great number of Villages.
                  Iune 21. having stay'd till the great Heat were over, we left Senkan after Sun-set, taking
our way,Sulthanie. by Moon-light, through a Plain of six Leagues, at the end whereof we came, with
the Sun-rising, to Sulthanie. It had been so calm and cold in the Night, that we had hardly

the use of our Limbs, so that we had much ado to alight. This sudden change, from extreme
cold, to the excessive heats of the next day, occasion'd the falling sick of fifteen persons of our
retinue at the same time, all of a violent burning Feaver, the fits whereof were very frequent,
accompany'd with a benumd'ness of all the Members: but that misfortune hindred not but that
they were set on horse-back, and though to avoid the heats of the day, we afterwards travel'd
only by night, yet were they so far from over-mastering their former weariness, that they
were brought lower and lower. Two of our Guards took occasion to fall out at this place, and
fought a Duel, wherein one of the two, who was a Scotch-man, named Thomas Craig, was
run into the Lights, near the Heart, of which VVound he lay long sick, but at last was
Cur'd.
                  As to the City of Sulthanie,Its situation. it lies at eighty four degrees, five minutes Longitude, and at
thirty six degrees, thirty minutes Latitude, in a spacious Plain, which is not, as Mr. Cartwright
writes, encompass'd of all sides with a great Mountain; but it hath indeed on both
sides, especially on the right hand, the Mountain of Keidar. It makes a great shew at a distance,
by reason of some very sumptuous structures, and a great number of steeples, and great
Pillars, which dazle the eye on the out-side; but within it is in a manner desolate, and when
a man comes near it, he finds the Walls almost even with the ground. It was heretofore one of
the greatest, and noblest Cities of all Persia, being above half a League in length, as may be
yet seen by the marks upon the way of Hamedan, half a League or better from the City, in a
gate which hath belonging to it,Built by Chodabende. and a Tower, which some affirm was heretofore part of the
City Walls. Sulthan Mahomet Chodabende, having joyn'd to his other Territories some part
of the Indies, as also of the Vsbeques, and Turky, built it out of the ruins of the antient City
of Tigranocerta, and made it the seat of his Empire, from whom it derives the name of Sulthania:
inasmuch as heretofore, the Kings of Persia were not called Schachs, as they are now,
but they assum'd the quality of Sulthan, as the Grand Seigneur does. Chotza Reschid, King of
Persia, whom Ios. Barbarus calls Giansam, destroy'd some part of the City of Sulthania, upon
a Rebellion of the Inhabitants, and what he had left, Tamberlane made an end of. We saw
there the ruins of a very fair Castle, which had serv'd the King for a Palace, and the City for
a Cittadel, there being yet standing some part of its Walls, all built of square pieces of freestone,
and adorn'd with a great number of quadrangular Towers. The noblest buildings in it,
or Emerat, is the Metzid or Mosquey, where is to be seen the Sepulchre of Mahumed Chudabende.
It hath three gates, very much higher than those of St. Marks at Venice, and
are not of Brass or Copper, as Bizarrus relates, but of Steel, polish'd, and wrough Damask-wie.
                  The greatest of the three gates, which is over against the Meydan, or Market-place,
would not open, as they affirm, even though twenty of the strongest men could be chosen
should endeavour all they could to thrust it open, if they do not pronounce these words, Beask
Aly Bukscha,A likely story. that is, be opened for Aly's sake, and then the Gate turns to and fro upon its
hindges, with so much ease, that, no Child but may open it. The whole roof which grows
narrower and narrower up towards the top, is built with white and blew stones, which, in several
places, have very fair Characters, and excellent Figures done upon them. One part of
the structure was divided from the other by a brass Grate or Rail, for the Sepulchre of Mahomet
Chudabende, making a kind of Quire, where we saw several old Arabick Books, above
half an Ell square, having Letters as long as a man's finger, and black and golden Lines alternately.
I made a shift to get some of the Leaves, which I still very carefully keep in the Prince's
Library.A Paraphrase of the Alchoran. It is some part of the Paraphrase upon the Alchoran, which they call Serats Elkulub,
or Candle of the Heart, and begins with a Fable, the relation whereof the Reader may
haply think worth his reading. He says then, that God banish'd the Devils, and had shut Heaven
Gate upon them, yet had they still a desire to know what the Angels did, and what they
said of the good or ill fortunes of men, that they might give them notice thereof, by the means
of Fortune-tellers and Sorcerers. To dive into these secrets, they thought the only way was
to get up on one anothers shoulders, till such time as the last could put his Ear to Heaven Gate.
God perceiving their temerarious attempt, darted on the head of the foremost of them a Star,
which is called in Arabick Schihab, which striking through all the Devils immediately reduc'd
them to ashes: But that this judgement hinders not, but that sometimes the Devils make use of
the same means, to endeavour to dive into the secrets of Paradice, though they are often punish'd
for it. Thence is it, that when the Persians see one of those Meteors, which to our
sight appear as Stars,The superstition of the Persians. and seem to fall down to the earth, they rejoyce thereat, and pronounce
these words.
                  
                     Chodanike dascht mat a es schitan,
                     Hme busuchtend we ma Chalas sehudim.
                  
                  That is to say, God of his goodness keep us from the Devil; they shall all be reduc'd to ashes, and
we shall be delivered from them.
                  
                     
The Sepulchre of Sulthan Mahomed Chodabende is to be seen through a grate of admirable
workmanship, at the end of the Temple, on that side where the Meherab or Altar, stands.
This grate is certainly one of the noblest things that are to be seen all over Persia, being made
of Indian Steel, polish'd and wrought Damask-wise, the Barrs being about the bigness of a
mans arm, and so neatly wrought that the Junctures are hardly discernable. Nay some affirm
it is all of a piece, and that there were seven years spent in the doing of it, at the end whereof
Chodabende had it transported from the Indies, together with the Gates of the Mosquey, to the
place where they are now to be seen.
                  There were in the same Emerat,Artillery. twenty brass Guns and a Mortar-piece, and among the rest,
four pieces of Battery, the others Culverings, all set upon carriages with four wheels. The
Mortar-piece was mark'd with a spread Eagle, above which were these two Letters A. and Z.
and under it an A. The Balls were of Marble. The Tower was built in the form of an Octogone,
and compass'd about with a great Gallery, which had eight little Towers, up to which
there was an ascent by eight low steps. At the entrance of the Mosquey there was a square
Fountain, into which the water was brought from a Spring rising out of the Mountain Keider.
There is also belonging to it a very fair Garden, and a Summe-house.
                  There is in the same City another fair Mosquey, founded by Schach Ismael, the first of that
name. The entrance into it is through a very fair and large Gate, over which there is a round
Tower: and the first thing offers it self to your view is a noble Pyramid, somewhat decay'd at
the top, having about it eight fair Pillars of Marble. Then is it that you come into the Mosquey
it self, which is very high and well arched, having a great number of Pillars which
up-hold the Roof, with pleasant Galleries, and in the midst a rich Pulpit. This also hath
a fair Garden belonging to it, in the midst whereof there is a Tower, whose point ends in a
Pyramid.
                  These structures do in some measure oblige us to credit what Paulus Iovius sayes,Tamberlane had a respect for the Mosqueys. in the 14.
Book of his History; as also what F. Perodin confirms, in the Life of Tamberlane, to wit, that
that barbarous Commander, who over-ran all that lay in his way like a Torrent, yet express'd
a certain respect for those things, which were, though out of superstition, accompted
sacred.
                  Near this Mosquey there is also to be seen another great Gate, of free-stone, between two
Pillars, twenty fathom high, which seems to be antique, and had been built at the Ceremonies
of some Triumph; but it begins now to decay.
                  The City hath about six thousand Inhabitants, who wondred very much to hear us relate,
that some of those who have published their Travels into Persia, would make the World believe,
that the cold weather forc'd them in the Winter time to forsake the City, and change
their Habitations. For, it is so far from being true, that there are many places in Persia, where
the cold obliges the Inhabitants to change their Habitations, that, on the contrary, it is an effect
ordinarily caus'd there by the Heat.
                  True indeed it is, that there are some places in that Kingdome, where the cold is very incommodious,
by reason of the scarcity of firing, as for instance, near Eruan, at a place called
Deralekes, as being seated between two Mountains, and especially at the Village of Arpa. But
it is not so great as to oblige the Inhabitants to change their Habitations: for they only quit
their upper Rooms, and retire into Cellars, built very deep under ground, not only to serve
them for a place of retirement in the Winter time, against the cold, but also in Summer, against
the heat.
                  Iune 25. we left Sulthanie,The Women travel in great Chests after we had staid there three dayes, which were spent up and
down the Country, in getting us fresh Horses and Camels. The sick persons, who by reason
of their weakness, were not able to ride on Horse-back, were dispos'd into such Chests, as the
Women make use of when they travel. The Persians call them Ketzawhea, and they are put
on Camels backs, like Carriers packs. The Physician and my self were set upon the same Camel,
whereby we were put to two great inconveniences, one proceeding from the violent Motion
caus'd by the going of that great Beast, which at every step, gave us a furious jolt; and
the other, from the insupportable stink of the Camels, whereof there being but one Boy to guide
eight or ten, they were ty'd one to another, and went all in a file, insomuch that the infectious
smell of all that went before, came full into our Noses.
                  We departed two hours before Sun-rising, and travell'd that day six Leagues, through a very
fertil Country, all arable and pasture Lands, leaving, on the left hand, the little Mountains
called Tzikitzki, where the King of Persia's best Race-Horses and Mares for breed are kept.
About noon we took up our Lodging at the Village of Choramdah, which lies on the side of a
little River, having so many Trees and Gardens about it, that it is not without reason that name
is given it, which signifies, a place of Pleasure.
                  The 26. we departed thence in the night, and travell'd five Leagues or better, over Mountains
and Valleys.
                  The 27. we departed at mid-night, and, having travell'd five Leagues, we were got, by Sunrising,

near the City of Casuin, or Cashan; but that the Daruga, who had the Command of it,
might have the leisure to set his affairs in order for our entrance, our Mehemander carried us to
a Village were we staid above two hours till such time as the Daruga came to receive us. This
entrance was not accompany'd with the same Ceremonies as we had seen in other places, in regard
the Governour, having not the dignity of Chan, could not express the same Magnificence.
Yet was it handsom enough, in as much as the Daruga came attended by five or six hundred men,
horse and foot. There came also to meet us an Indian Prince, accompany'd by some Gentlemen
on horse-back of his own Countrey, and follow'd by a great number of Lacqueys and Pages.
He came in a kind of Chariot, having one other person with him in it. The Chariot was
drawn by two white Oxen, which had very short necks, and a bunch between the two shoulders,
but they were as swift and manageable as our horses. The Chariot was cover'd above,
and lay'd over two Wheels, which instead of an Axletree, turn'd upon a piece of Iron, made
so crook'd at the middle, that it bore the weight of the whole Chariot. The Charioteer sate
before, and guided the Oxen, fasten'd to a Beam, which was made fast to the Horns, with a
Cord drawn through their Nostrils.
                  Being come within 500. paces of the City, we met with fifteen young Ladies, excellently
well mounted, very richly clad in Cloath of Gold and Silver, &c. having Neck-laces of great
Pearls about their necks, Pendants in their ears, and abundance of other Jewels. Their faces
were to be seen, contrary to the custom of honest Women in Persia. Accordingly, we soon
found, as well by their confident carriage, as the accompt given us of them, that they were
some of the Eminent Curtezans about the City, who came to entertain us with the Divertisement
of their Musick. They march'd before us, and sung, to the sound of certain Hawboyes,
and Bag-pipes, that went before them, making a very extravagant kind of Harmony. And
that we might be sure to see the City, we were carried quite through it, and Lodg'd on the
other side thereof.
                  As we pass'd through the Meydan, we saw several persons playing on Timbrels, and Hawboyes,
who, joyning with the other Musicians, accompany'd us to our Quarters. The people
came also thither in great numbers, some of them having it put into their heads, that there
were in the Ketzawehas, some great Beauties, whom we carried as ents to the King: but
when they saw sick persons with great beards coming out of them, they hung down their heads,
and made all the haste they could away.
                  I found this City,The situation of Caswin. conformably to the Calculation of the Persians and Arabians, at 85. degrees
Longitude, and at 36. degrees, 15. minutes Latitude. It is one of the principal Cities of
the Province of Erak, which is the ancient Parthia, wherein is comprehended as well Sulthania,
as all the other Cities,Is the antient Arsacia. froth this place as far as Ispahan. It was antiently called Arsacia, and
it is seated in a great sandy Plain, having, within half a dayes journey of it, Westward, the
great Mountain of Elwend, which reaches towards the South-west, as far as Bagdat or Babylon.
The City is a farsang, or good German league in compass, but hath neither Walls, nor any
Garrison kept in it,Hath above 100000. Inhabistants. by reason it lies at so great a distance from the Frontiers. Yet hath it, with
these disadvantages, above a hundred thousand Inhabitants, whereof, if there were occasion
for them, a good part might be put into Arms. Their Language is the Persian, but somewhat
different from the common Dialect,Its Language. whence it comes that it is not so intelligible to the other
Persians, being much after the rate that the German Language is to the Hollanders. The houses
are all of Brick bak'd in the Sun, according to the Persian way, having not any Ornament
without, but within, they are very well furnish'd, as to Vaults, Wainscoats, Paintings, and other
Houshold-stuff.
                  The Streets are not pav'd, whence it comes, that, upon the least wind, the City is fill'd with
dust. It hath no other water than what is brought by aqueducts from the Mountain of Elwend,
into Cesterns, wherein it is preserv'd. No house almost but hath a particular place for the
keeping of Ice and Snow, for the Summer. VVe were forc'd to get into these, to avoid the excessive
heat.
                  Heretofore,The antient residence of the Kings of Persia. the Kings of Persia had their ordinary residence at this place, at least, ever after
Schach-Tamas transferr'd the Seat of the Empire from Tauris to this City. Some attribute that
translation to Schach-Ismael, though the continual VVars he was engag'd in, suffered him not
to stay long in any one place. But it is not question'd but that he built the noble Palace which
stands near the Maidan, which hath belonging to it a fair Garden, adorn'd as well without as
within, with Guilding, Painting, and such other embellishments as are in use among the
Persians.
                  There was another Garden opposite to this Palace,Its Palace. which was above half a league in compass,
and had several little Structures within it. This was one of the most pleasant Gardens
that I ever saw, not only by reason of the great number of all sorts of Trees, as Apples, Pears,
Peaches, Apricocks, Pomegranates, Almonds, and other Fruit-trees, but also by reason of
the fair walks of Cypress, and the Trees called Tzinnar which gave us a very pleasant Prospect.
                  
                     
This City hath two great Market-places. Cartwright names the bigger of the two Atmaidan,
and says, that, in the Persian Language, it signifies a Horse-market. I could never find,
that in any part of Persia,Markets. there was a Market, purposely for the buying and selling of Horses:
whereupon, considering with my self that the Persians, who call, by the general name of
Maidan, all those Markets, where all things are indifferently sold, I imagine, that Author's
mistake proceeded hence, that, being ignorant of the Arabick, he read Atmaydan, for Almaidan,
al, being the Article, without which the Persians and Arabiaas never pronounce the
word Maidan. The greater of these Maidans, or Market-places, is somewhat longer, but
not so broad as that of Ardebil, and hath, on the South-side, several great places, built by
some of the Chans and Persian Lords. The most magnificent amongst them are those of Allawerdi-Chan,
Governour of Schiras; that of Aliculi-Chan, President of Justice; that of Mahomet-Chan,
Chan, or Governour of Kentze; and that of Sehich-Achmed-Chan, who was
great Provest in the reign of Schach-Abas. The other Market-place is called Senke-Maidan,
and is towards the West part of the City. In both the Market-places, as also in the Bazars,
or Shops and Store-houses, which are in the cover'd streets, there may be seen a great number
of Merchants, and abundance of Commodities, which are to be bought there at a very reasonable
rate.
                  I my self bought Turqueses there, which they call Firuse, and are found in great quantities
near Nisabur,Turqueses and Rubies vary cheap. and Firusku, of about the bigness of a Pea, nay, some as big as little
Beans, for two shillings, or two and six pence at the most. Rubies and Granates were also very
cheap there.
                  In the Evening, after the shops are shut, there is, on the East-side, another kind of Commodity
exposed to sale, to wit, a considerable number of the Cabbeha, or common Traders, who
there prostitute themselves to any that will take them up. They all sit in a row, having their
faces cover'd with a Veil, and behind them there stands a Bawd, whom they call Delal, who
hath by her a bed, and a quilted coverlet, and holds in her hand a Candle unlighted, which,
when any Customer comes, she presently lights, that he may look the Wench in the face, and order
her to follow him, whom he likes best among them.
                  On the East-side of the City lies the Church-yard,The Sepulchre of Hossen Son??? where there is to be seen, in a fair Mosquey,
the Sepulchre of Schahesade Hossein, one of the sons of Hossein, at which the Oaths taken
in Law-sutes are administred; a custom which is also observed in all other parts of Persia, at
the places where there are any Sepulchres of Saints, or those of any of their kined. Whence
it comes, that the Persians, when they make some difficulty of crediting what is said to them,
immediately ask, Scahe Sade Hussein, pile Musef; that is, dar'st thou affirm that upon the
Saints Sepulchre, or upon the Alchoran? Besides this Mosquey or Metzit, there are about fifty
more,  whereof is that which they call Tzame Metzid, where they assemble on
Fridays  prayers.
                  There  the City of Caswin many Caravanseras,Caravanseras. for the convenience of foreign Merchants,
and a great number of publick Baths. There is one behind the Garden belonging to the
King's Palace, which they call Haman Charabe. It is now half destroy'd, and there is a story
told of it, which I conceive pleasant enough to deserve insertion into this Relation. They say,
that there lived heretofore at Caswin a very famous Physician,The fabulous story of Lokman. named Lokman, a black Arabian,
who had acquired so great reputation, not only by the Books he had written in Medicine,
but also by many other excellent productions of his understanding, that the Inhabitants
have still a very great Veneration for his memory. Nay it is to be found in their Kulusthan, that
they gave him the surname of Wise, when in the 2. Book, ch. 16. they say, Lokman hakimra
kuftendi Aedebeski amuchti? Kust, es biedbahn. Herstze ischan kerdend, men pertis Kerdem.
That is, that the wise Lokman, being asked one day by what means he had attain'd so great Learning
and Knowledge, he made answer, it was by means of the ignorant and uncivil, for he had
always done what was contrary to what he had seen them do. This Lokman having attain'd a great
age, and being upon his death-bed, sent for his Son, and told him, that he would leave him
an inestimable Treasure, and having commanded to be brought him three Glasses, full of certain
Medicinal waters, he said they had the vertue to raise up a Dead man to Life, if they
were apply'd before the body began to corrupt. That, casting upon the Deceas'd the water
which was in the first Glass, the Soul would return into the Body, that, upon the pouring of
the second, the Body would stand upright; and that upon the third, the Person would be absolutely
alive, and should do all things as before; that however he had very seldome made use
of this Experiment, out of a fear of committing a sin, by undertaking to intermeddle with
that which is reserv'd to God alone; and that out of the same Consideration, he exhorted him
to be very careful how he made use of it, as being a secret rather to be admir'd, than put often
to experience. With these exhortations Lokman dying, his Son was very mindful of the advice
he had given him, and cending the same tenderness of Conscience as his Father had express'd
before him, he reserv'd the Glasses till he might have occasion to make tryal of them
upon himself. Accordingly being at the point of Death, he commanded a man that waited on

him, to make use of those Glasses, as his Father had taught him. The man having caus'd his
Master's Body to be brought into the Bath we spoke of before, poured upon it the two first
Glasses, which wrought the effect, which Lokman had promised they should; insomuch that
the Master sitting up, and impatient to return to Life, cries out, bris, bris, that is to say, pour,
pour; at which words the fellow was so frightned, that he let the third Glass fall down to the
ground; so that the unfortunate Lokman Sade was forc'd to lye down again, and take the
Journey which all other Mortals do. The Persians confidently affirm, that, near this ruinous
Bath, that Voice af bris, bris, is still many times heard. They relate several other stories of this
Lokman, but I shall forbear any account of them, thinking it enough to have produced one, to
shew the vanity of all the rest.
                  Some years since, in the time of King Abas, a certain man named Risa, began to take upon
him the quality of Schich,Risa a false Prophet. or Prophet, and to broach a new Doctrine, imagining he might
in time, acquire the same credit and authority, as had before rais'd Schich-Sefi to so great reputation.
The humour of the Persians, who are extremely addicted to novelty, brought after
him, in a short time, above thirty thousand men, who, cajoll'd by the apparent sanctity of this
new Prophet, were become followers of him. Schach-Abas, fearing this novelty might disturb
the quiet of his Country, sent for Risa, making him believe, that he was desirous to be
instructed in the particulars of his Doctrine: but when he was come, the King commanded
him to confirm it by miracles, which Risa not able to do, he put him to death as an
Impostor.
                  It will not be amiss here to give some accompt how the Indian Prince came to live at Caswin,The History of the Indian Prince???
when we came into those parts. The great Mogul, who liv'd in the time of Schach-Abas, left,
at his Death, two Sons: The elder, who succeeded the Father, soon after died, leaving behind
him only that Myrsa Polagi, whom we found at Caswin, who was but very young
when his Father died. Choram, youngest Son of that Mogul, and Uncle to young Polagi,
took his advantage of that Conjuncture, to usurp the Crown, and accordingly he was King of
Indosthan at the time of our Travels into Persia. The cruelty of Choram's reign, and the mild
nature and inclinations of Polagi, who in the mean time was arriv'd to a considerable age, drew
upon him the affections of the People, and the hatred of his Uncle. In so much, that Choram,
perceiving that it was the design of the Indians to bring his Nephew into the Throne, would
prevent them, by dispatching Polagi out of the way, who having notice of his Uncles wicked
intentions against him, retires into Persia, and puts himself under the Schach's Protection.
All the time before, his Residence had been at Ispahan, where the King allow'd him a pension
of 12000 Crowns per an. but he was oblig'd then to retire to Caswin, by reason of a solemn
Embassy, which the Mogul sent to the King of Persia, purposely to demand him; though that
during the space of three years that the said Ambassador had been there, he had not prevail'd to
have him delivered up.
                  The Kings of Persia live in perpetual jealousie of the Indians, with whom they never have
any assured peace, by reason of the Frontiers of Candahar, which finds Exercise for both sides,
as those of Babylon do on the Turks side: insomuch that the Persians take their advantage of any
occasion, to foment the discontents of the Grandees, as they do any other distractions tending
to Civil War. Whence it comes, that they never deny their Protection to the Indian Princes,
who are willing to retire into Persia, to oblige by that means the Mogul to assist them against
the Turk, and to continue the Commerce, which the Persians have with the Indians, from
which Persia derives so great advantages, that the obstruction thereof would be an infinite loss
to it. There are several instances of these Protections under Schach-Ismael, and Schach-Tamas.
Under the reign of the latter it happened, that Selim, who, as eldest of the House, had succeeded
his Father, died soon after, leaving only one Son, very young, named Humajun. Tzelaledin
Ekber, younger Brother to the Deceas'd, who slighting the infancy of his Nephew,
takes possession of the Scepter, and the more to assure himself thereof, he had a design to murther
the right heir of the Crown. Humajun had notice of it, and got to Persia. Tzelaledin
hearing of it, sent to demand him, with this message to the King of Persia, that if he sent him
not back, he would come and fetch him away with all the forces of his Kingdom. Schach-Tamas,
who was then engag'd in an open War against the Turks, not thinking it prudence to disoblige
so powerful an Enemy,Schach-Tamas's evasion. caus'd Humajun to be hidden, and that he might not make a
false Oath, when he was to give an answer to the Embassy of Tzelaledin, he put him into a
Cage, and caus'd that to be hung in a Tree, while he was to give Audience to the Ambassador,
to whom he protested, that, Humajun nist der chakimen; Humajun is not upon my Lands, and
dismiss'd the Ambassador with that answer. But having, afterwards, made a Peace with the
Turk, he sent Humajun with a powerful Army, commanded by Mehediculi Sulthan, against
Tzelaledin, who was so startled to find himself set upon by so strong an Enemy, that he
was forc'd to run away. Humajun desirous to requite the services of Mehediculi, bestow'd on
him Lordships and great wealth in the Province of Kulkende, where he settled himself, with the
consent of Schach-Tamas, and where his Posterity still live in much credit and authority.
                  
                     
The Ambassadors sent some of the retinue to visit the Prince Polagi, who receiv'd them, sitting
on a cushion of Velvet, near a Fountain, about the border of whose Basin there was cast
pieces of Tapistry,The Ambassadors send to visit the Indian Prince. the ground-work Gold and Silver, and he had about him a great number of
Servants and Domesticks. He took this for so great a civility and kindness from the Ambassadors,
that he thought it not enough to express how sensible he was thereof in words, but would
needs treat those that had been sent to him with a Collation of Wine and Fruits, and told them,
that being not in a condition to entertain them, as he wish'd, out of his own Estate, he was
forc'd to borrow of the Kings favours to make them that treatment. The Ambassadors intended to
have given him a personal visit, but the Persians would by no means permit it, alleging it was
against the custom of the Country; where Ambassadors are not permitted to make any Visits
before they have had audience of the King.
                  Iuly 2.JULY the Daruga invited the Ambassadors to a Divertisement,The Governour gives the Ambassadors a Divertisement. which he had appointed to
be made on purpose for them. It was to be seen in the great Maidan, or Market-place, where
he had caused Tents to be pitch'd, to keep off the heat of the Sun, and some part of it to be
sprinkled with water, to avoid the inconvenience of the dust. Having dispos'd the people into a
ring all about the place, and seated the Ambassadors on high seats, there came in, first, certain
persons who were excellent at Vaulting and shewing feats of Activity. After them came in three
pair of Wrastlers, most naked, having nothing cover'd about them, but what nature would
have to be so. Only two among them had Leathern drawers on, done over with Oyl, who discover'd
a miraculous activity and strength of Body. After these had shewn all could be expected
from persons of their quality, there were brought in two Rams, which run very furiously
one at the other; as also two Birds, somewhat bigger than Parrots, which fought with great
animosity. After these, there came in, with the noise of Timbrels, eight Wolves of extraorginary
bigness, fasten'd to long Ropes, which they let out five or six times one after another
among the people, but drew them back ere they did any hurt. And at last came in a man cover'd
with a thick Mattress, who went boldly to one of the Wolves, took him up by the Body, and
carried him away.
                  The Prince Polagi would have given us the Divertisement of his Elephant, which he sent for
to be brought thither; but he being then at Grass, it was so long ere they could bring him,
that the Ambassadors, who were already weary of a Divertisement, which had lasted but too
long, and found themselves prejudic'd by the heat, went home to their Quarters. Some dayes
afterwards,Elephant??? we had a sight of that Elephant, at the Prince's Lodgings, and we were not a little
astonish'd at his monstrous bulk, which exceeded the height of any two men, as being indeed
without comparison much bigger than any of those we afterwards saw at Ispahan, where there
was a great number of them. His leggs were bigger than any man about the waste, and his
ears came down along his head, half an ell in length, or better. He could do many tricks, and
was govern'd by a little Boy, who by touching him in the fore-head with a little pole-axe, very
sharp at the point, guided him, and made him lye down and rise up as he pleas'd. Whence
may be corrected the Errour of the antients,An error of the Antients. who were of opinion, that the Elephant could not
lye down, as  joynts in his Legs, and that that natural defect was the occasion of his
taking, when coming to rest himself against Trees half sawn asunder, his weight forc'd them
down, and that falling with them, he was not able to rise again. Those, who have written of
the affairs of the Indies, have given an accompt of the manner how they are taken, and therefore
we shall forbear troubling the Reader with it here.
                  The City of Caswin hath, towards the South-South-west, the Mountain of Elwend, which
is a branch of Mount Taurus,The Mountain of Elwend. and the most considerable Mountain of any in Persia, for its vast
and noble quarries, out of which white Marble is gotten, whereof there is such abundance, that
there is enough to supply the whole Kingdome. The Persians relate a pleasant story of a thing,
which, were it true, would be very remarkable; but admitting it is not, we shall nevertheless
insert it here, as we have it from them, upon occasion of this Mountain.
                  They say then,A pleasant story. that, heretofore, a certain King of Persia named Suhak Maran, who was
much pleas'd in taking journeys up and down, would needs once find out some means to have
made in the open fields, some Iauchas, which is a kind of baked paste, used by the Persians instead
of Napkins. The Devil, desirous to make his advantage of this irregular desire of the
Kings, presented himself to him in the shape of a man, made him an Oven, which a Camel
might easily carry, and desir'd of him no other reward, than that he might kiss the King's
shoulder. There was no difficulty made to grant him a thing of so little consequence; but the
Devil, instead of kissing the King's shoulder, apply'd his teeth thereto, takes away a piece of
it, and immediately vanishes. Out of the wound, there came two Serpents, which were perpetually
biting at the head and ears of that miserable Prince, to get out his brains; and though
they were often cut off, yet there immediately starrted up others in their room. The Devil, who
had done all the mischief, having disguis'd himself like a Hakim, or Physician, went and made
proffer of his service at the Court, and prescrib'd a remedy, which was as bad, if not worse,
than the evil it self. He said, that since those Serpents were so desirous to feed on the brains of

a man, and that, as it should seem, it was their only sustenance, the best course were, every
day, to kill two men, and to feed them with their brains. One of the chiefest Grandees about
the Court, moved with compassion, to see daily so much innocent Blood spilt, and considering,
that by the means of so many murthers, the number of the King's Subjects would be infinitely
diminish'd, ordered that there should be two men brought to the Stake, as they were wont before,
but that only one should be kill'd, and that with the mans brains, those of a Sheep, then
also new kill'd, should be mixt, and that that should be the allowance of the Serpents. Which
project took so successfully, that the said Lord perceiving, that the Serpents were not sensible
thereof, he, at last, caus'd the two men to be convey'd out of the way, and made use only of
sheeps brain. Among those who had most contributed to the nourishment of these Beasts, a
Black-Smith, named Churdek, was one, by which means almost all his Children had been upon
that accompt destroy'd; so that, of seventy six Sons, that he had had, only two were left.
Growing desperate upon so great a loss, he represented to the other Inhabitants of the City,
that it was impossible for them to endure that Tyranny long; that there was no likelyhood
nature should have brought them all into the world, to be sacrifiz'd to the appetite of one particular
man; that it were better to rid themselves of the Tyrant, and in regard the State could
not be without a Governour, that it was his advice, they should bring in Kechosrow ben Fridun,
who had been put out by Suhak, and was then Living, in the Deserts of the Mountain of Elwend.
This Counsell was approv'd by the people, who desirous to have it put in Execution by
the person who had given it, entrusted the Black-Smith with the management of that great enterprize,
who, having fasten'd his Leathern apron to an Iron hook, led on the rest of the Malecontents,
and seiz'd the Person of Suhak. They went afterwards to the Mountain of Elwend,
where they found Kechosrow among the wild Beasts, and restor'd him to his Throne. The first
request that Kechosrow made to the people was, that Suhak might not be put to death; which
was granted, but they carried him to the Mountain of Demawend, which reaches from that of
Elwend, towards Teheran, where they made him go into a Cave, and hung him up by the feet.
They say, he is there Living to this day, and that the place of his punishment is known by a
sulphureous stink that comes out of it. Whereto they add, that when a stone is cast into the
Cave, there comes out a voice??? which sayes Tzira miseni mera? that is, Why dost thou fling
stones at me? They say also, that Kechosrow so regulated his expences, during the whole time
of his Reign, that he gather'd vast Treasures together, and that he put it up in the Mountain
Bakru in the Province of Kilan, hiding it so safely, by the means of a Thelesmat or Talisman, that,
till there happen a Conjuncture of the same Stars, it will never be discover'd. They say the
place is known, but that when any come near it, there arise certain winds, which not only
blow out the lights, but also overturn the men who bring them.
                  But the truth of all this story, is, that there are many Sulphureous Mines in those Mountains,
and that the winds, which reign there, are very natural, and ordinary, as well there as
in several other Provinces of Persia; as we had observ'd before at Ardebil. Nor is it unlikely
that there may be a mystical sense of this relation, and that the Persians, who are much addicted
to teach their Morality under Fables, would, by this fabulous History; demn those Princes,
who, to satisfie their irregular passions, are apt to hear flatterers, who being ever guilty
of wicked intentions, never give any good advice, and, to prevent the inconveniences arising
thereby, apply remedies that are much more dangerous than the evil it self, and such as not
only are destructive to the people, but also putting them into despair, animate them into rebellion
against their Princes, who are, by that means, brought to great misfortunes.
                  Iuly 13. we left Caswin;The Ambassadors leave Caswin. the sick persons and the Baggage were sent away in the evening,
the Ambassadors follow'd the same night. The next day, the 14. having travell'd through a
Plain of three Leagues, we came to the Village of Membre, whereof all the Houses were cover'd
like Vaults, so that looking on it at a distance, the whole Village seem'd to consist of so
many Ovens. The Ambassador Crusius, the principal person of the Embassy, began, at this
place, to complain of some indisposition: insomuch that, not being able any longer to ride on
Horse-back, he was for some dayes following carried in a Litter. Our Minister was grown so
weak, that, not able to endure the jolting of the Horse, he alighted ever and anon, and lay upon
the ground, thinking by that means to get some ease. Monsieur Mandelslo was the only person,
who had no touch of any sickness all along our Travels; whence it came, that he had the
more convenience of observing all the particulars thereof; which he hath done with so much
exactness, that his Notes might make a considerable Volume.
                  We travell'd that night seven Leagues, and were got the next day, being the 15. very betimes
in the morning, to a fair Village, named Araseng. We found there, in a Garden which was
seated on the right side of a Torrent, good store of Pomegranates and Almonds, which were a
great refreshment to us. In the evening, we prosecuted our travels, and got six Leagues further,
over a very smooth Mountain, and Lodg'd the 16. in the morning, at a Caravanscra, named
Choskeru. It was all built of Free-stone, and had several Vaults and Chambers, dispos'd all about
a spacious Court, in the midst whereof there was a Well, compass'd by an Iron-rail. Upon

the Walls of several Rooms, were to be seen the names and devises of several persons of most
Nations, who, it seems, had been desirous to leave there behind them some marks of their passage
that way. We departed thence about four in the afternoon, and travell'd, that night, nine
leagues.
                  The 17, we came betimes in the morning, in sight of Saba, but in regard the Sun was not
yet up, we made a halt at some distance from the City, to give them time to come out and
receive us.
                  The Persians put this City at 85 degrees Longitude,The situation of Saba, and 35 Latitude; but I found it at 34
degrees, 56 minutes. It is seated in a spacious Plain, within sight of the Mountain of Elwende,
which may be discover'd thence, by reason of its height, which reaches in a manner to the
Clouds. The ruins of the City of Rhei are under the same parallel with that of Saba, from
which it is a good days journey distant, towards the East. The ground thereabouts is of a reddish
colour, and brings forth neither grass nor fruit.
                  The cause of that barrenness they attribute to the Malediction, which was pronounc'd against
it, upon the account of Omar Saad, who was one of the principal Military Commanders, in
the time of Hossein. This Omar, who had, at first, profess'd friendship to Hossein, prov'd the
only person who would serve Iesid Peser against him; upon this score, that Hossein, being
of the blood of Mahomet, and having acquir'd a great reputation of Sanctity, not one Captain
of Medina would take up Arms against him, but only this Omar, who engag'd in a war
against him, upon promise, that there should be bestow'd on him the City of Rhei, with the
Territories belonging thereto, which, long before, he had been very desirous of. But the death of
Hossein, who was kill'd in that VVar, brought upon the Countrey, the Curse,
which, according to their saying, is still visible there, in the colour and barrenness of
the ground.
                  The City of Saba is of no great bigness,Excellent fruits at Saba. though it be numbred among those, which make
a fair shew on the out-side, by reason of its Towers, and other publick structures. The Walls
of it are but of earth, and its houses in a manner all destroy'd: but it hath, in requital, very
fair Gardens, and rare and excellent Fruits, especially Pomegranates, and Almonds. Near the
City, at the foot of the Mountain, there grows abundance of Cotton and Rice, which are the
greatest Commodities they have to Trade in. We stay'd there only that one day, and departed
thence in the evening, travelling the night following six Leagues or better, so that, the 18.
by Sun-rising, we were got to a Caravansera, called Schach Ferabath. The heat was so excessive
that day, that though we were all in our Drawers, yet could we not possibly avoid the inconveniences
thereof.
                  We ordered our Tents to be pitch'd abroad,Excessive heats. so to have the advantage of the coolness, and
the wind, which came from the adjoyning Mountain; but, about noon, the Sun so heated the
Wind it self, that the hot blasts which come out of an Oven could not be hotter; insomuch
that we were forc'd to retire into the Caravansera, where the heat was somewhat more moderate.
Nay, the ground it self, which, in those parts, is only Sand and Heath, was so hot, that
a man could not go five or six steps, without burning his feet. About this time, both the Ambassadors
were very sick: but their indisposition giving them altternately a little ease, the
weaker of the two made use of the Litter, and the other rode on Horse-back.
                  The 19. we travell'd five Leagues,The City of Kom. and got in the morning before the City of Kom. The
Daruga receiv'd us within five or six hundred paces of the City, accompany'd by fifty Gentlemen
on Horse-back, and certain Tumblers, among whom there were some, who went upon
Stilts before the Ambassador Brugman, whose chance it was that day to be alone on Horse-back,
and shew'd a thousand tricks of activity, all the way to the Ambassadors Lodgings. As we
pass'd through the Market-place, we found a great number of Timbrels, Hawboyes and Fifes,
which made a kind of Musick after their way, and their Inhabitants had water'd the streets,
which being not pav'd no more than those of Caswin and several other Cities of Persia, the dust
had otherwise troubled and annoy'd us very much.
                  The Persians place this City at 85 degrees,Its situation. 40 minutes Longitude, and at 34 degrees, 45 minuts
Latitude; but after I had made a more exact observation thereof, I found on the 20. of
Iuly, precisely at noon, that the Sun was 74 degrees, 8 minutes above the Horizon, and that
the Declination, taken upon the same Meridian, was 18 degrees, 35 minutes; so that the elevation
of the Pole, could be but 34 degrees 17 minutes.
                  The City of Kom is very antient.Is Ptolomy's Guriana. Prolomy calls it Guriana, and heretofore it was of a great
extent, as may be seen by the ruins of its Walls, and other buildings, which are a great way
without its present compass.
                  It lies in a Plain, on the right hand of the Mountain of Elwend, which is discover'd at a great
distance by the whiteness of its Sand, and by the extraordinary height of its points. In this
Mountain, there rises, from two several Springs, a little River, which making but one Chanel
at the entrance of the City, runs through some part of it, and is one of the chiefest conveniences
belonging thereto: but about three years before our Travels that way, the little River,

over-flowing by reason of the Snow, which the precedent heat of the Spring had melted, broke
down and carried away above a thousand Houses.
                  There are in the Gardens,Its fruits. whereof there is a great number, as well within as without the
City, all sorts of excellent fruits; among others, a kind of Melons, which they call Scammame
much about the bigness of an Orenge. There are upon the rind spots of several colours,
and they have an admirable scent: but they are more lushious in taste than the other Melons,
which in sweetness exceed all those I ever cat any where else.
                  There are also some of these Melons at Ardebil,Melons. where, by reason of their scent, they commonly
carry them in their hands; but they told us, that they were brought from the Village
of Alaru, where there grows abundance of them. The learned Golius, Professor of the Oriental
Languages in the University of Leyden, gives a large account of them in his Arabick
Lexicon, pag. 1309. There is also in the same place a kind of Cowcumbers of extraordinary
largeness, being above two foot long, and as thick as a mans Arm, which they call Chunchiar
that is, crooked Cowcumbers, as having the form of a bended Arm.
                  These the Persians pickle with Vinegar, without any Salt, but the taste of them is not very
pleasant, especially to those that are not accustomed thereto. The ground about these parts is
very fit for Tillage, and produces all sorts of Grain, as also Cotton in abundance: but the
principal Trading of the Inhabitants consists in earthen Pots,Its Trafsick. and Sword-blades. Those blades
which are made in this City are accounted the best in the whole Country, and are sold sometimes
at twenty Crowns a piece. The Steel, of which they are made, comes from the City of
Niris, within four days journeys of Ispahan, where there are found in the Mountain of Demawend
very rich Mines of Iron and Steel. The Pots also made in the City of Kom, are very
much esteem'd, especially the Seans, or great Pitchars; as well by reason of the excellency of
the workmanship, as for this reason, that it is conceiv'd, they will keep water fresh and sweet,
even in the greatest heats of Summer.
                  The Inhabitants of this City are somewhat light-finger'd, and apt to find any thing lies in
their way.The Inhabitants inclin'd to thesi. We had hardly alighted, but our Pistols were taken away, and what was not
lock'd up immediately vanish'd. In this City some of our people began to be troubled with
bloody fluxes, occasion'd by their excessive eating of Melons and other sorts of fruits, and drinking
water after fruit, and in the greatest heats.
                  Iuly 21. we left Kom, an hour after Sun-set,They leave Kom. and travell'd that night five Leagues. The
next, the 22. We stay'd in a great Village, called Kasinabath, where all the Houses of
one whole street were built so as that they made altogether but one continued Vaul., or kind
of Cloister.
                  The 23. we got seven Leagues, to the Village of Sensen, where we found abundance of Provisions
and fruits, which the Mehemander had appointed to be brought nither from Karschan,
a place five Leagues distant thence. In this Village died one of our Interpreters for the Persian
Language, whose name was Gregory. He was by birth a Muscovite, but had been Circumcised;
upon which score, we left the body to those of his own Religion, to be buried after their
manner.
                  The 23. in the evening we departed thence, and the night following, we lost a Muscovian
servant, who dy'd of the bloody Flux by the way. We kept the Body to have it buried at
Katschan,Come to Katschan. with that of another Muscovian Servant, who died two hours after the former.
We got thither the 24. but so betimes in the morning, that we were forc'd to stay above two
hours, before the Daruga could come to meet us, in order to our reception. He was accompany'd
by fifty Gentlemen on Hors back, and had appointed to be led several excellent Horses cover'd
with Lynxes skins; nor was the ordinary Musick of the Countrey wanting. At the entrance
of the City, he shew'd us two Indian Oxen, very black, and of great height and bulk,
which had Bells about their necks, and Plumes of Feathers in their heads, and at their Cruppers.The Daruga's advancement
This Daruga had some time been a Foot-man to Schach-Sefi, when being very young,
they were forc'd to hide him from his Grand-father Schach-Abbas; and Schach-Sefi having no
money to live upon, sold the Foot-man for fifteen Tumains, which amount to seventy five
French Pistols. But coming afterwards to the Crown, he caus'd him immediately to be
redeem'd, and, with the quality of Sulthan, bestow'd on him the Government of
Katschan.
                  The Persians put this City of Katschan at 84 degrees longitude, and at thirty four distant
from the Line.The situation of Katschan. Its bigness After an exact Observation of three days, I found that it is distant from it
thirty three degrees and 51 minutes, that is, nine minutes less. The City is of a great length,
reaching from East to West, above half a German League. Its Walls and bastions are of a kind
of Potters day, and it lies in a great Plain, the ground of which is good enough for Tillage,
and there may be discover'd from it, on the right hand Mount Taurus, which the 'Porsians call
Elwend. As you come to the City, you pass through a place appointed for tilting and running
at the Ring, which hath on both sides several Pillars, and in the midst, a high Pole for
shooting at the wooden Parrat. On the left hand of that place or Carriere, you leave the

King's Garden, wherein there is one Summer-house, standing in the midst of it, and another
near it upon the High-way. We were told that the former hath a thousand Doors belonging to
it,A House with a 1000. Doors. comprehending in that number the Windows, through which they pass into the Galleries
and Balconies. It is to be observ'd withall, that there is no Door but hath its Counter-door, in
regard the Wall being above two foot thick, there is a Door on each side of it: so that the
number is not so great, as it seems to be at first. In this House, the King is Lodg'd, when he
comes to Katschan.
                  The City, is no doubt, one of the most populous and most eminent for Trading of any in
Persia, and the best Built of any we were yet come to, whether in regard of its private Houses,
or its Palaces and Caravansera's: but the Basar and Maidan, and the other publick structures,
which have all their Store-houses, Galleries, and Rooms for the Merchants, as well such as
live within the Kingdom, as Foreiners, are the noblest I met with in all my Travells into those
parts. There is, in this City, at all times, a great number of forein Merchants, and above
all, Indians, who are assigned there a particular place for their Habitation and Traffick; as
are also all the other Merchants. Tradesmen, especially such as make Silk-stuffs, and
Weavers of Gold and Silver Brocadoes, work in open places, where all the World may
see them.
                  The Valleys are very fruitfull in Wheat, Wine and Fruits, which grow in such abundance
there, that I find no difficulty to acknowledge, what Cartwright sayes of these parts, to wit,
that the poorest, and most indigent of the Inhabitants, have not only what is requisite for their
subsistence, but also somewhat of delicacy, and that what they most stand in need of is fresh
water. For there is not any to be had without digging very deep into the Earth, and what
there was so got we thought very distastfull to the Palat, and so corrupt, that had there not
been an extraordinary necessity, we should have been much troubled to swallow it. I must withall
confess, that I could not observe that excellent order and commendable policy, which Cartwright
sayes he had seen there in the Institution of Youth, nor that they are more carefull there
than in other places, to accustom it timely to pains-taking, so to avoid idleness, and the inconveniences
consequent thereto. True it is, that the great number of Children, which are ordinarily
to be found there in Families, which by reason of Polygamy are very numerous, obliges
the Parents to be the more carefull for their subsistence; but the Persians, for the most part are
so little inclin'd to pains-taking, that, commonly, you shall either see them walking in the
Maidan, or discoursing in the Shops, while they leave most of their work to be done by their
slaves. Which happens hence, that being themselves very temperate, and content with little,
and on the other side, Provisions being very cheap, they conceive they ought not to take
much pains for what is superfluous, and those things whereof there is no great necessity.
So that there are even in these parts idle Persons, and Beggers, as well as in other places.
                  What the same Cartwright sayes concerning the Scorpions,Venemous Creatures. and other venemous Creatures,
is very true. For of these, there are, about Katschan, more than at any other place of Persia,
and such as are so dangerous, that they have occasion'd that Malediction, Akrab-Kaschan be
destet senet: may the Scorpion of Kaschan pinch thee by the hand. We found some of them in
our Lodging, as black as cole, about the length and compass of a man's finger, and we were
told, that these were the most dangerous of any sort of them.
                  They are somewhat like our Crabs or Crevisses, save that their Bodies are shorter, they go
faster, and they have their tails alwayes sticking up. Whence it comes that the Inhabitants never
lay their Mattresses, or Beds, upon the ground, as they do in other places; but they set
them upon a kind of Trevets, or Frames, which they call Tzarpay. They affirm also, that
these Beasts have a certain respect for strangers, and that to prevent their stinging, they are only
to pronounce these words, Menkaribem, I am a stranger. But for my part, I am of opinion,
that strangers, who stand more in fear of them than the Inhabitants, are only the more
oblig'd to themselves for the care they have of their own safety; though I never could hear,
that those who are stung by them dye of it. For they have a present and easie remedy against
this kind of poison,A remedy against Scorpions. by applying a piece of Copper to the place affected; for which Cure they
ordinarily make use of that Money, which they call Pul, and thence it comes, that they carry
some of it alwayes about them; and having left that piece, for the space of 24. hours upon
the part stung, they take it off, and put on the Wound a Plaister made of Honey and Vineger.
                  It was my misfortune to be the only man of all our retinue that had occasion to make triall
how venemous this Creature is.The Author stung by a Scorpion. For lying down upon my Bed at Scamachie, in our return
from Ispahan, a Scorpion stung me in the throat, where it made immediately a swelling about
the length of my finger, which was attended with insupportable pain. As good fortune would
have it, our Physician, who lay in the same Chamber, immediately apply'd thereto the Oyl of
Scorpion, gave me some Treacle, and put me into a sweat: which deliver'd me from the greatest
of my pains at the end of three hours, but I had still some pain for the two dayes following,
but by intervals, and it was as if I had been prick'd with a Needle: nay indeed for many years

afterwards I have been troubled with the same pains at certain times, especially in Autumn,
much about the Sun's entrance into Scorpio.
                  There is also in these parts another sort of insect of a making much like a Spider,Another venemous insect. about two
inches in compass, and mark'd with several spots. This insect is commonly found lodg'd in stony
places, under a kind of Herb, which the Persians call Tremne, and the Turks, Iauchschan,
which is like Worm-wood, or Absynthium, but the leaves are much larger, and the smell much
stronger. The Persians call this insect Enkurek; and it is that animal which, in Latin, is called
Stellio, and kind of insect, which the Italians and Spaniards call Tarantola. This Creature,
instead of stinging or biting,Its venom, and the effect of it. lets fall its venom like a drop of water, which immediately causes
insufferable pain in the part where it fastens, and suddenly making its way to the Stomack,
sends up Vapour into the Head, and these put all the Members of the sick party into such a
profound sleep, that it is impossible to awake him, save by this only remedy, which is, to
crush one of these Creatures upon the wound;The remedy. out of which all the venom is by that means
drawn out.
                  But if there cannot any of the same Creature be found; there is another remedy may be
used. The sick person is laid upon his back, that he may swallow down as much Milk as may
be. Then he is put upon a thing made like a bier, which, by cords fasten'd to the four corners,
is hung up to a beam, and having turn'd the bier about, till the cords are all twisted, they let it
go of a sudden, that the cords coming to untwist by a violent Motion, may make his head turn,
and force out of his stomack all the Milk he had swallow'd. It comes from him all Greenish, as
is also the cruds which come forth at his yard, but with great violence and extreme pain. This
remedy does in some measure Cure the sick person; yet so as that it hinders not, but that, at
certain times, especially at the same season of the year, he must expect to feel much pain.
This Creature is to be found only in the Country, so that those who live in Cities fear it not,
there being none there,Sheep eat these insects. unless they are, through negligence, brought in the stubble, wherewith
they cover their Houses. But what's most to be admir'd in this animal, is, that the Sheep seek
after it, and feed on it.
                  The Inhabitants of Katchan relate, that Omar ben Alchitabi, the third Successor of Mahomet,The Fable of Schutza Adin.
being very desirous, one day, to go and see his Mill at Medina, the Miller, whose
name was Schutza Adin, intreated him to bless his Labour, and his Mill, by putting both his
hands under one of the Mill-stones which was rais'd up; which Omar having done, the Miller
let it fall and set the Mill a going, by which means having crush'd his hands to pieces, he afterwards
kill'd him. Whereupon going to Aly, who by that Death was to succeed in the Empire,
he desir'd a reward for the Murther he had committed. Aly gave him a Letter directed
to the Casi of Kaschan, ordering the Casi to give him his Daughter in Marriage. The Miller,
though well satisfy'd with the recompence, yet thought it too much to take so great a Journey
a-foot; so that Aly, to make a further acknowledgement of the service he had done him, lent
him his Horse Duldul, which carried him in one night from Medina to Kaschan, which places
are above two hundred Leagues distant, and immediately vansh'd. The Miller Married the
Casi's Daughter, but died soon after, and was buried without the City, at a place where now
there are several banks of Sand, which the story sayes, were brought thither by the
Wind, since the Millar's Death; lest the Friends and Kinred of Omar should take him up to be
burnt.Hassan Kaschi an Arbian Author. Molla Hassan Kaschi, who hath left this story in Writing, hath made a Proverb of
it, which, with several other spiritual adages, he hath inserted into the Kullusthan, where he
sayes, Men besamen, ohn schahemsia, Kickscheb duldulesch es Medine Ascabani bekaschan
aured: that is, I serve the King of Kings, whose (Horse) Duldul, in one night, carried the
Miller from Medina io Kaschan.Elmacini another Arabian Author. Tzurzei Elmakin, or George Elmacini, another Arabian
Historian sayes, lib. 1. ch. 3. of his History, that Omar was kill'd, as he was saying his Prayers,
by Abululu, the servant of Mukir, who hated him for his Tyranny.
                  The heats were indeed excessive at Kaschan;The Ambassadors leave Caschan. however, that the sick persons might not be put
too hard to it, we continued there for some dayes, and departed not thence till the 26. of Iuly???
as soon as the Moon was up, which was then at the full. That Night we travell'd six Leagues
and came the next morning to Caravansera, called Chotza Kassim: but in regard it was very
narrow, and withall very nasty, we lodg'd our selves in a Garden not far from it, in the shade
of abundance of Cypress Trees and Pomegranate-Trees, upon the side of a pleasant Rivulet,
which, making a gentle murmuring noise, contributed much to the repose, which, after the
precedent night's Travel, was but necessary to us. In the Evening, we continu'd our Journey,
and travell'd that night six Leagues or better, through Deserts and Barren grounds, and came,
the 28. about four in the morning, to a little City, called by the Inhabitants of the Country
Natens,Come to Natens. and by Contarini, in his Travels, Nethas. We took up our lodging in a Caravansera,
within the City, which is handsome enough, furnish'd with several Springs of fresh water, and
well stor'd with all sorts of Fruits. As you come into the City, you leave on the right hand
two very high and picked Mountains, one whereof hath on the top of it a great Tower, built
by Schach Abas, in memory of the advantage, which one of his Falcons had in that place

over an Eagle, which he set upon, overcame, and kill'd, after a very sharp engagement. All
of our Retinue being either sick or overcome with weariness, only Monsieur Mandelslo had the
curiosity to get up the said Mountain with his two servants, and to take a view of that structure.
He found it built of Brick, and that towards the foundation it was in an Octogonal form, being
about eight paces Diameter; but that as it went higher and higher, it by degrees lost that form
and bigness, and that above, near the top, it had so many windows, that the light came in of
all sides. The greatest Miracle of all is, how they could carry so many materials up to so high
a place, to get to which, that Gentleman had spent above three hours, and at least as much to
get down again, with great pains and hazard.
                  The 29. we got four Leagues further,Contine their journey. passing over a great Mountain, and lodg'd in a Caravansera,
called Dombi, whither some of the Inhabitants of Ispahan came to visit us, as they said,
from the Chancellor. There came thither also certain Dutch Merchants, cloath'd in Persian habits;
but they made no discovery of themselves.
                  The night between the last of Iuly and the first of August,AUG. we travell'd four leagues further,
and came the next day to a Village called Kuk. We were lodg'd in the house of the
Kaucha, or Judge of the place, where we continu'd all that day, and the night following.
                  August 2. we departed thence two hours before day, the Moon shining bright, and got
but two leagues further, to one of the Kings houses, where we took up our quarters in a very
fair Garden, which was our last nights Lodging in our passage to the City of Ispahan. For,
very betimes the next morning being the third of August, horses were sent us, to make our
entrance into the Metropolis of the Kingdom. Within a quarter of a League of the City, we
found one of the principal Officers of the Court, named Isachan-beg, in the head of 200 horse,
and some paces thence, two great Armenian Lords, named Sefaras-beg, and Elias-beg, who
conducted the Ambassadors to their Lodgings The dust, which the horse, and the people who
came to meet us, had rais'd, was so thick, that we were got to the Gates, before we imagin'd
we could have seen the City. Not only the streets and windows were full of people, who
out of curiosity were come to see our entrance into the City, but also the tops of the houses
were covered with them.
                  We were conducted through several streets,Are lodg'd among the Armenians. through the Maidan, and before the Kings Palace,
to that part of the Suburbs which is called Tzulifa, where we were lodg'd in the Quarter
of the chiefest of the Armenian Merchants, who are Christians, and have their habitations
there. We had hardly alighted, ere there were brought us from the King's Kitchin the ordinary
Presents of Provisions, for our welcome thither. They laid upon the floor of the Ambassadors
Room a fine silk Cloath, on which were set one and thirty Dishes of Silver, fill'd
with several sorts of Conserves, dry and liquid, and raw fruits, as Melons, Citrons, Quinces,
Pears, and some others, not known in Europe. Some time after, that Cloath was taken away,
that another might be laid in the room of it; and upon this was set Rice of all sorts of colours,
and all sorts of Meat, boyl'd and roasted, to wit, Mutton, tame Fowl, Fish, Eggs, and Pyes, in
above fifty Dishes of the same metal, besides the Sallet-dishes, great Porrenges, and other
lesser Vessels.Are visited by the Dutch Factor. Presently after Dinner, the Commissary or Factor for the Dutch Commerce,
whose name was Nicholas Iacobs Overschle, who was afterwards Governour of Zeilan, for
the East-India Company, came to visit the Ambassadors, who being then looking upon the
unlading of the Baggage (though that should have been the employment of their Steward or
some other Officer) would have wav'd the visit upon that pretence. But the Dutchman would
not be put off his visit, wherein he ingenuously acknowledg'd, that he had received Orders
from his Superiours to oppose our Negotiation; but that nevertheless, as to what concern'd
the Ambassadors themselves, he should do them all the civilities they could expect from
him. He seem'd desirous to drink, and we had the Complyance to give him his load ere he
went away.
                  The joy we conceiv'd at our having,A quarre. with the Indian Ambassadors Domesticks. at last, arriv'd to a place, where we hoped to put a
period to our Negotiation, was soon disturbed by a most unhappy accident, and the Divertisements
intended us, were within a few days after our coming thither, changed into a bloudy
Contestation with the Indians, occasion'd by the insolence of one of the Domesticks belonging
to the Mogul's Ambassador, who was Lodg'd not far from our Quarters, with a Retinue of
three hundred persons, most of them Vsbeques. One of their Domesticks standing by, and
looking on our people unloading and putting up the Baggage, our Mehemanders servant, named
Willichan, said to him jesting, that it would speak more good nature in him, to come and
help them, than to stand as he did with his Arms a-cross; whereto the other making answer
somewhat too snappishly, as he conceiv'd, the Persian struck him over the pate with his Cane.
The Indian incens'd at the affront, ran to some of his Camerades, who were lying hard by
under the shade of a Tree, and made his complaints to them of the injury he had receiv'd;
upon which they all got up, and fell upon Wellichan, whom they wounded in the head
with stones.
                  
                     
Our Domesticks perceiving this tumult, brought our Steward notice of it, who taking along
with him five or six Soldiers, and some others of our servants, charg'd the Indians (whole
number was augmented to hear thirty) so home, that they mortally wounded one, and pursu'd
the rest to their Quarters: but what most troubled the Indians, was, that, in this engagement,
they had lost a Sword and a Poniard, whereto a little Purse was faste'd, in which
there was some small money, which our People brought home as a sign of their Victory. The
Industhans, at that time, thought it enough to threaten how highly they should resent that affront,
and that they should take occasion to revenge their Camerade. Nor indeed were they
unmindful of their threats; for the Ambassadors having resolv'd to change their Lodgings, by
reason of the great inconvenience it was to them, that their Domesticks were scatter'd up and
down the Suburbs, and quarter'd at a great distance from them, and having appointed the seventh
of August for their removal, the Indians took their advantage of that occasion, to be
satisfy'd for the affront they imagin'd they had received.
                  We had sent before a Lacquey belonging to our Steward, and some of our Seamen with part
of the Baggage, to be, by them, conducted to the Lodgings we had taken up, which were
within the City, a quarter of a League or better distant from the former. Certain Indians
who were lying under Tents to keep their Master's Horses, which were then feeding between
the City and Suburbs, knew him, as having seen him in the former engagement, set upon
him, and, though he gallantly defended himself with his Sword and Pistol, at last kill'd him
with their Arrows; which done, they cut off his head, toss'd it up and down in the Air, and
bound his body to his Horse-tayl; which dragg'd it to a certain place, where the Dogs devour'd
it. The news brought us of this Murther was enough to assure us, that the Industhans would
not think that revenge enough, but that they were resolv'd to set upon us with all their forces.
Whereupon the Ambassadors sent out Orders, that all of their Retinue should stand upon their
Guard, and come with all expedition to their Lodgings. But, before this Order could be put
in Execution, the Indians had already possess'd themselves of all the Avenues of their Quarters,
which they had in a manner block'd up: in so much that none could get in, without running
the hazard of being kill'd. However, reflecting on the imminent and inevitable danger it was to
lie scatter'd up and down in several quarters, most of the Domesticks thought it their safest
course, though with some danger, to make their way to the House where the Ambassadors
were, which was in the corner of a narrow street. Most of them escap'd the fury of the Indians,
but some were mortally wounded, and I my self came very near it, for I was no sooner
got within the door, but an Arrow came grazing through my hair, and was shot into one of
the Posts. All their Arrows were made of Canes, having a sharp and cutting piece of Iron at
the end, and so light, that the least strength sent them away with incredible swiftness, and
they pierc'd where they lighted, as dangerously as a Bullet from a Fire-lock. Which is the
more to be observ'd, in opposition to that passage of Quintus Curtius, where he sayes in the
eighth book of his History, Binum cubitorum sunt sagittae (Indis) quas emittunt majore nisu
quam effectu; quippe telum, cujus in levitate vis omnis est, inhabili pondere oneratur. But besides
these Arms, they had also Muskets, and Arquebuses, according to the Persian way, which
are of a very small bore, wherewith they shot very exactly.
                  Our Lieutenants did all that could be expected from persons of courage and conduct, setting
their Soldiers in Order at the Door of the Ambassadors Lodgings, and causing several Volleys
of Musket-shot to be discharg'd at the Indians. But the Indians made their advantage of a Wall,
which serv'd them for a Parapet; and they had made several holes in it, that they might shoot
with less danger to themselves, and more annoyance to us. On the contrary, our people, instead
of following their example (whom some would have accounted Barbarians, but who
will not be found such) and making their advantage of the Chests, and the Baggage, which
were in the street, had no other Parapet, than their own Breasts, which were expos'd to all
their Volleys. One of our Canoneers, as he was going to level a small Piece at the Indians,
was kill'd.
                  Sergeant Morrhoy, a Scotchman, seeing the Canoneer fall at his feet, took up his Musket,
and set himself in a posture of revenging his Camerades death. He was so fortunate as to kill
five or six Indians, but at last an Arrow takes him just in the breast, which, not at all troubled
at, he pluck'd it out, and, having charg'd his Musket once more, kill'd another man, and then
fell down dead upon the place,
                  The Armenians living thereabouts, who were Spectators of this engagement, could help
us no otherwise than with their tears, whereby they express'd the afliction it was to them to
see the death of so many poor Christians. At last, the number of the Indians increasing still,
the Muskets play'd so fast, that the Ambassadors were forc'd to command their people to come
into the house, and, remaining in the Court, to keep the Indians from getting into the house.
But they making their advantage of our retreat, fell upon the Baggage, and ransack'd it, and
not content with that, they forc'd their way into the next house to us, and because the Master
of it would have kept them from coming in, they cut off one of his hands, and afterwards kill'd

him. By which means getting up to the top of it, they could look into our Court, and so forc'd
our people to abandon it. Some of ours got up to the top of our house, and making their advantage
of the Parapet, no Indian appear'd but they shot at him, and no shot but did execution.
M. Mandcislo,The Indian Leader kill'd. who had an excellent faculty in the handling of Fire-arms, kill'd the Leader of
the Indian party with a Pistol-shot. His death made them all fury, insomuch that they got out
of the place where they were, with a design to force our Gates: which resolution of theirs oblig'd
the Ambassadors to think of some retreat, and to break down the Walls of the adjoyning
houses, where the Armenians, who lived in them, joyfully receiv'd us, and brought us Ladders
to get down into a fair Garden. We all got down into it, but the pleasaniness of the
place, took us no more than a delicious Dish of Meat would do a Malefactor, that were going
to his execution, in regard we expected death there every moment.
                  While we were thus out of all hope of escape,The King inter pses his Authority. one of the : shals of the Court came to us
from the King, to bring us news of a Peace. He was come some times before, with the same
orders, but he heat  engagement had hindred us, as well as the Indians from hearing
what message he brought: for, the Inhabitants of Ispahn, perceiving the noise increased, and
fearing a greater disorder, which might be of dangerous consequence among a people who had
never seen any thing of that nature, the King sent thither a hundred Souldiers well arm'd, in
the Head of a good number of the Inhabitants, but as soon as the Indians perceiv'd that Body
coming towards them, they dispers'd themselves. We were told, that the King hearing of
the Murther, which was the Prologue to all this Tragedy, and withall that the Indian Ambassador
had Coniv'd thereat, had Commanded his Head to be brought him; but that the Chancellor
had moderated that sally of his Passion, by representing to him, that both the Ambassadors
were Strangers, and his Guests, and that it belong'd to their Masters, and not to him, to
punish them.
                  This peace brought us also the liberty to go into the Streets, where we found our Chests
broke open, and all the Baggage plunder'd, unless it were certain Sawcidges, Neats-Tongues,
and Gammons of Bacon, which the Indians, as being Mahumetanes, had thrown by. Our loss
upon this occasion amounted to above four thousand-Crowns. The King demanded a particular
of it, and would have defray'd us; but that kindness of his had not its effect, for reasons but
too well known to all the Retinue.
                  In the fore-said engagement, which lasted above four hours, we lost five men, and had ten
wounded. The Indians, according to the Informations we receiv'd from the Persians, lost
therein about four and twenty men,The Indian Ambassador dismiss'd. and had many more hurt: but the Indian Ambassador had,
some few dayes after, orders sent him to be gone. This was the most unhappy accident we me
with in all our Travells: for, after we had escap'd all the dangers, which we might well have
fallen in  the way, and the injuries might have been done us by the most Cruel and Barbarous
people, through whose Territories we pass'd, this sad accident happen'd to us in the
chief City of the Kingdome, where we thought to find rest after all the hardships we had endured.
                  As to this Indian Ambassador, he was a Myrsa, or Indian Prince, and had been sent to the
Court of Persia, by Choramscha, King of the Indies, whom they call the Great Mogul, and not,
as he is commonly called, Mogor. He had a very noble Retinue, and was ordinarily carried in
a Litter, according to the Indian making, more fit to lye down in, than to sit, which was carried
by several Slaves, it being hang'd at a great Iron-barr made crooked in the middle. The
King of Persia, who knew on what occasion he was sent Ambassador to him, made him stay
three whole years,His aboad at Ispahan before he gave him audience, ordering him in the mean time to be magnificently
treated, insomuch that some few dayes before our arrival, the King had sent him, besides
many before, a Present of three thousand Tumains, which amount to fifty thousand Crowns;
the Ambassador himself, it seems, defraying the expence of his House-keeping.
                  The Ambassador, on the othe other side, demean'd himself suitably to this magnificence;
for he spent the three first dayes after his audience in bestowing the Presents he had brought
along with him.His presents. Those he made the first day, were in the name of the Great Mogul: those
made the second, in the name of the Prince his Son; what he did, the third, was upon his own
accompt. We were credibly inform'd, that the Presents made by him amounted to above a
hundred thousand Crowns.The occason of the Embassy??? His business was, to intreat the King of Persia, to put into his
hands the Myrsa Polagi, Prince of the Blood, and Nephew to the Mogul, who had been forc'd
to retire into Persia to save his Life, which he was in danger to lose, as he had done his Kingdome.
The King excus'd himself, and generously made answer, that it were a breach of the
Laws of Hospitality, to deliver up a Prince, who, out of an assurance of his friendship, had
taken refuge in his Kingdome; that he was oblig'd in honour to treat him as a Friend,
and a Guest, and to give him entertainment as long as he should think fit to stay in his
Countrey.
                  This was all the Answer the Ambassador could get,He departs??? in relation to the Embassy; but that he
might be assur'd, they had no great kindness for himself in particular, secret orders were sent

to Hassan-Chan Governour of Herath, which is the most considerable of any place towards the
Frontiers of the Indies, that he should stop, in their passage, four or five hundred Horses, which
the Ambassador had bought, and sent away by small parties, that, at his coming??? he might
find them ready upon the Frontiers: for the Indian Horses are small and ill-shap'd, whence it
comes, that the Indians are so desirous to have some of the Persian breed. The Ambassador
storm'd, alleg'd his quality, and urg'd it as an affront done his Master in his person, and, that
the King of Persia, who knew he had bought them, and had permitted him to do so, was, no
doubt, willing he should take them along with him. But Hassan-Chan made answer, that he
was King in his own Province, that if he did ought prejudicial to the King's service, his Life
should answer for it, and that he would not suffer any Horses to go out of the Country, it being
to be fear'd they might afterwards be brought to serve in the Warrs against his Majesty, to
whom he was to give a strict accompt of all his actions. So that the Ambassador was forc'd to
leave the Horses behind him, and to sell them at such rates as the Persians would give him for
them. As for the Indians in general, they are good Natur'd, Civil, Friendly, and their Conversation
not unpleasant, provided they be not injur'd; but so apt to resent any thing of affront,
that they are never satisfy'd without their Blood, by whom they are offended, We know it
otherwise than by hear-say.
                  The next day after this unhappy engagement, to wit, the 8. of August, we chang'd our
Lodgings, and, to prevent any disorder that might happen, especially upon the accompt of the
Indians, the King caus'd prohibitions to be made, that not only any of the Ambassadors Retinue,
but also, of the other Indians, nay even the Merchants of that Nation, whereof there are
above twelve thousand in Ispahan, should, upon pain of Death, be seen in the streets, till we
were gotten within the City. And that we might be the more secure, we found attending near
our Lodgings, some of the Guard, who went along with us to our new Quarters, which we
were permitted to fortifie at the weakest places, against any attempt might be made by the Indians,
who might easily and with advantage have assaulted us in our Quarters, by reason it was
of a vast extent, they having openly threatned to do it.
                  The Structure comprehended four great Courts,The Ambassadors change their quarters. through two whereof there ran a Rivulet
twenty five foot in breadth, planted on both sides with that delightfull Tree called Tzinnar,
which made two very pleasant walks. The same Rivulet ran through some of the Halls and
Galleries, and went under ground, under the main part of the Lodging; which was design'd
for the appartment of the Ambassadors. There was in the midst of it, and below, a spacious
Hall, built eight square, with a fair Fountain, and at every side of the Octagone a Door, which
led into several Chambers. The first Story had the same appartments, but this over and above,
that the Windows serv'd for Doors, some whereof led into Galleries and Balconies that look'd
into the Garden, some towards the Hall; so that a man might, out of any Chamber, see
what was done in the Hall. In the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, the Basin whereof
was of Freestone.
                  During our aboad at Ispahan, we were supply'd with all things upon the King's accompt, being
allow'd,The King treats them still. every day, sixteen Sheep, a hundred of all sorts of tame Fowl, two hundred
Eggs, and a hundred Batmans of Wine, with Fruit and spice in such abundance, that we might
have made very good Cheer, had it not been for their ill management thereof, who had the
disposal of them, and who squander'd away the Provisions, not only by Connivence, but also
by the express order of one of the Ambassadors, I mean him of Hamborough, who sent them to
them Armenians, and, many times, to common prostitutes. Whence it came, that some times
our people made but one meal a day, nay some dayes, the servants and others had no cloath
laid at all.
                  Aug. 10. the Ambassadors sent some of the Retinue to Alexis Savinouits, Ambassador from
the Duke of Muscovy, to treat with him concerning their common affairs; and in regard the
Persians were not well pleas'd to see us in our own Cloaths, we put our selves into the Muscovian
fashion,They go into Muscovian habits as coming somewhat nearer their mode. About this time, dyed some of our people,
who had been Wounded, in the Engagement with the Indians, and, among others, one
of our Guard, who had been hurt in the knee, with a poisoned Arrow. Our Harbinger died also
the same day, but it was of a Bloody-flux, which took him after he had been sufficiently shaken
by a Tertian Ague, and dispatch'd him in a few dayes. VVe buried them both in the Churchyard
of the Armenians, in that part of the Suburbs, which is called Tzulfa.
                  August the 16. the Ambassadors had their first audience of the King, who sent them word,
that they should also have the honour to dine with him,Their first audience. and to that end, sent them forty gallant
Horses out of his own Stables, the Saddles and Harnesses whereof were adorn'd with great
plates of Gold.
                  The Ambassadors made use only of two,The Presents made in the Prince's name. and also ordered the Gentlemen and the principal
Officers to ride on Horse-back, but the rest went a-foot, in the following order.
                  First, march'd three men or Horse-back, two whereof were in compleat arms, having

Flowers, and other Workmanship of Gold. The third was arm'd only as a Horse-man, with
Back, Breast, and Pot, yet all very rich.
                  After him march'd forty Persons, having every one a Case of Pistols, the best that
could be had in the Low Countries, with their Holsters, the laps whereof were Embroider'd.
                  Next, four men, carrying two rich Cymitars, the sheaths whereof were of yellow Amber,
garnish'd with Gold, in very rich Cases.
                  Next, two men, with Walking staves, done about with Amber, which the Persians esteem
above Gold, in very rich Cases.
                  Four men, carrying so many great Candlesticks of Amber.
                  Two others, carrying a Cabinet of white and yellow Amber.
                  Four others, carrying a Cabinet of Ebony, garnish'd with Silver, having within it, in Golden
Boxes, several Druggs, Essences and Magisteries, and the coverings thereof beset with fine
stones, which signify'd what Magistery there was in every Box.
                  And whereas it is the custom of the Country,The Ambassadors Presents. that Ambassadors are oblig'd to make some
Presents from themselves, and upon their own accompt, the Ambassador Crusius sent in an Arquebuss,
the stock whereof was of Ebony, which cock'd it self by letting down the Cock; A
vessel of Rock Chrystal, done about with Gold, and beset with Rubies and Turqueses; a Cabinet
of Amber, and a small striking Clock. The Ambassador Brugman presented the King
with a gilt brass Candlestick, that had thirty branches, having a striking Watch within the body
of it; a pair of gilt Pistols, in very rich Holsters; a very fair Hour-glass; a Watch in a
Topaze case; a Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies; and, a Writing, whereby were presented
the two pieces of Canon, which we had left at Ardebil.
                  Every one had his place assign'd him,The Persians observe no Order in their Ceremonies. to the end that all things might be presented to the
King with the observance of some Order; but the Persians never observe it in any Ceremony:
insomuch, that they were no sooner got into the street, but they were all in disorder, and
march'd with such onfusion, that the Ambassadors Retinue could not make the Procession they
expected.
                  First, there should have march'd three Sergeants with Halberds, in the Head of fifteen Musketiers.
After them the Mashal, or Steward, alone, in the Head of the Gentlemen, who march'd
three a breast. Then, three Trumpeters, with silver Trumpets, and after them march'd the
Guards, four a-breast, immediately before the Ambassadors, who had on both sides eight
Halberteers, and behind them the two Interpreters. The eight Pages follow'd, on horse-back,
in very rich Liveries, and after them the rest of our people, marching three a-breast, and eight
deep.
                  The Ambassadors being come in this order, attended by a great number of Kisibachs, and
Persian Gentlemen on Horse-back, whom the King had sent to them, through the Maidan,
to the Gates of the Palace-Royal, they were there received by Iesaul Senhobet, who is as it
were the Introductor,The reception of the Ambassadors. or Master of the Ceremonies. He commanded those who carried the Presents
to make way for the Ambassadors, whom he conducted into a Hall, where the Divanbeki,
or Judges, are wont to meet, for the Administration of Justice, and intreated them to rest
themselves, till he had acquainted the King with their arrival. About half an hour after, several
great Lords came to give the Ambassadors notice, that the King expected them. We
were brought through a spacious Court, which was of greater length than breadth, and in
which there was on both sides, about six paces distance from one Wall, another lower Wall,
built close to a row of Tzinnar-Trees; and all along that lower Wall, stood the Musketiers,
and the other Guards, in a file on both sides.
                  The Guards were distinguish'd from the Musketiers, by the Coiffure they wore about their
heads, which was pointed, and set out with plumes of Feathers, of several Colours. They
call this kind of Courts or Walks, Cheywan, and they afford a very delightful prospect. At
the end of this Court, there was a great Hall, having light coming in of all sides, which was
the place design'd for our audience.The Hall for audience. It is called Diwan Chane, as being the place, where the
King administers Justice in Person: there being a great difference between the Custom of Persia,
and that of Muscovy; where the Great Duke hath a particular Hall, wherein he gives audience
to Ambassadors; whereas the King of Persia does it in those places where he accidentally is,
either about other business, or for his Divertisement. Near the said Hall, and under those
Trees, between the two Walls, there were to be seen fifty excellent Horses, with their covering-Cloaths
of Brocado, or Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and among those some Arabian
Horses, ready to be back'd, with their Saddles and Harness, cover'd all over with
plates of Gold, and beset with abundance of precious stones. All the Horses stood in the open
Air, fasten'd by one of the hinder feet to a stake struck in the ground, and they were most of
them of an Isabella Colour, about the Belly and Legs. There stood hard by Pails of Vermilion
Gilt,Silver Pails to water horses. for the watering of them. Not far thence, there were two great Cisterns four foot
square, for the cooling of Wine.
                  
                     
This Hall was rais'd three steps from the ground, and was eight fathom broad, and twelve
in length. There was at the entrance into it a Partition, like an Alcove, with Curtains drawn
before it, of red Cotton, which were taken up and let down with silk strings. When they were
drawn up, they rested upon the Chapters of certain wooden Pillars, made Cylinder-wise, Embellish'd
with Branch-work, Painted, and Gilt, as were also the Walls. On the left hand, as
you came in, there were some pieces of Painting, done in Europe, and representing certain Histories.
The floor was cover'd all over with Tapistry, whereof the ground-work was of Gold
and Silver, and in the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, and in the Basin of it abundance
of Flowers, Citrons, Orenges, Apples, and other Fruits, which swom upon the water. About
the sides of the Basin, there were a great number of Gold and Silver Flaggons, and Bottles,
which either had Garlands or Flowers about them, or posies in their Mouths.
                  The King sate upon the ground,The King's age. having a satin Cushion under him, behind the Fountain,
with his back to the VVall. He was about seven and twenty years of Age, handsome Bodied,
having a gracefull Aspect, and of a clear and smooth Complexion, somewhat Hawk-Nos'd, as
most of the Persians are, and he had a little black Hair upon the upper lip. There was nothing
extraordinary in his Habit, save that his Cloaths were of Brocadoe, and that, at his Coiffure,
there was a Plume of Heron-Feathers, fasten'd with a bracelet of Diamonds. He had also upon
his Kurdi, that is, a kind of Coat without Sleeves, which the Persians wear upon their Garments,
two Sable Skins hanging at the Neck: but for ought we saw afterwards, other Persian
Lords wore the like. The Cymitar he had by his side glitter'd with Gold and Precious Stones;
and behind him, upon the ground, there lay a Bow and Arrows.
                  On his right hand there stood twenty Pages, who were, most of them, as we were told,
the sons of Chans, and Sulthans, Governours of Provinces, among whom there were some
Eunuchs.
                  They were all very handsome, as to their Persons, but it seems, they had made choice of the
handsomest among them, to hold the Fan, wherewith he incessantly gave the King air. These
Fanns are made of a certain Sea-Creature, which they call Maherikutas, and it is like a Horsetail.
Near the Pages stood the Meheter, or Groom of the Chamber, who hath the oversight
of them. Before the King stood Elschick agasi baschi, or the Lord Chamberlain of the
Houshold, having in his hand a Staff cover'd all over with Gold, as was also the great Button
or Apple at the top of it. VVithin four paces of the King, and on his left hand, sat the Chancellor
whom they call Ethemad Dowlet, and about him, the Chans, and great Lords of the
Privy Counsell. At the entrance of the Hall, on the left hand, sat the Ambassadors of an Arabian
Prince, who had been sent to desire the King's Protection against the Turk; and the
Poslanick of Muscovy, Alexei Savinouits; and somewhat lower were placed the King's
Musick.
                  The Ambassadors were receiv'd at the entrance of the Hall,The Ambassadors broght in to audience by the Prince Tzani-Chan, Kurtzi
Baschi, of whom we spoke before, and by Aliculi-bek??? Divanbeki, who took them under the
Arms, one after the other, and brought them to the King. These Conductors, as they led the
Ambassadors along, laid such fast hold on their hands, that they had not the use of them themselves.
                  This Ceremony is very necessary, and must now be look'd on as a particular honour done
the Ambassadors, though it be said, and that very probably, that with the same labour, they
secure the Prince's Life, against the attempts there might be made against it. But I would not
have any to credit what some affirm, to wit, that this Ceremony hath not been observ'd in Persia
but since the Reign of Schach-Abas, and that it was occasion'd by the design which some Turkish
Ambassadors had to kill him. For this custom is also observ'd in the Grand Seignor's Court,
as well as in Persia; nay it is my opinion, that it is for the same reason, that the King does not
give his Hand, but his Knee to strangers to kiss, to his own Subjects thinking it enough to present
his foot.
                  The Ambassadors, as they came near the King, made a low Reverence, which he civilly answered
with a little Inclination of the Head, and a smiling and obliging Countenance. They
were immediately led away, and intreated to sit down, on low Seats, which had been plac'd
near the Lords of the Councel. The same honour was done to fifteen of the Retinue, but they
were forc'd to sit down a little more on the left hand, and upon the ground. The ground. The Pages, and
the rest of the Retinue, were conducted into the Court, where they were seated, near thirteen
VVomen-Dancers, who were very handsome VVomen, and very richly Cloath'd, and sate upon
Tapistry, whereof the ground-work was Gold and Silver.
                  Some of our people were perswaded they were the ordinary Dancing-women belonging to
the Court, and gave that accompt of them in the Relations they have made of their Travells;
but it is certain, they were some of the handsomest Curtezans of the City, who, besides the
Tribute they yearly pay the King, are oblig'd to come to Court, to divert the Prince, when
ever he sends for them. VVe were told, that a man might have had his choice of them for a
Tumain.
                  
                     
The Ambassadors having rested themselves a little, the King sent the Lord Chamberlain to
them, to know the Prince's name, by whom they were sent, and the occasion of their Embassy.
Which message oblig'd them to rise up, and to go near the King, with their Interpreter, to deliver
their Credentials, which they accompany'd with a Complement, which was so much the
shorter, in regard the Persians, who are no Lovers of long Speeches, would have those that
approach their King to do it with respect, and to express that respect by a Discourse of few
words. The Chancellor receiv'd the Credentials, and after the Ambassadors were seated again,
the Wakaenuis, or Secretary of the Chamber, came and told them, that the Schach would order
their Credential letters to be Translated; that as soon as it were done, his Majesty would
give them a second audience, for their affairs, and that in the mean time, he desir'd them to
Divert themselves as much as might be. This done, the Presents were brought in, which were
carried, close by the King, into an appartment design'd for the Treasury, on one side of the
Hall, at the entrance of the Palace.
                  While the Presents were carried in, the Cloath was laid, that is, all the floor of the Hall
was cover'd with one piece of Cotton Cloath, on which were set all sorts of Fruits and Conserves,
all in great Basins of Gold,Gold Plate. whereof there was so great a number, that there was hardly
place left for three hundred great Flaggons of the same Metal, which were dispers'd here and
there, only for Ostentation sake: so that which way soever a man look'd, there was nothing
to be sent but Gold. All the Plate was plain and smooth, save only the Flaggon and Cup out
of which the King himself drunk, which two pieces the Persians call Surhahi, and Piali, which
were beset with Rubies and Turqueses. With these conserves, we had excellent Schiras-wine,Schiras-wine.
and they gave us the Divertisement of a fellow that shew'd tricks of Legerdemain, who did beyond
any thing I ever saw of that kind before. About an hour after, the Conserves were taken
away, that the Meat might be brought in??? The floor was laid with another Cloath; which
was of a Gold Brocado, and there came in ten men loaden with Meat in great Vessels of Gold,
made like the Milk-pails in France, which some carried upon their Heads, some upon a kind of
Barrows, which were also cover'd with plates of Gold.
                  The Suffretzi,The Carver. that is, the Carver, having plac'd the Meat, sate down in the midst of the
Table, or floor of the Hall, took the Meat out of those Vessels, and dispos'd it into Dishes, and
sent them, first to the King, then to the Ambassadors, and afterwards to the Lords, and the
rest of the Company. They understand not what it is to entertain with several Courses, but set
down all upon the Table at once, and think they treat their Guests very well. All the Dishes
were fill'd with Rice of all sorts of Colours, and the Carver put the Meat upon the Rice, to wit,
Mutton, boyl'd and roasted, tame and wild Fowl, Omelets, Pies, Spinage, Sow-cruds, &c.
insomuch, that many times, there was five or six sorts of Meat in the same Dish. This is done
by design,Their manner of sitting at meat. and for their own convenience; in regard, that, not sitting at a Table opposite one
to another, but all of a side, as the Monks do, and consequently one man being not able to
reach to several Dishes, they are served several sorts of Meat in the same Dish.
                  But as we imitated the Monks in our manner of sitting,Silence at
meats. so were we as silent as they are at
Meals: for there was not a word spoken all the time we were at Meat; unless it were that the
King himself whisper'd twice or thrice to the Chancellor. But there was not that silence observ'd
at two or three other Entertainments we had at the Court afterwards: for then, the King
was pleas'd to fall into some discourse with the Ambassadors, concerning the affairs of Europe,
and particularly concerning the Warrs of Germany.
                  We had also,Musick. while we were at Dinner, the Divertisement of their Musick, and the Activity
of those Curtezans. The Musick consisted of Lutes, Violins, Flageolets, Hawboies, and Timbrels,
which he who play'd upon the Timbrel, accompany'd with a wretched inharmonious
Voice, which disorder'd the little Consort there was in their pretended Consort. The Dancing
of the Women was more regular, and though it was not consonant to the Musick, nor the way
of Dancing among the Europaeans, yet was it not undelightfull, but had its cadences and exactness
as well as ours.
                  While we were at Dinner, there lay hid, in a Door which was cover'd by the Hangings, over
against the place where the Ambassadors sat, a Persian, who understood the Portuguez and
Italian, to observe their Demeanour, as also what discourse they might have with their Interter,
that he might give an accompt of what they said concerning the fashions and manners of
that Court. The relation he gave in to the King of what the Ambassador Brugman had said of
the Pictures, and the Entertainments, and the manner of Life of the Persians, prov'd to his
disadvantage and Prejudice. Our Interpreter was a Portuguez, an Augustine Frier, about forty
years of age. His name was Father Ioseph, of the Rosary, a good natur'd man, obliging, and
complaisant, and a person that understood himself very well; inasmuch, as, having liv'd four
and twenty years in Persia, he was excellently well skill'd in the Language, and throughly
acquainted with the humour and customs of that Nation. In his discourse with the Ambassador
Crusius, he made use of the Latin Tongue, and spoke Portuguez to the Ambassador
Brugman.
                  
                     
They sat at Dinner about an hour and a half, and then the Cloath being taken away, there
was warm water brought to wash their hands. Which done, the Lord Chamberlain cry'd aloud,
Suffre Hakine, Scahe douletine, Kasiler Kuwetine, alla dielum; that is, Make us thankful
for this repast, prosper the King's affairs, give his Soldiers and Servants courage; this we
pray thee, O God: whereto all the rest answer their Alla, Alla. Grace being thus said, they
rose up, and went out of the room one after another, without speaking a word, according to
the custom of the Country. Our Mehemander came also to tell us that we might withdraw
when we pleas'd; as we immediately did, making a low Reverence to the King.
                  After this first audience, we were permitted to receive the Visits of all other Nations, who
have any Commerce at Ispahan, as the French, Spaniards, Italians, English and Dutch. They
came often to see us, and contributed much to our Divertisement, during the aboad we made
in that City, The English were the first that gave us a Visit. Their Factor, whose name was
Francis Honywood, came to our Quarters the 18 of August, accompany'd by a considerable
number of Merchants, who, to express the affection they bore us, had all put themselves into
the German fashion, though otherwise they went according to the mode of their own Country.
The Factor was an excellent good natur'd man, and excessively civil. He immediately made proffers
of his service to us, and afterwards made them good upon all occasions, and kept us company
most part of that day.
                  The 22. The King sent the Ambassadors a Present of Fruits, as Melons, Apples, Pears,
Grapes, Quinces; and others, and, along with it, thirty great Flaggos of most excellent
Schiras-Wine.
                  The 24. the Ambassadors had their first private audience,The first private Audience. concerning their Negotiation, at
which was the King himself in Person, attended by the Chancellor, and a great number of the
Lords of the Councel. This conference was not had in the Divan-Chane, but in another apartment,
into which we were brought, through a spacious Gallery, and afterwards through a
fair Garden, where those of our Retinue found their Divertisement??? while the Ambassadors,
with their Interpreter, were employ'd about their affairs. The King had the patience to stay
there two hours and better, and as we came out thence, Dinner was going in, whereto all
the Company was invited, all being placed, and treated in the same manner as we had been
before.
                  Aug. the 28.Celebrate the Festival of St. Augustine. the Augustine Friers came to intreat the Ambassadors to honour them with
their Presence the next day, at the Celebration of the Festival of their Patron St. Augustine.
They desired the same favour of the Muscovian Posanick, Alexei Savinouits,, as also of an
Armenian Bishop, and the English Merchants, who, though of a different Religion, and that
in Europe they would have made some difficulty to be present at the Ceremonies of the Roman-Catholick
Church, live like Brethren and true Christians, among their common Enemies.
                  There were in the Monastery in all, but six Spanish Monks, and yet they had built a very vast
Structure, with a very fair Church belonging to it, which had two Steeples, but somewhat low,
a stately Cloister, several Cells, and a large Garden.
                  The Ambassadors went thither on Horseback, in regard that, though the Monastery were
within the City, yet was it above a League from our quarters; and the Religious men, who
receiv'd them at the entrance of the Monastery, conducted them straight to the Church, which
was adorn'd with abundance of Pictures, and Gilt in several places. They presently began
Mass, during which we had pretty good Musick, for one of their Monks had some skill upon
the Organ, and our Musicians had brought thither their Lutes and Violins. After Mass, we
were carried into the Garden, near a Fountain, and under the shade of a Tree, the branches
whereof were so full of Leaves, and so woven one within another, that they compass'd the
Fountain, and in several places reaching down to the ground, they made convenient seats. The
Clock striking twelve,Dle in the Monastery. we were brought into a fair Hall, where we were feared at three several
Tables, which were plac'd all along the Walls, after the same manner as may be seen in the
Monasteries of Religious men in Europe.
                  The Tables were cover'd with all sorts of Fruits, in dishes of Porcelane, and the Cloath was
all strew'd with Flowers. Every one had his dish of Meat by himself, plenty of all things, and
all very well dress'd, yet not without some respect to frugality. After Dinner, which lasted
not so long as we had been at the entertainments of the Persians, or those we were invited to
by some forein Merchants, we return'd into the Garden, where we pass'd away the remainder
of the day, under the shade of the same Tree.
                  VVith the beginning of September,SEPT. we began to be sensible of a change of the weather???
The great heats were so much abated, that the Nights began to be tedious and
troublesome,Two Armenian Lords visit the Ambassadors. especially to those who had not been carefull to provide themselves good
Coverlets.
                  About this time Seferas-beg, Governour of Armenia, accompany'd by his two Brothers,
came to see the Ambassadors, with a design to make acquaintance, and contract Friendship

with them. They were all three persons of an excellent good disposition, free in their Conversation
and Civil, which gain'd so much upon the nature of the Ambassador Brugman, who lov'd
people of that Kidney, and was himself of a free Humour, that he presented the two Elder,
each of them, with a handsome Fowling-piece, and the younger with a Case of Pistols. They
took those Presents so kindly, that, to express their gratitude, they resolv'd to make an Entertainment
for the Ambassadors, for which they appointed the 18 of September, and entreated
them to bring all their Retinue along with them. They sent us Horses to bring us, and some
of the Armenian Merchants to accompany us.
                  We brought along with us two Portuguez Monks, the Prior of the Augustines, and our ordinary
Interpreter. Seferas-beg receiv'd the Ambassadors at the entrance of the Church, in the
Suburbs called Tzulfa, where he had the service said by the Patriarch of the place, who had
about him a Cope of Cloath of Silver, with flowers of Gold, beset with great Pearls, and a
Mitre of the same Stuff, cover'd all over with round Pearls. The Body of the Church was adorn'd
with several large Pictures, the floor was cover'd with the Tapistry of the Country, and
they had placed benches all along the walls for our more convenient sitting. They had also a
kind of wretched Musick. Having done our Devotions, we got on horse-back again to goe to
the place where the entertainment was prepared for us. Seferas-beg, having receiv'd the Ambassadors
with much respect, and done his civilities to the chiefest of the Retinue, conducted
them, through a spacious arched Gallery, into a great Garden, at the end whereof we found
an open hall, according to the fashion of the Country, where we were intreated to sit down
on the ground. The Cloath, which was of Gold and Silver Brocado, was cover'd with all
sorts of Fruits and Conserves, and we drank of a certain prepar'd water, much like Ros Solis,
but incomparably more delicate, and more precious. Having taken away the Fruits, they laid
an Indian Cotton cloath, and the Meat was brought up, in silver Dishes. It was excellently
well dress'd, according to the Persian way of dressing, with this difference only, that at this
entertainment there was brought in Pork, and some other sorts of flesh, for which the Persians
have an aversion. We had hardly eaten so much as allay'd our first hunger, ere we were forc'd
to rise from the Table, to be conducted through a very noble apartment, into another hall,
which look'd into the Garden. It was arched all about, and there were on the Walls certain
Pictures representing the Women of most Nations in the World, dress'd according to the mode
of their several Countries. The floor was cover'd with rich Tapistry, on which were laid
Cushions of flower'd Satin, the ground-work thereof Gold and Silver. In the midst of the
hall, there was a Fountain, the Basin whereof was of white Marble; the water was cover'd
with Flowers; and it was beset all about with Flaggons, and Bottles of Wine.
                  We were invited to sit down, and to eat of the Fruit and Conserves, which were brought
in, during which we had the Divertisement of Musick and Dancing. And as a further honour
to us,Musick. the Patriarch was sent for, who came in immediately, having about him a Cassock of
water'd Chamlet of a Violet Colour, and attended by two Priests clad in black, with Caps on
their Heads. He was no ill Company: but the second of the two Brethren, whose name was
Elias-beg, made the best sport of any in the company. For, to heighten the Divertisement of
the Ambassadors, he would needs play on the Tamera, which is an Instrument used by the
Persians instead of the Late: and then he call'd for seven Porcelane Cups,Porcelane Musick. full of water, and
striking them with two little sticks, he accorded them with the Lute. While we were hearkning
to this Musick, Seferas-beg told us, that he would give us a kind of Musick, which
should be as delightful as the other; and thereupon rising up, he ordered to be brought him,
by two Pages, in two great wooden Dishes, several Chrystal Glasses, which he distributed among
the Company, to whom he began the King of Persia's health. The whole day was spent
in these divertisements,The magnificence of an Armenian Lord. till that the Ambassadors perceiving night approach, took leave of
their Hosts; but these, pretending to conduct us out of the house, brought us to the other side
of the Garden, into a Gallery, where we found the Cloath laid, and cover'd with all sorts of
Meat, Flesh, Fish, Pies, Fruits and Conserves, for the Collation. We sat down again, but it
was only out of compliance, for it is not to be imagin'd we could have eaten ought. Nor indeed
can I believe, that he by whom we were entertain'd had any other design therein than to
shew his Magnificence, and the Gallantry and Freedome of his Nature, especially in his Conversion
of the darkest Night to bright Day. The Hall was all full of Lamps, which hung by a
string fasten'd to the Roof, there being so great a number of them, and those so near one the other,
that their Lights were so confounded, as that they made but one. There was also in
the Garden, a great number of Torches and Candles, which wrought the same effect
there.
                  Having, with much ado and many Complements, taken our leave, we could not by any
means put off the second Brother out of a humour had taken him to accompany us to our Lodgings,
where he made a shift to get perfectly drunk, with Aquavitae and Ros Solis. And thus we
concluded that day, which I confess was one of the most pleasant we had had in all our Travels,
having been better treated, than we had been by the King himself.
                  
                     
The 19. The Ambassadors had their second private audience, which the King gave them in
another apartment, at the end of a Garden, and which lasted not above half an hour; in regard
the Council took time to consider of the Memorials they receiv'd in writing from them.The second private Audience. It is
ordinary to stay and Dine at the Court after the Conferences; therefore I shall forbear repeating
the Circumstances, unless something in particular oblige me thereto: as it happen'd this
day, in that the King having heard that the Ambassadors had Musicians in their Retinue, he sent
them word, that he would gladly hear their Musick. It consisted of a base Viol, a Tenor, and
a Violin, which play'd about half an hour, till the King sent us word, that that Musick was not
ill, but that he thought that of the Country as good as it.
                  The 25. of September,The Ambassadors treated by the English. the English made an entertainment for the Ambassadors and all their
Retinue, which, in Magnificence, surpass'd all the rest. Their House or Lodge, was in the
Basar, near the Maidan. The Structure was of great extent, divided into several appartments,
and had a very fair Garden. We were at first brought into a Gallery, where we found Fruits
and Conserves laid upon the floor, which was cover'd with Tapistry, according to the custom
of the Country; and having done there, we pass'd into a great Hall, where we found the Table
furnish'd and serv'd after the English fashion.
                  They forgot not to drink the healths of most of the Kings and Princes of Europe, and we had
the Divertisement of Musick upon the Virginals. After Dinner, we were brought into
an open Hall, which look'd into the Garden, where we found a Collation of Conserves, with
the best Wine the Countrey could afford, And whereas we had often seen the Dancing-women
of the Country,Indian Dancing-Women. they sent for some Indian Women of the same profession. There were brought
six young Women, whereof some had their Husbands with them, who also either Danc'd or
Play'd upon Violins; some came in alone. They were all somewhat of an Olive-colour, but
had excellent good Features,Handsome and well shap'd. a delicate smooth Skin, and very handsome Bodies. They had
about their Necks much Gold and Pearls, and in their Ears Pendants of Gold or Silver, glittering
with Jewels and Spangles.
                  Some of them had Bracelets of Pearl, others of Silver, but they had all Rings on their Fingers,
and among the rest, they had upon the Thumb, upon which, in the place where the Stone
should be, there was a piece of Steel, about the bigness of a Crown-piece of Silver, and so well
polish'd, that it serv'd them for a Looking-glass. They were Cloath'd after a particular manner,Their habit
having on a kind of Stuff, which was so thin, that there was not any part of the Body but
might be seen by the Company, save only what was hidden by the Drawers which they wore
under their Petticoats. Some wore Caps on their Heads, others had them dress'd in Tiffany,
and some had silk Skarfs, wrought with Gold and Silver, which crossing their shoulders reach'd
down to the ground. Some were bare-foot, others were shod after a very strange manner. They
had above the instap of the foot a string ty'd, with little Bells fastened thereto, whereby they
discover'd the exactness of their Cadence, and sometimes corrected the Musick it self; as they
did also by the Tzarpanes, or Castagnetts, which they had in their hands, in the managing
whereof they were very expert. Their Musick consisted of Timbrels, according to the Indian
way of Playing on them, Tabors, and Pipes.
                  The Indian Timbrels are two foot long, but broader in the middle than at the extremities,
much after the fashion of our Barrels. They hang them about their Necks, and play on them
with their fingers. The postures of these Indian VVomen in their Dancing are admirable.
Their hands and feet are alwayes in action, as is also their whole Body: and many times, they
address themselves to some particular person of the Company, either by an inclination of the
Body, or to get the little Present they expect, which they very handsomely beg, either by
stretching out their hands, yet so as that it seems to be done without any affectation, but as a
necessary consequence of the Dance. They are much more pleasant in their Conversation than
the Women of the Countrey. All these Dancing-women are common prostitutes, and very
free to shew all their postures for money, nay to do beyond what might be expected from
them. It was far-night ere we got away, which oblig'd the English to bring us home to our
Lodgings.
                  The French Merchants made also an entertainment for the principal persons of our Retinue,
and treated them, with some of the English Merchants, at a Caravansera, very handsomely.
                  The first of October,OCTOB. the Ambassadors made a great Feast, whereto were invited the Muscovian
Ambassador,The Ambassadors make a feast. the Governour of Armenia, and his two Brothers, the chiefest of the English
and French Merchants, the Spanish Monks of the order of St. Augustine, and some Italian
Carmelites. They treated them after the German way, with three several Courses, each consisting
of forty Dishes. The Musick consisted of Violins, Trumpets, and Timbrels, which made
a goodly Noise, as did also our Cannon, when any Prince's health was drunk.
                  The Prince of Armenia, was taken, above all things, with certain services of Paste and Sugar,
according to the German fashion, which were brought to the Table, rather to divert the
Eye, than to sharpen the Appetite: and thought them so good, that having spoken of them at

Court, the King would needs see some. Whence it came that the Ambassadors ordered some
of them to be made by our Cook; as also some Florentines, and other pieces of Pastry of that
kind, which he took very kindly, and presented them to some Ladies about the Court, who
thought them excellent good Meat.
                  In the afternoon they had the Divertisement of seeing some run at the Ring,Running at a Ring. at which M.
Mandelslo got the prize, which was a great Silver Goblet, and the Ambassador Brugman did
the best next him, and got a drinking Cup Vermilion gilt. Every time any one put into the
Ring, one of the Brass pieces was fired.
                  The next day the Prior of the Augustines came to the Secretary of the Embassy,The scandalous Life of one of the Ambassadors. to complain
to him of the debauch'd Lives of some of our Retinue, nay one of the chiefest among us, naming
particularly the Ambassador Brugman, and discover'd that there were some among us, who,
after the example of the Armenians, had married Women of the Country. He told him, that
they had conceived a great joy and comfort, at the first news of our Embassy's coming thither,
out of a hope, that our Lives would be an example to the Christians of the Country, who living
among Mahumetans, were apt to fall into their vices and filthiness; but that, to his great
regret, he found the contrary: entreating the Secretary, to speak of it to those in whose power
it was to take some course therein, so to prevent the scandal which was given to others, the
injury done to the name of Christ, and the infamy which must fall on the Prince, from whom
the Embassy was sent. The Secretary went, with a resolution to give the Ambassador Brugman
an accompt of these Remonstrances of the Priors, and to intreat him that some course might be
taken, that the Domesticks might reform their Lives; but it was his misfortune, that coming
into the Ambassador's Chamber, he found him in the company of an Armenian Woman, named
Tulla. But the Ambassador Brugman imagining the Secretary's design had been to surprize
him, was so incens'd thereat, that having sworn he would resent that affront, the Secretary,
who had experience of his Revengefull and Irreconcilable disposition, retir'd to the Monastery
of the Augustines, with an intention absolutely to quit his Relation to the Embassy, and to
accept of the proffer which the Carmelites made him, to give him directions how to go for Babylon,
and so by Aleppo into Italy, and thence into Germany. But the Ambassador coming to
hear of the course he intended to take, sent him word, that if he did prosecute it, he would have
him kill'd where-ever he were met: which he might the more easily have effected, in that the
Caravans having their appointed places for Lodging, he might have found out a Persian, who,
for a small matter, would have murther'd him. This apprehension, and the advice of some
friends oblig'd the Secretary to intreat the Prior of the Augustines, to intercede for him, and
to make his peace with Brugman; whereupon he return'd to the Ambassadors quarters, after
he had staid thirteen dayes in the Monastery.
                  About this time,Ceremonies of Marriage among the Armenians. I went to the Suburbs of Tzulfa, with an intention to visit some Armenian
Merchants, with whom I had had occasion to make acquaintance at the entertainments which
had been made us. Coming near their Church, I saw going thither one that was to be Married???
whom I had the curiosity to follow, purposely to see the Ceremonies of the Marriage. In the
front of the Procession march'd their ordinary Musick, consisting of Timbrels, and Tabors,
and after them went a Youth of about twelve or fifteen years of age, who had a wax Candle in
his hand. The Bride-groom, who immediately follow'd the youth, was on Horse-back, clad in
flower'd Satin, of several colours, and had on both sides of him two Men, handsome Persons,
and very richly Cloath'd, as were also the other four who follow'd them, in two ranks. After
them were carried two dishes of Meat, two pitchers of Wine, and so many dishes of Apples.
The Bride-groom being come to the Church, sate down with those who were come along with
him, and call'd for the Meat and Fruit to be brought and set before him; but did not eat of either.
Those who had accompany'd him fell to it, but eat not much, and the rest was sav'd for
the Priest, who was to bless the Marriage, save only the Wine, which was all drunk off. The
Bride-groom having taken notice of me; rose up, and taking, on his right hand, a young Lad,
and, on the left, one of those Men, who had accompany'd him thither, came straight to me, saluted
me, pour'd out himself of the Wine into an earthen Cup, and intreated me to drink, but
he himself would not taste of it. In the mean time, the Bride came into the Church, having,
on the right hand a young Maid, and, on the left, a Married Woman; all three with their faces
cover'd with a thin Lawn. The Priest, having brought them near the Altar, read several
Prayers, and blest the Marriage, by holding a wooden Cross over the Married couple, who
in the mean time gave one another their hands, and joyn'd their heads together, yet so, as that
the Bride's head touch the Bride-groom's breast, to whom, by that action, she acknowledg'd
her self bound to submit, mutually promising fidelity and loyalty one to the other, under the
Cross, that is, in misfortunes and afflictions. That done, the Priest gave them the Communion,
delivering to each of them a piece of the Consecrated Hoast steep'd in Wine.
                  I say, of the Hoast, inasmuch as the bread of the Eucharist is not here leavened as in Muscovy,
and other places, in the Greek Church, but is made of a paste without Leaven, about the
bigness and thickness of a Crown piece of Silver. While the Communion was administred,

they sung, and play'd on certain great Cymbals, which the Armenians call Hambarzon. They
never communicate without that kind of Mnsick, which they believe to be so much the more
necessary, in that they say our Saviour, when he was to feed four thousand men with seven
Loaves, went first up into the Mountain, where he offered his Prayers in Sacrifice to God,
and that while he pray'd, two Angels came down from Heaven; and play'd upon that kind of
Cymbals. After the Communion, they cast Rose-water upon the new-Married couple, and all
the company, and ty'd a Scarf about the Bride's right hand, by which the Bridegroom draws
her after him to the Church door, where all the company get on Horse-back, to goe to the
place where there is a Feast prepared for them. For the three first nights after the Marriage, the
Married couple touch not one another.
                  Coming out of this Church, I pass'd by another, where hearing a great noise, I went into
it.The Baptism of the Armenians. The noise was made by striking with a great stick upon a deal board that was hung up, which
the Armenians are forc'd to make use of instead of Bells, the Persians, it seems, not permitting
them to make use of any. I found that this Ceremony was perform'd in order to the Christning
of a Child. There were in the Church, only the Priest and his Clark, an aged Woman
who had brought the Child thither: and stood in a corner of the Church, and a young man,
about eighteen years of age, who presented the Child to be Baptiz'd. After the Priest had said
certain Prayers, and made several Questions to the God-father, this latter carry'd the Child
to the Woman, who unswath'd it, and then the Priest, Clark and the God-father went into
the Sacristy, where the Font stood within the Wall, being made like a little Trough, half an
ell in length, and a quarter in breadth. The Priest, having consecrated the Water, and put into
it some consecrated Oyl, put the Child, naked, into the Font, and Baptiz'd him, in the
Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, pouring water three several times upon his
Head. Then he poured water all over the Body, and made the sign of the Cross in his Forehead,
with consecrated Oyl. The Armenians Christen not their Children, till they are full
eight days old, unless they be weak; for in that case, they do it before, out of a belief, that
the children, who dye without Baptism, are damned; whence it also comes, that they bury
them not in the Church-yard, no more than they do those aged persons, who have not communicated
once within a year.
                  The 3. of October,The Tragical History of a Clock-maker. there was put into Prison a German Clock-maker, a menial Servant of
the King of Persia's. His name was Iohn Rodolph Stadler, born at Zurich in Switzerland. He
was aged about 38 years, and had Married the sister of that Tulla; whom we spoke of before.
He had been five years in the King's service, and growing weary of being so long among inidels,
he was desirous to take the opportunity of our Embassy to return into his own Country.
He had, to that end, desired his Majesties leave, to depart the Kingdom, and the King, who
had an affection for him, had promis'd him a Present of four hundred Crowns, to oblige him
to stay two years longer in Persia: but that was so far from prevailing with him, that, on the
contrary, he continu'd his importunities for his departure, and, to that end, got the Ambassadors
to intercede for him. In the mean time, a House-breaker coming one night into his house,
out of a hope to find there the four hundred Crowns, the Clock-maker, who perceiv'd him,
fell upon him, got him down, and having hurt him in several places, thrust him out of Doors.
Afterwards, upon second thoughts, repenting himself, that he had suffered him to escape so,
he took a Pistol, run after him, and kill'd him. The friends of the Deceas'd went immediately
to the Ecclesiastical Judge, and made complaints of the Murther, committed by a Stranger
and an Infidel, upon one of the Faithful, demanded Justice of him, and desir'd, that the
Murtherer might be put into their hands, in order to his Execution. The Clock-maker who
little thought he should be troubled for the death of a Robber, got on horse-back the next day
to go to the Court; but he was taken in the street, and immediately put into the Palenk, which
is a wooden Instrument, which comes about the Arms and the Neck, and very cruelly handled.
The Ambassadors us'd much solicitation on his behalf, but the animosity of the Relations, and
the authority of the Spiritual Judge, whom they call Mufti, carried it against him, so
that he was condemn'd to dye; with this Proviso nevertheless, that if he would be circumcis'd,
and embrace the Religion of the Mussulmans, it should be in the King's power
to pardon him.
                  Most of the Lords, who had a great respect for him upon the account of his Profession, wherein
he was Excellent, press'd him very much to change his Religion, at least in outward shew,
and for a time, promising him those advantages which he could not expect in Germany. He
was two several times conducted to the place of execution, in the Maidan, before the Palace-Gate,
that he might see the horrour of death before his eyes, out of an imagination; that
would oblige him to renounce: but he equally slighted both promises and threats, his constancy
could not be shaken, and he wav'd all they said to him, with so resolute a courage, that it
is not to be doubted but it was supernatural, and that his death was a kind of Martyrdom. He
told them, that the King's favour should never make him lose that which Iesus Christ had done
him, by redeeming him from eternal death, by his blood: That being entertain'd into the

King's service, his Majesty might dispose of his body, but that he would render up his Soul to
him by whom it was created, that he might be therein glorify'd both in this World and the
next. The Augustin Monks, and the Carmelites, endeavour'd all they could, to oblige him to
make profession of the Roman Catholick Religion; but he continu'd firm to his former resolution,
and would die in the Reform'd Religion, which he profess'd, and wherein he was perfectly
well instructed.
                  At last,Is execute??? the Persians, finding it impossible to overcome his courage, either by fair or foul
means, left him to the Relations of the deceas'd, who had the execution of him. He among
them who went out to give him the first blow with the Cimitar, miss'd him, and wounded his
next neighbour the Leg; the second struck into the Palenk, which they had left about his
neck; the third struck him upon the neck, and smote down that Martyr of Christ, who afterwards
receiv'd three other blows, ere he expir'd; the first in the head, and the other two, in
the face.
                  The Ambassador Brugman, who, as I said before, had a great kindness for this German's
sister-in-law, was so enrag'd at this execution, that being at a loss of all judgement, and not
knowing what to do for madness, he would needs divert himself by running at the Ring, in the
presence of two or three Gentlemen, and the Canonier, causing, in the mean time, the great
Guns to be fired above a hundred times. The body lay all that day expos'd to the sight of those
that pass'd by, in the place where the execution had been done; till that in the evening, the
Ambassador Brugman, with the King's permission, caus'd it to be brought to our Lodgings, with
an intention to have it buried the next day. But the King having appointed that day to go a-hunting,
and invited the Ambassadors to that Divertisement; it was put off; so that the Ceremonies
of the enterment could not be performed till the 22.His enterment. The Muscovian Ambassador, the
Governour of Armenia and his brothers, most of the Armenians, and those of the Sect of
Nessera, of which the Widdow of the deceas'd made profession (and whereof we shall discourse
hereafter, as also of the other Europaean Christians) honour'd his Funeral with their
presence.
                  The Hunting,The King takes the Ambassadors along with him a-hunting??? we spoke of before, began the 17. The night before, the Mehemandar
came to acquaint the Ambassadors, that his Majesty had, for their sakes, appointed a Hunting,
that should last several dayes, and that it was his pleasure, they should have notice of it, that
they might be ready against the next morning. It was imagin'd this was done out of design, that
the Ambassadors might not be in person at the interment of the Clock-maker, but that hindred
not the Ambassador Brugman from giving order that the body should be kept till his return.
                  The 17. betimes in the morning, there were Horses brought for the Persons, and Camels for
the Baggage. The Ambassadors got on Horse-back, with Father Ioseph, and about thirty persons
of their Retinue. The Mehemandar conducted them into a spacious Plain, whither the
King came soon after, attended by above three hundred Lords, all excellently well mounted,
and smptuously cloath'd. The King himself was in a Vestment of Silver Brocado, with a Turbant
adorn'd with most noble Heron's Feathers, and having led after him four Horses, whereof
the Saddles, Harness, and covering Cloaths were beset with Gold and precious Stones. The
King at his coming up very civilly saluted the Ambassadors, and ordered them to march near
him on his left hand.
                  The other Chans and great Lords march'd after the King,An Astrologer. with so little observance of order,
that many times the Servants were shuffled in among their Masters. There was, among the
rest, in the King's Retinue, an Astrologer, who alwayes kept very close to him, and ever and
anon observ'd the position of the Heavens, that he might prognosticate what good or ill fortune
should happen. These are believ'd as Oracles. We rode up and down that day above three
Leagues, the King taking occasion often to change his Horse and upper Garments, which he did
every day while the Hunting lasted. The morning was spent in Hawking, the Hawks were let
out at Herns, Cranes, Drakes, nay sometimes at Crows, which they either met with by
chance, or were set purposely upon. About noon, we came to an Armenian Village, where
we found a great number of Tents of divers colours, pitch'd after an odd kind of way; which
yet made a very pleasant Prospect. After the King had been brought by his Grandes into his
Tent, they came for the Ambassadors, who with some of their Gentlemen and Officers Dined
with him. There was nothing extraordinary; Fruits and Conserves were brought in first, and
afterwards the Meat, upon a kind of Bier, or Barrow, which was cover'd all over with plates
of Gold, and it was serv'd in Dishes of the same metal.
                  In the after-noon, the Mehemandar carried the Ambassadors to be Lodg'd in another Village,
about a quarter of a League from the place where the King had his Tents. The Inhabitants of
those Villages are Armenians, and they are called Desach, and Werende, from the Countrey,
where they liv'd before, near Iruan, whence they were heretofore translated by Schach-Abas,
to the end, that, living near Ispahan, they might be employ'd about the Vines. When they
understood we were Christians, they entertain'd us much more kindly, and made us several

Presents of Fruits and Wine. Scferas-beg, and some other Lords gave the Ambassadors a Visit,
to be merry, and participate of a Collaion with them. They brought along with them two of
those fallow Deer, which the Pesians call Ahu's and some Herns, which we sent to Ispahan.
The King coming to hear that the Mchemandar had Lodg'd us in another Village, was very
much displeas'd at it, and commanded that we should be brought the same night, to be Quarter'd
in the next house to that where he was Lodg'd himself; which was accordingly done, and
our Supper was brought us out of the Kings Kitchin, in Dishes of Gold.
                  The 18. betimes in the morning, the King sent the Ambassadors word, that he would go
with very few persons about him,Crane-hunting. a Crane-Hunting, intreating them that they would bring
along with them only their Interpreter, out of this respect, that the Cranes might not be frightned,
by the great number of people, and that the pleasure of the Hunting might not be disturb'd
by too much noise. The Ambassadors took only Father Ioseph along with them: but the sport
was no sooner begun with the day, ere they sent for all the Retinue. They had made a great
secret way under-ground, at the end whereof there was a field. about which they had scatter'd
some Wheat. The Cranes came thither in great numbers, and there were above fourscore taken.
The King took some of their feathers, to put into his Mendil, or Turbant, and gave two
to each of the Ambassadors, who put them into their Hats. That done, they rode up and
down the fields, and spent the time in Hawking, till that drawing towards noon, the King went
to take his repast in the same house, where he had Dined the day before, and was in a very good
humour. They had sent for his Musick thither.
                  At night, he sent to entreat the Ambassadors to come only with six persons along with them,
to the hunting of the Drake and Wild-Goose,Drake, and Wild-goose-hunting. at a place, half a League from the Village. They
all alighted within two hundred paces of the place where they expected the sport, and went into
a great Hut built of Earth, near which they had hidden the Nets upon the side of a small
Brook, where there is abundance of fresh-water Fowl. The King caus'd us to sit down all
about the walls of the Hut, and oblig'd us to help him off with some Bottles of excellent Wine,
which was all the Divertisement we had that day. For, not so much as one Bird appearing, we
return'd to our quarters, where the King sent us cold Mutton, boyl'd and roasted, sowr Sheeps
milk, which they account a great delicacy, Cheese, and several Vessels full of Citrons, and
other Fruits, raw and preserv'd.
                  The next day was our greatest day for sport,Leopards. the King having ordered to be brought to the
field, a great nmber of Hawks, and three Leopards taught to hunt: but very few Dogs. Having
spent some time in beating the bushes up and down, and found nothing, the King carried
us into a great Park, which was above two Leagues about. The Persians call it Hazartzirib,
that is, a place where a thousand bushels of Wheat may be sown. It was compass'd with a very
high Wall, and divided into three Partitions. In the first were kept Harts Wild-Goats,
Deer, Hares, and Foxes. In the second were kept that kind of Deer, which they call Ahu's;
and in the third??? Wild Asses, which they call Kouhrhan. The King first commanded the Leopards
to be let in among the Ahu's, and they took each of them one, Thence we went to the
wild Asses, and the King seeing one of them at a stand, spoke to the Ambassador Brugman to
fire his Pistol at it, and perceiving that he miss'd it, he took an Arrow, and though he Rid in
full speed, shot it directly into the breast of the Beast. Another he took just in the Fore-head,
and afterwards he wounded others in several places. He never fail'd, though he alwayes shot
Riding in full speed. He was as well skill'd at his Sword as at his Bow; for perceiving one of
the wild Asses could hardly go, he alights, and going directly to the Beast, gave it a blow with
his Sword over the Back, with which single blow he cleft it down to the Belly. He struck another
with his Cymitar over the Neck, with so much strength and slight, that there wanted not
an inch of his having cut it clear off. One of the Chans took the King's Sword, wip'd it clean,
and put it into the Scabbard. Then we all went to another small Partition, that was in the middle
of the Park.
                  At the entrance of this enclosed place, the King commanded one of the two Huntsmen who
carried his Fowling-piece after him, to shoot at a wild Ass, which had before been wounded
with an Arrow. The antienter man of the two thinking it a disparagement to him, that the
command was directed to the younger, would needs prevent him, shot at the Beast, and miss'd.
The company laugh'd at him, which put him into such madness, that suffering the King to go
on, he returns to his Camerade, drew his Sword upon him, and cut off the Thumb of his
right hand. The wounded party makes his complaints to the King, who immediately commanded
the others head to be brought him: but upon the Mediation of several of the Grandees,
his punishment was changed, and he had only his Ears cut off. The Executioner, I know not
upon what inducement,A Persian Lord turns Executioner. cut off but some part of the Ear; which the Grand-Master, Mortusaculi-Chan
perceiving, and thinking the man had foul play done him to have ought of his Ears
left, alighted, took out his own knife, and cut off what the Executioner had left; to the great
astonishment of all us, who were not accustomed to see Persons of that quality turn common
Executioners.
                  
                     
Within the enclosed place I spoke of, there was a little building much after the fashion of a
Theatre, into which the King brought us, to a Collation of Fruits and Conserves. That done,
there were driven into the place thirty two wild Asses, at which the King discharg'd some shots
with the Fowling-pieces, and shot some Arrows, and afterwards permitted the Ambassadors,
and the other Lords to shoot at them.
                  It was pretty sport to see those Asses run, having sometimes ten or more Arrows shot into
their Bodies, wherewith they incommodated and wounded the others when they got in among
them, so that they fell a biting one another, and running one at another after a strange manner.
Having knock'd down all those that were wounded,Wild-Assesh much esteem'd in Persia. there were let in thirty wild Asses more,
which they also kill'd and laid them all in a row before the King, to be sent to Ispahan, to the
Court Kitchin. The Persians so highly esteem the flesh of these wild Asses, that they have
brought it into a Proverb in their Kulusthan.
                  This kind of Hunting being over,Presents from one of the Ambassadors to the King Dinner was brought in at the same place. Here it was,
that the Ambassador Brugman was pleas'd, upon his own account, to present the King of Persia,
with his Highness the Duke of Holstein's Picture, in a Box all beset with Diamonds, as also
with a very fair Steel Looking-Glass, polish'd on both sides, and embellish'd with several Figures,
grav'd by that famous Artist, Iohn Dresde, and done after an Excellent way, whereof he
himself had been the Inventor.
                  After Dinner, we retir'd into some houses thereabouts, to take our Mid-dayes repose. The
King sent us thither ten Ahues, and a very fair Stagg, the horns whereof had twelve browancklers:
but ere we were well laid down, word was brought us, that the King was got on
Horse-back, in order to some further sport. We immediately follow'd, and found him a
Hawking. He soon gave over that sport, and taking along with him nine persons of his own
Retinue, and six of ours, he went into a spacious low Walk, at the end whereof there was a
place for the keeping of wild-Dacks: but instead of hunting, he must needs fall a Drinking, and
was so dispos'd to mirth, that the noise we made, kept the Ducks and Geese from coming near
the place. The King did Monsieur Mandelslo the favour, to permit him to present him with a
Glass of Wine, and after he had drunk, and that Mandelslo had kiss'd his knee, he presented
him with an Apple, which is an expression of so particular a kindness, that the whole Court began
to look on him, from that time, as a Person very much in the King's favour.
                  The Kerek jerak, or ordinary Steward of his Majesties Houshold, whose name was Mahumed
Aly-beg, who had fill'd the King his drink during this Debauch, and had not forgot to
take off his own, was grown so drunk, that, sitting at the entrance of the Walk, he made such
a noise, that the King sent one to bid him get thence, and perceiving no intreaties would prevail
with him, he commanded him to be dragg'd thence, and set on horse-back.
                  Aiy-beg could not hinder their dragging of him thence, but they were not able to set him
on horse-back, nay he abus'd and struck those that should have done it. The King goes out of
the Gallery, and would have perswaded him to get on horse-back, but he was no better treated
than the rest, so that laying his hand on his Sword, he made as if he would have cut off his
head. The fright which that put the Steward into, made him cry out so loud, that the whole
company concern'd themselves in the fear he was in.
                  He was very much in his Prince's favour, but knew him to be a person not to be jeasted withall,
and he had??? so many sad examples of it before his Eyes, that the terrors of Death did, in
a moment, disperse the Vapours, which had unsetled his Brain, and bestow'd wings on those
Feet, which the Wine had made unable to go. He immediately got on horse-back, and rid away
as fast as his horse could carry him, and so made a shift to escape that time. The king who
was got into a pleasant humour, only Laugh'd at it; he came very merrily in to us; but withdrew
soon after, and we went and were lodg'd in our own quarters.
                  The 20. there was no hunting at all. We dined with the king, who was that day serv'd by a
hundred young Men, very handsome Persons, and richly Clad, who alwayes stood before him.
Many of our Retinue would rather have kept those Gentlemen company, and waited, than have
been among the Guests, by reason of the trouble it was to them to sit according to the manner
of the Country. This entertainment was made in a pleasant Summer-house that stood in the
midst of a Garden, upon the water-side. In the afternoon, we went to another Village, about
a League and a half from the City, and, in our way, took a white Heron.
                  The 21. the king sent betimes in the Morning to invite us to go a Pidgeon-hunting.Pidgeon-Hunting. We were
carried up to the top of a great Tower, within which there were above a thousand Nests. We
were plac'd all without, having in our hands little sticks forked at the ends. The king commanded
our Trumpets to sound a charge, and immediately there were driven out of the Tower
or Pidgeon-house, great numbers of Pidgeons, which were most of them kill'd by the king and
those of his Company. This was the end of that kind of hunting, after which we took our
way towards the City: but ere we got into it, the king carried us into one of his Gardens, called
Tzarbach, which is no doubt the fairest of any we have seen in Persia, where we had another
Manificent treatment. As soon as we were got to our Lodgings, there were brought us,

from the King, twelve wild Drakes, and as many Pidgeons; but they were provided, it seems,
only for the Ambassador Brugman and his Ladies.
                  Somes days afterwards it was publish'd by the Tzartzi or publick Crier, all over the City,
that all should keep within their houses, and that none should presume to come into the street;
the King being to goe that way abroad, to give the Court Ladies the Divertisement of
Hunting.
                  The custom of the Country is, that the King's Wives and Concubines should not go abroad,
unless it be in certain Chests or Cabinets, which are covered all over, and carried by Camels.
All which notwithstanding, they permit not, that, while they are passing by, there should be
any one in the Streets, or that any men should come within Musket-shot of the field where
they are, upon pain of present Death. The King goes before, and the Ladies follow about half
an hour after, accompany'd by their Women, and a great number of Eunuchs. When they
are come into the field, they get on Horse-back, carry Hawks on their fists, and use their Bows
and Arrows as well as the men.
                  Only the King and the Eunuchs stay among the Women; all the rest of the men are about
half a League from them, and when the sport is begun, no man is to come within two Leagues
of them, unless the King send for him by an Eunuch. The Lords of the Court in the mean
time hunt some other way. The King return'd from this Hunting, Nov. 26. so Drunk, as were
also most of his Lords, that they could hardly sit their horses. They made a halt at the said
house called Tzarbach, and had engag'd themselves into that Debauch, upon a great Bridge
which is at the entrance of the Park, where the great Lords had danc'd in his Presence, and
found him such excellent sport, that those who did best, had great Presents bestow'd on them.
It was observ'd to be his particular Humour, that he was very liberal in his Debauches, and many
times gave away so much, that the next day he repented him of it.
                  Some eight days after this great Hunting-match we had an example of his Liberality in that
kind.The King liberal in his Debauches. For, one day, being desirous to drink in the after-noon, and most of the company having
left him, there being with him only the Eahtemad dowlet, and some Eunuchs, he caus'd a
great Cup to be fill'd, which he ordered to be presented to the Chancellor, with a command,
that he should drink his health. The Chancellor, who was not given to those Excesses, would
have excus'd himself, but the King drew out his Sword, set it by the Cup, and bid him take his
choice, either Drink, or Dye.
                  The Chancellor finding he had the Woolf by the Ears, and not knowing how to avoid drinking,
takes the Cup in his hand, and was going to drink; but perceiving the King a little turn'd
about, he rises and gets away. The King was extremely incens'd thereat, and sent for him,
but upon answer brought, that he was not to be found, he gave the Cup to an Achta or Eunuch.
He would also have excus'd himself, pretending he had not Drunk any Wine for a good
while before, and that if he took off that Cup, it would infallibly be the Death of him; but
the King was not satisfy'd with those excuses, and taking up his Sword would have kill'd him,
if a Mehater, or Gentleman belonging to his Chamber had not prevented him, yet did he
not do it so clearly, but that he himself was hurt in the Leg, and the Eunuch in the hand. The
King, who would have his will, finding all had left him, address'd himself to one of his Pages,
the on of Alymerdan-Chan, Governour of Candahar, who was a very handsom young Lad,
and ask'd him, whether he had the courage to venture at the drinking off of that Cup. The
young Lad made answer, that he knew not what he might be able to do, and that he would do
his endeavour, whereupon kneeling down before the King, he took several draughts of it. At
last, thinking it too great a task to go through, and finding himself animated by the Wine, and
the King's obliging expressions, who still egg'd him on to Drink, he rises, cast his arms about
the King's neck, kisses him, and says, Patscha humse alla, taala menum itzund' Ischock jasch
wersun; that is, I pray God grant the King a long and happy Life: and the Prince was so much
taken with the action, that he sent to the Treasury for a Sword, whereof the Handle, Scabard,
and Belt, were beset with precious stones, and presented him with it; and bestow'd on another
Page, who had help'd off with some of the Wine, another very rich Sword, and a great
Golden Cup. But the next day, he was so cast down, and so Melancholy, that Riding abroad
into the Country, he was not able to hold his Bridle. They put him into a better humour,
by getting from the Pages the best Sword and the Golden cup, giving them some Tumains in
ready Money.
                  The 19. of November,The Chancellor treats the Ambassadors. the Eahtemad Dowlet, or Chancellor, made a great Feast for the
Ambassadors, in a most fair Hall, which as soon as a man came to the entrance of it, wonderfully
charm'd the Eye. For in the midst of the Vestibulum, there was a great Fountain, out
of which came several spouts of water. The Hall it self had on the upper part of it, towards
the Roof,A Hall set all about with Looking- Glasses several Pourtractures of Women, cloath'd in several Modes, all done after some
Europaean Copies; and under them the Walls were set all about with Looking-Glasses, to the
number of above two hundred, of all sizes. So that when a manstood in the midst of the Hall,
he might see himself of all sides.
                  
                     
We were told, that in the King's Palace, in the appartment of his Wives, there is also a Hall,
done all about with Looking-Glasses, but far greater and much fairer than this. The entertainment
which the Chancellor made us was very Magnificent, all the meat being serv'd in silver
Dishes. We had the Divertisement of the King's Musick and Dancing-women all the time we
were at Dinner, during which they behav'd not themselves with the same respect and reserv'dness
as they had done in the King's presence, when we din'd at Court, but shew'd tricks much
beyond any thing they had done before, one whereof I observ'd, which I think almost Miraculous.
One of these Women having plac'd in the midst of the Hall a Vessel of Porcelane two
foot high, and taken several turns about it, took it up between her Leggs, with such slight, that
not any one of us perceiv'd it, and kept on the Dance with the same ease, and with the same
slight return'd it to the same place, not making one wrong step all the time.
                  These Women are calllled Kachbeha's,The Persian treatments have all Diversions and they are employ'd not only in this Divertisement,
but it any other that may be expected from Women. Those who entertain their Friends, what
quality soever they be of, will not have them want any Diversion they can desire; and the Persians,
who are great Lovers of Women, will not omit at their treatments that sport which they
most delight in. Whence it comes, that there is no great Feast made in Persia, at which these
Dancing-women are not brought in, as a necessary part of it. The Master of the Entertainment
proffers them to his Guests, and he who hath a mind to any one of them, rises from the Table,
goes into a private room with her whom he most fancies, and having done his work, comes to
his place again, and the Woman goes to the Dance, without any shame on the one side, or notice
taken of it on the other. Those who make some difficulty to venture themselves with such
common Ware, refuse the Master's kindness with a Complement, and thank him for the honour
he does them. There is but one City in all Persia, to wit, that of Ardebil, where this
custom is not suffered; which is done upon the accompt of the Sanctity of the place, which is so
great, that Schach-Abas thought himself oblig'd to banish thence all the publick VVomen.
                  Dinner being ended, the Musick and the Dancers withdrew, and the Ambassadors with the
Chancellor, made some Progress in their Negotiation, and in the mean time we were carried a
walking into the Garden, where they treated us with Fruit and Conserves.
                  As to this Eahtemad dowlet;The Chancellors name, age, and fortune. his name was Tagge, and he was about sixty years of age, having
one eye black, the other blew, a full face; but yellowish or inclining to an Olive, and very
high colour'd; whence it came, that he was ordinarily called Saru Tagge. He wore no
beard, as being an Eunuch; and upon that occasion we shall here give a short account of him
and his fortunes, which we think may deserve insertion in this place, though there are various
relations thereof.
                  Some affirm, that Saru Tagge, being yet very young, and his employment being to Copy
out Writings in the City of Keintze, he fell in love with a young Boy, and not prevailing with
him to consent to his brutality, he forc'd him. The Boy's Father made his complaints to
Schach-Abas, then King of Persia, who commanded that Saru Tagge should have his Syk, (so
they call the privy parts) with all its dependences, cut off. Others relate, that Schach-Ahas
condemn'd him to die, and that Tagge coming to hear of it, cut off, himself, those parts with a
Rasour, sent them to the King, with this request, that having himself punish'd the Members
which had offended, his Majesty would be pleas'd to let his head alone, which had done no
more harm, and might, one time or other, be serviceable to him; and that the King astonish'd
at the strange resolution of the man, conceiv'd an affection for him, and finding him an understanding
person, made him Secretary in his Court of Chancery. Schach-Sesi having with his
own hands kill'd Taleb-Chan, this man's Predecessor, sent Tagge the Golden Ink-horn, which
is the Badge of the Dignity of Chancellor.
                  The 21. following,A second conference with the Chancellor. the Chancellor invited the Ambassadors to a second entertainment, by
express order from the King, that they might make some further progress in their Affairs. They
had a very long conference together, after which we were treated at dinner, but not with the
same Magnificence as the time before.
                  The 29. the two Brothers, Seferas, and Elias-beg, came to visit the Ambassadors, who would
needs have them stay Dinner, Elias-beg endeavour'd all he could to be merry himself, and to
make others so, but we easily found it was done with some violence, and that his heart answer'd
not his outward demeanour. The reason of it we understood from his elder brother, who told
us, that the King had a great kindness for them, and did them very great favours; but that it
was a dangerous thing to jeast with him, and that he had a very sad assurance of it in his brother,
who being much respected at the Courr, for the freedom of his humour, and his divertive
conversation, the King told him one day, that he wanted not any thing, save that he was not
of the Mussulman's Religion, and that he could not do him a greater pleasure, than to suffer
Circumcision. Whereto Elias-beg, reply'd smiling, that that might happen one time or other,
intreating his Majesty not to speak any further of serious affairs, but to prosecute his Divertisements.
There was no more said to him of it for a good while, but upon occasion of the Clockmakers

constancy, the king sent him word, that he should remember the promise he had made
to be Circumcis'd. He would have excus'd himself, pretending what he had spoken was in
jeast; but those whom the king had sent to him, would not be shuffled off with that answer,
took him, and Circumcis'd him by force. Elias-beg confirm'd what his elder brother had told
us; but with this protestation, that he was nevertheless a Christian in his Soul, and that he
would die in the profession he had ever made of that Religion.
                  December the second,DECEM. Abasculi Beg, our Mehemandar, came, and brought us the Presents
from the king;The King's Presents to the Ambassadors. to wit, to each of the Ambassadors a Horse, with the Saddles cover'd all over
with plates of Gold, and the Bridles having great buckles of the same Metal: Two Garments,
according to the Persian wearing, together with the Mendils and Mianbends, that is, the Turbant
and Girdle, of Gold Brocado, according to the mode of the Countrey. Moreover, to be
divided between them both, two hundred and five pieces of fifteen sorts of silk stuffs, Satin,
Damask, Darai, Taffata, Cotton, &c. and two hundred Tumains in money, which amont to
just three thousand, three hundred and seventy Piastres, or a thousand French Pistols, towards
the expences of their travel in their return. The five principal persons of the Retinue had each of
them a Satin Vestment, and another of Taffata, with Flowers of Gold and Silk. The other
Gentlemen had each of them one of Taby, with Flowers of Gold; but the rest of the Retinue
had not any thing sent them. The Ambassador Brugman seiz'd the money, bestow'd some of it
among those of our Company, who stood in need thereof, to buy things necessary for their journey,
and distributed the rest among some of his Armenian friends.
                  The next day,The Ambassadors last treatment at Court. Decemb. 3. the King sent to invite the Ambassadors to Dine with him once
more, which was to be the last Treatment we were to have at Court. The Mahemandar told
them, it was the custom, that they should have, upon their own cloaths, the best of those Garments,
which the King had sent them. The Ambassadors, at first, made some difficulty to
have that complyance; but when they were told it was a custom observ'd by all Ambassadors,
and that no doubt the King would take it very ill at their hands, if they presented themselves before
him, without the marks of his Liberality, they at last resolv'd to do it, and, after their example,
all the rest of the Retinue. We Dined in the Hall of the Divan Chane, and all things
were performed with the same Ceremonies as at the first time. Only this happened more than
ordinary,The Chancellors Present to the King. that, while the fruits were yet upon the Table, the Chancellor ordered to pass before
the King, the Present, which he is wont to make every year once, and sometimes twice, for
reasons whereof we shall give some account hereafter. This Present consisted in twelve excellent
Horses, very richly cover'd, forty nine Camels loaden with Turkie Tapistry, and other
fine stuffs of Wool, fifteen Mules, a thousand Tumains, or fifty thousand Livers in money,
forty pieces of Gold and Silver Brocado, and several other stuffs and Commodities, whereof
there was such abundance, that it took up an hour and a half ere all were pass'd by, to be dispos'd
into the Treasury: in as much as for every Tumain, there was a several person, who carried
it in his hand, in a silken Purse of several colours.
                  After Dinner,The Ambassadors take leave of the King the Kurtzibachi, or Lord high Chamberlain, came and conducted the Ambassadors
to the King, of whom they took their leave. The King delivered them himself the
Answer he made to the Letters they had brought him, with recommendations to his Highness
our Master, and promis'd that he would send to Visit him by an express Embassy. The Ambassadors
answer'd the Complement, and thank'd the King for the honour he had done them, and
the noble Treatments they had received from him, during the stay they had made in his kingdom;
and return'd to their lodgings, observing the same order in their going from the Court
as had been done at their going thither.
                  Decemb. 4. the Poslanick,The Muscovian Poslanick dismiss'd. or Muscovian Ambassador, Alexei Savinowits went to see the
Chancellor, who dismiss'd him in the Kings name, that he might return in our Company. The
dayes following, those Lords, who had receiv'd any Presents from our Ambassadors, sent theirs
to them.
                  Decemb. 5. Chosru Sulthan sent the Ambassadors two orses.
                  The next day,The Presents from some Persian Lords to the Ambassadors. Tzanichan, the Kurtzibaschi, sent his Present to the Ambassadors; but in
regard he had done it, by the Persian fugitive, Rustan, who had so basely left the Ambassadors,
to change his Religion, they would not accept of it, and sent him word, that they much
wondred, that, it being, as they conceiv'd, his design to do them an honour, and to oblige
them by the Present he made them, he would send it by a person, for whom they must needs
have an aversion, and one they could not endure to see. Three dayes after, he sent them, by
another Man, two Horses, a Mule, and eighteen pieces of Stuff, which they accepted, and gave
the person who brought the Present, five Pistols.
                  
                     
The 10. the Chamberlian sent them two Horses; the Chancellor, two Horses, a
Mule, and forty five pieces of stuffs, among which there were several, whereof the groundwork
was Gold.
                  The same day, the Mehemander came to give us notice, that the King intended within eight
days to goe for Kaschan, and that if we could be ready against that time, we might make
our advantage of the convenience, as far as that City. Which oblig'd us to put all things in
readiness for our journey; and the 12. we made an entertainment, in order to our departure,
whereto were invited the same persons who had been at the first, save that the acquaintances,
which the Ambassador Brugman had made in the Suburbs of Tzulfa, occasion'd his invitation
of several Armenians to this, who had not been at the former
                  In the afternoon, there was running at the Ring, at which Divertisement was present also
the Portuguez Agent, who manag'd the Viceroy's affairs at the Court, and a rich Iew, who
drove a great trade between the Indies and Constantinople. The Walls, windows, and tops of
the neighbouring houses were full of Persians and Armenians, who came thither to see that
Divertisement.
                  The noise of the Trumpets and Tymbrels continu'd all the time,Brugmans imprudence. as did also that of our Artillery,
which the Ambassador Brugman ordered to be discharg'd at all the healths that were
drunk, and that so often, that Father Ioseph, our Interpreter, who knew that they might hear
every shot at the Kings Palace, fearing his Majesty should take it ill, was forc'd to represent
to him the Tyrannical humour of that Prince, and the danger, whereto he expos'd not only his
own person, after the Ambassadors were departed, but also all that belong'd to the Embassy.
He told him, that it was no extraordinary thing to see that Prince exercise his cruelties upon all
sorst of persons, without any regard of their Quality or Character, and intreated him to command
that there should be no more shooting. But all these Remonstrances prevail'd nothing
with the Ambassador, who ordered the Trumpets to sound, and the Gans to be fir'd as much
as at any time before. We understood since, that the King was so incens'd against the said Ambassador,
as well for this action, as another, whereof I shall presently give an account, that he
was upon the point of ordering him to be cut in pieces, and it may be all of us with him, if the
prudence and moderation of the Chancellor had not prevail'd with him to forbear, by representing
to him, that the Prince his Master, who, no doubt approv'd not the insolences of that Ambassador,
would be sure to punish them, as soon as he were advertised thereof.
                  But what most incens'd the King was this following adventure.One of the Gentlemen of the retie  takes Sanctu??ry Lion Bernoldi, who had the
Quality of a Gentleman, in the Retinue of the Ambassadors, was put into Irons by order of
the Ambassador Brugman; upon this account, that being born at Antwerp, whence he retir'd
into Holland, there were some jealousies conceiv'd of him, upon the frequent Visits he
made to the Dutch Agent, from whom he receiv'd many little kindnesses. However, that the
Agent might not take ought amiss, and the more to smother the jealousie had of him, it was
given out that he had rob'd the Ambassadors. He found means to make his escape, and cast himself
into the Sanctuary of the Persians, which they call Alla-Capi, which is part of the King's
Palace. The Ambassadors sent to intreat the King to return their Domestick into their hands;
but answer was brought, that if what he was charg'd to have stolen were found about him, it
should be restor'd, but that as to his person, it was not in his power to force him out of the
Sanctuary, though he had committed some Crime against his Royal Dignity. The Ambassador
Brugman was so transported with passion at this answer, that he said aloud, that he would have
him, and would kill him, though he took refuge and were found within the King's arms. Nay,
not content to betray this sally of his passion,Brugmans insolence. he suborn'd an Armenian, who was to perswade
Bernoldi, to get out of the Sanctuary in the night, and to hide himself some where else, while
he sent above twenty persons a-foot and on horse-back, Arm'd with Fire-locks, and Muskets
with match lighted, to the Palace-Gate, with express Order to kill him, if he came out, or to
get him thence by force. His Collegue endeavour'd all he could to prevent that violence, and
the Kings Guard oppos'd it; but the insolence of the party he had sent out upon this design, who
did more than they were commanded to do, was so great, that, making head against the Guard,
who would have thrust them back, the King awak'd at the noise, and, desirous to prevent further
disorder,The King's patience. commanded that Gate, through which there was an entrance into the Sanctuary,
to be shut, which was more than had been seen in the memory of Man; it being the deg
of the Foundation, that those unfortunate persons who are forc'd thither, should find
their way in at any hour.
                  The King was so incens'd at these proceedings, that as soon as he got up the next morning,
he told the Lords of his Councel, that being not safe, even within his own Palace, by reason
of the Germans, who would not suffer him to take his rest in the night, there was a necessity,
either he or they should leave the City.
                  
                     
The same Ambassador engag'd himself in another unhandsom business, which was of so much
the more dangerous consequence, that all the Christians of the Suburbs were concern'd in it.
The King commands every year, a search to be made among the Armenians, for all the handsom
Maids, and makes choice of those whom he likes best. Our Interpreter for the Armenian
Language, whose name was Seran, a person of a leud life, addressing himself to the Ambassador
Brugman, told him, that, in that search, he was like to lose a Daughter, a beautiful Lass,
whom he tenderly lov'd, and desir'd his advice and protection in that case. Brugman advis'd
him to oppose the Searchers, and to call to his assistance the Domesticks of the Embassy, and
assur'd him, they should be ready to relieve him. This proceedure of his, and several other imprudent
actions, had, at last, forc'd the King to a more severe resolution against the said Ambassador,
nay, haply against the whole Company, if the Chancellor had not moderated his
passion.
               
            
            
               
               THE
TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, TARTARY,
and PERSIA.
               The Sixth Book.
               ERE we leave the City of Ispahan, which is now the Metropolis of the whole
Kingdom of Persia, it will not be amiss, I gave the Reader an account of
what I found therein, worthy my Observation, during our aboad there, for
the space of five moneths, and to give here such a Description thereof, as he
must expect to be so much the more full and particular, inasmuch as there is
not any Author, who hath hitherto written of it, hath done it with exactness
enough, to satisfie, even, a mean Curiosity.
               They say,Ispahan described??? that the City of Ispahan is the same which was heretofore called Hecatonopolis, and
that before Tamberlane's time, it was known by the name of Sipahan, as well by reason of the
number of its inhabitants, which was so great as that, out of it, a considerable Army might
be rais'd, as in regard that, in that place, the Armies had their Rendezvous; from the antient
Persian and Vsbeque word, Sipe, whereof Sipahan is the plural, and signifies the same thing as
Lsker, that is to say, an Army: from which is derived the word Sipes-alar, a term the Persians
do yet sometimes make use of, to signifie a chief Commander, or General of an Army.
Tamberlane was the first, who, by transporting the two first Letters of that name, call'd it Ispahan.
Ahmed ben Arebscha, who hath written the Life and Actions of Tamberlane, calls
this City in all places, Isbahan, writing the word with a b, and the Modern Persians always
write it Isfahan, with an f, from an Arabian word, which signifies Rank or Batallion, though
they pronounce it indifferently, sometimes Isfahan, sometimes Ispahan. Ios. Barvaro alwayes
calls it Spaham; and Ambr. Contarini, who was sent Ambassador from the Republick of Venice,
to Vssum Cassan, King of Persia, in the year 1473. calls it Spaa, Spaam, and Aspacham.
But as we said before, its right name is Ispahan.
               This City lies in the Province of Erak, or Hierack, which is the antient Parthia, in a spacious
Plain, having on all sides, at about three or four Leagues distance, a high Mountain,
which compasses it like an Amphitheatre, at thirty two degrees, twenty six minutes Latitude,
and eighty six degrees, forty minutes, Longitude; and I have observ'd, that the Needle declined
there seventeen degrees from the North towards the West. It hath, toward the South and
South-west side, the Mountain of Demawend; and on the North-east side, towards the Province

of Mesanderan, the Mountain of Ieilak-Perjan. The Author of the French Book, intituled
Les Estats & Empires, puts it in the Province of Chuaressen: but he is mistaken, for
Chuaressen is a Province of the Vsbeques Tartars. at 43. degrees Latitude, and lies at a great distance
from that of Erak.
               If you take in all its Suburbs,Its greatness. it will be found that it is above eight German Leagues in compass,
in so much that it is as much as a man can do to go about it in one day. The City hath
twelve Gates, whereof there are but nine open; above eighteen thousand Houses, and about
five hundred thousand Inhabitants. The Walls of it are of Earth, low and weak, being, below,
two fathoms, and above, but a foot thick, and its Bastions are of Brick, but so poorly flanked,
that they do not any way fortifie the City, no more than does the Ditch, which is so ruin'd, that
both Summer and Winter, a man may pass over it dry-foot. F. Bizarro, and some others
affirm, that the walls are of Chalk; but I could find no such thing, unless it were that in the
Castle, which hath its walls distinct from those of the City, there are some places, which look
as if they were whitened, or done over with Chalk or Lime.
               The River Senderut,The River Senderut. which rises out of the adjacent Mountain of Demawend, runs by its
walls on the South and South-west side, on which side is the Suburbs of Tzulfa. Before it
comes into the City, it is divided into two branches, one whereof falls into the Park, called
Hasartzerib, where the King keeps all sorts of Deer, and from the other, there is drawn a current
of water, which passes, by Chanels under ground, into the Garden of Tzarbagh. This
River supplies the whole City with water, there being hardly a house into which it comes not
by Pipes, or so near, as that it is no great trouble to them to fill their Cisterns of it, which they
call Haws and Burke; though besides this convenience of the River, they have Wells, the water
whereof is as good as that of the River. Allawerdi-Chan, sometime Governour of Schiras,
built, at his own charge, the fair Stone-Bridge, which is between the Garden of Tzarbagh,
and the City, upon this River, which is as broad in that place as the Thames is at
London.
               Schach-Abas had a design to bring into the River of Senderut that of Abkuren which rises
on the other side of the same Mountain of Demawend; and whereas, to bring these two Rivers
into the same Chanel, there was a necessity of cutting the Mountain, he employ'd, for the
space of fourteen years together, above a thousand Pioners at that work. And though they met
with extraordinary difficulties, not only in that they had to do with pure Rock, which in some
places was above two hundred foot deep; but also in regard, the Mountain being cover'd with
Snow for near nine Months of the year, they had but three to work in, yet had he the work
constantly carried on with such earnestness, that all the Chans and Great Lords sending their
Work-men thereto, upon their own charges, there was in a manner to doubt made of the successe
of that great enterprize, since there remain'd to do but the space of two hundred paces, when
Schach-Abas died, leaving the Consummation of that imperfect work to his Successor, who
hath as yet done nothing therein.
               If Aaly, the Patron and great Saint of the Persians, had liv'd in that time, he might have
done Schach-Abas a very great kindness, by opening that Rock at one blow with his Sword,
and so made way for the River, as he sometime did, according to the Relations of the Persians,
in the Province of Karabach, where he made a passage for the River Aras, through the Mountain,
which he opened with his Sword, and which, upon that occasion, is, to this day, called
Aaly deressi, that is, the streights of Aaly.
               The City of Ispahan was twice destroy'd by Tamberlane;Ispahan destroy'd by Tamberlane. once, when he took it from the
King of Persia; and the other, when the said City would have revolted from him, and become
Subject to its lawfull Prince. Ios. Barbaro, who Travell'd into Persia in the year 1471. sayes,
that about twenty years before, Chotza, whom he calls Giausa, King of Persia, desirous to punish
this City for its Rebellion, commanded his Soldiers not to come thence, unless they
brought with them the Heads of some of the Inhabitants of Ispahan; and that the Soldiers,
who met not every day with Men, cut off Womens heads, shav'd them, and so brought them
to Chotza, and that by this means the City was so depopulated, that there were not people
enough left to fill the sixth part of it. It began to recover it self under Schach-Isinael 11. but indeed,
it was Schach-Abas, by translating the seat of his Empire from Caswin to this City,
brought it to the height it is now in, not only by adorning it with many fair, both publick
and private Structures, but also by peopling it with a great number of Families, which he
brought along with him out of several other Provinces of the kingdome.
               But what contributes most to the greatness of this City is the Metschids, or their Mosqueies,
the Market-places, the Basar, the publick Baths, and the Palaces of Great Lords that
have some relation to the Court; but especially the fair Gardens, whereof there is so great
a number, that there are many Houses have two or three, and hardly any, but hath at least
one.
               The expences the Persians are at in their Gardens,Its Gardens. is that wherein they make greatest ostentation
of their Wealth. Not that they much mind the furnishing of them with delightful

Flowers, as we do in Europe; but these they slight as an excessive Liberality of Nature, by
whom their common fields are strew'd with an infinite number of Tulips and other Flowers; but
they are rather desirous to have their Gardens full of all sorts of Fruit-Trees, and especially to
dispose them into pleasant Walks, of a kind of Plane or Poplar, a Tree not known in Europe,
which the Persians call Tzinnar. These Trees grow up to the height of the Pine, and have very
broad Leaves, not much unlike those of the Vine. Their fruit hath some resemblance to the
Chestnut, while the outer coat is about it; but there is no Kernel within it, so that it is not
to be eaten. The wood thereof is very brown, and full of Veins, and the Persians use it in
Doors, and shutters for Windows, which, being rubb'd with Oyl, look incomparably better
than any thing made of Wall-nut Tree, nay indeed than the Root, of it, which is now so much
esteem'd.
               All things in their Gardens are very delightful,Its Fountains. but, above all, their Fountains. The Basins
or Receptacles of them are very large, and most of Marble, or Free-stone. There are belonging
to them many Chanels, of the same stone, which conveigh the water from one Basin to another,
and serve to water the Garden. Persons of Quality, nay indeed many rich Merchants,
build, in their Gardens, Summer-houses, or a kind of Gallery or Hall, which is enclos'd
with a row of Pillars, whereto they add, at the four corners of the main Structure, so many
with-drawing-rooms, or Pavilions, where they take the air, according to the wind then reigning.
And this they take so much delight in, that, many times, these Summer-houses, are handsomer
built, and better furnish'd, than those wherein they ordinarily live. 'Tis true, their
Great-mens Houses and Palaces are very Magnificent within; but there is not any thing so
ugly without, in regard most of their Houses are built only of Earth, or Brick, bak'd in the
Sun.
               Their houses are in a manner square,Their Houses. and most have four stories, accounting the ground-room
for one, They call the Cellar, and such places, belonging to a house, as are under ground,
Sirsemin, the ground-rooms of the house, Chane, the first story Kuschk; the second, Tzauffe;
and the third, Kesser; and they call the open Halls Eiwan. Their Windows are commonly as
big as their Doors; and in regard their buildings are not very high, the frames ordinarily reach
up to the Roof. They have not yet the use of Glass, but, in Winter, they cover the frames of
their Windows, which are made like Lattices, with oyl'd Paper.
               There is also little Wood in Persia,Their stoves??? I mean in most of its Provinces, that, not being able to
keep any great fire, they make use of Stoves, but they are otherwise made than those of Germany.
In the midst of their low rooms, they make a hole in the ground of about the compass of
an ordinary Kettle, which they fill with burning Coals or Char-coal, and put over it a plank,
or little low Table, cover'd with a large Carpet. Sitting, according to their custom, upon the
ground, they thrust their feet under the Table, and draw the Carpet over their Body up to the
breast, so as that the heat is thereby kept in. Some pass away the nights also, thus accommodated,
and so they procure a very natural heat with little fire, and they imagine it to be the
more wholsom, in that it troubles not the head, which in the mean time hath the benefit of a
fresh and healthy air. They call this kind of Stoves Tenuer; and that the brain might not be
offended by Vapours, which Char-coal commonly sends up into the head, they have certain
Passages and Conduits under ground, through which the air draws them away. Persons of mean
Quality, and such as are saving, dress their meat with these Tenuers, and make use of them instead
of an Oven, and bake Bread and Cakes over them. There is not a house in Ispahan, but
hath its Court, which a man must cross ere he comes into the house.
               They say,The streets??? that heretofore, the streets of Ispahan were so broad, that twenty horse might
have rid a-breast in any of them. But now, especially since the City began to be re-peopled, in
the time of Schach-Abas, they husbanded their ground better, especially in the heart of the
City, near the Maidan and the Basar; insomuch that the streets are become so narrow, that
if a man meets a Mule-driver, whom they call Charbende, that is, a servant to look to the Asses,
who many times drives twenty Mules or more before him, he must step into some shop, and
stay there till they be all pass'd by. All the streets abutting upon the Maidan are very narrow:
but the Maidan, or Market-place, though it hath shops all about it, is so large, that I
cannot imagine there is any in Europe comes near it.
               This Market-place is seven hundred foot long,The Maida
                   and two hundred and fifty broad. All the
houses about the Maidan are of equal heighth, and all built of Brick, having their shops
vaulted: where you have, on the side towards the King's Palace, Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, and
Druggists; and opposite to them, those Merchants who sell all sorts of stuffs, of Silk, Wool,
and Cotton, and the Taverns where they Tiple, and sell all sorts of Provisions. All these houses
are two stories high, and have all, their Eiwans, or open Halls. The Market-place is
planted all about with a kind of Trees, called Scimscad, which is somewhat like Box, but
they are much higher, and the branches being perpetually green, they are so cut, that the
Shops are to be seen between the Trees, and make a very delightful Prospect. But it is not one
of the least Ornaments of their Maidan, that the Rivlet which runs at the foot of these

Trees, in a Chanel of Freestone, rais'd two foot from the ground all about the Market-place,
falls into two great Basons, at the two corners of it, and is thence carried by Chanels under
ground to other places.
               Trades-men do not work at all themselves, but have their Slaves and Apprentices, who do
all the main work at their house's, while the Master's business is only to sell his Commodities,
in shops appointed for that purpose, at the Maidan, in a great Vaulted Gallery built with
Arches, or in the streets abutting upon it, where every Trade hath its particular quarter assign'd
it, or haply in a street appointed for that particular Commodity, and where they permit
not the selling of any other. The observance of which order, in regard the Persians are very
neat in all they do, makes so delightful a shew, that I have not seen any thing like it. At the
end of his Gallery, there are two Balconies, cover'd over head, opposite one to the other,
where their Musick, which consists in Tymbrels, Hawboyes, and other kind of Instruments,
which they call Kerenei, is to be heard every night at Sun-set, as also, when the King, either
going out of the City, or coming into it, passes through the Maidan. They have this kind
of Musick in all the Cities of Persia, which are governed by the Chan, and they say
Tamberlane first introduc'd that custom, which hath been observed ever since.
               The King's Palace is upon the Maidan. The Persians call it Dowlet-Chane, or Der Chane Schach,
and there lie before the Gate several great Pieces,The King's Palace. of all sizes, but most such as require 36 or
48 pound Bullet, very roughly cast, without Carriages, and lying upon Beams, so as that no
use can be made of them. Nicholas Hem, a Hollander, who travell'd into Persia in the years
1623. and 1624. says that these Pieces were brought thither from Ormus, and that they secure
the Avenues of the place; but, as I said before, it is impossible they should be discharg'd.
Nay, the Palace it self hath no Fortifications, and is compass'd only by a high Wall. In the
day time, there are but three or four upon the Guard, and in the night, there are fifteen at
the Gate, and about thirty within the King's apartment. These last are all persons of Quality,
and sons of Chans,His Guard, of whom, some stand Centry, and the rest walk the Round, and they all
lye upon the ground, in the open air. This Guard hath its Kischiktzi, or particular Captain,
who, every night, delivers the King a List of their names who are upon the Guard, that he may
know whom he may confide in, and by what persons he is served.
               Over the first Gate, there is a great square structure, which hath large Windows on all
sides, and we were told, that, within, it was Carv'd all over and Gilt: The other principal
apartments of this great Palace, are, the Tab Chane, which is a spacious Hall, where the King
treats all the great Lords of his Court, and entertains them at Dinner, upon the day of their
Naurus, which is their first day of the year; the Divan-Chane, which is the ordinary place
where all Appeals are try'd, and where the King commonly gives Audience to the Ambassadors
of Forein Princes, as we said elsewhere; which is done, partly upon this account, that, this
Edifice having a great Court adjoyning to it, into which it looks, the King may have the convenience
of shewing the Ambassadors some of his best Horses, and his other pieces of Magnificence,
as he did at our first audience. The Haram-Chane, which is a Hall, wherein the Casseha,
that is the King's Concubines, who are always shut up in several apartments, have their
meetings, to Dance before him, and to divert him with their Musicians, who are all Eunuchs:
The Deka, or the place of the King's ordinary residence; where he lodges, and cats, with his
lawful Wives. All these Halls have, belonging to them, several Chambers, Closets, Galleries,
and other necessary apartments, fit for the lodging and divertisement of so powerful a Prince,
and so great a number of Ladies, who are all with him within the same Palace; wherein
there is not any considerable apartment, but hath its particular Garden.
               At the entrance of the Kings Palace, and about forty paces from the outer-gate, on the right
hand, there is another Gate, which opens into a spacious Garden, in the midst whereof there
is a Chapel which gives a Privilege to the whole place, and makes the Sanctuary we spoke of
before,The Sanctuary. called by the Persians, Alla-Capi, that is, God's Gate. All those who stand in fear
of imprisonment, whether upon a civil, or criminal account, find here an assured Sanctuary and
refuge, even against the King's displeasure, and may live there till they are reconcil'd to their
Adversaries, if they have to do with private men, or obtain'd their pardon of the King; provided
they have wherewithall to subsist. Murtherers and Assassins participate of the same Privilege;
but the Persians have so great an aversion for Theft, as accounting it a base and infamous
Crime, as it really is, that they permit not Thieves, if they do come in, to stay there many
days. At the time of our Travels, we found, in this Sanctuary, a Sulthan, who having, either
through misfortune, or his own ill conduct, lost the Kings favour, and being in fear of losing
his life, was got in thither with all his Family, and liv'd in Tents, which he had set up in
the Garden.
               Behind the Kings Palace, lies the Castle, which they call Taberik Kale. It serves for a Citadel,Its Citadel.
which is the signification of the word Kale, and it is fortify'd with a Rampier, and several
Bastions of earth, which being very sharp above, Nicholas Hem, whom I have found in
all things else the most exact of any that have written of the City of Isphan, took them for Towers.

The King doe's not live in it, but there is a Governour, who hath the command of it, and
a strong Garrison within it, which is kept there for the security of the Treasure, the Arms and
Ammunition of War, that are within it; though all the Artillery consists only in some Fieldpieces.
               On the other side of the Maidan,Another Sanctuary in a by-street, there is another Sanctuary, which is called
Tschehil Sutun. upon occasion of the forty Beams, which under-prop the Roof of the
Structure, and which all rest upon one Pillar, which stands in the middle of the Metschid, or
Mosquey. Into this Sanctuary, there got a great number of the Inhabitants of Ispahan, when
Tamberlane punish'd the rebellion of this City. For though he had no great Sentiments of piety,
yet did he discover a certain respect for the places he accounted sacred; and accordingly he
spar'd all those who took refuge in the Mosquey, but ordered all the rest to be cut in pieces, and
commanded the Walls of the Court belonging to it, to be pull'd down. But Schach-Ismael had
them built up again, and made the place a Sanctuary.
               Towards the South part of the Maidan stands that rich and magnificent Mosquey,Te chief Mosquey of the City??? which
Schach-Abas began, and was almost finish'd when he died, but Schach-Sefi had the work carried
on at the time of our being there, causing the Walls to be done over with Marble. It is dedicated
to Mehedi, who is the twelfth Iman, or Saint, of the posterity of Aaly, for whom Schach-Abas
had so particular a Devotion, that he was pleas'd to build several other Mosqueys after
the same Model, though much less, at Tauris, and other places, in honour of the same Saint,
wherein he made use of the Marble, which he had brought from Eruan, which is as white as
Chaulk, and smoother than any Looking-glass. But the Marble which was spent in the building
of the great Metschid, at Ispahan, is brought from the Mountain of Elwend. The Persians
would have it believ'd, that Mehedi is not dead, but lies hid in a Grot, near Kufa, and that he
shall come out thence, some time before the day of Judgement, and ride Duldul, Aaly's Horse,
upon whom he is to go all over the World, to convert people to the Religion of Mahomet.
Whence this Mosquey is called Metzid Mehede Sahebeseman.
               To go from the Maidan to this Mosquey, a man must pass through a great Court, pav'd with
Free-stone, at the end whereof, there is, under a Tree, a fair Cistern, wherein those, who go
to do their Devotions in the Mosquey, wash and purifie themselves. Behind this Tree, there is
a pair of stairs, by which you go up to the square place, which is much less than the fore-said
Court, and thence it is but a little further to the Mosquey. Iohn de Laet, taking it from Nicholas
Hem, affirms, that there is a pair of stairs of thirteen steps to get up to the Mosquey, and that
those stairs are cut out of one piece of Mare; but there is no such thing. The Portal is of
white Marble, and at least as high as that of the Meschaick Choabende, in Sulthania. The door
is cover'd all over with plates of Silver, which are Gilt in several places.
               As you pass through the Door, you enter into a great Court, round about which there is
a Vaulted Gallery, and, in the middle of it, a great Cistern of Free-stone, but eight square,
and full of water. Above this Gallery there is another, not so high as this, which upper Gallery
hath, towards the Hejat, or Court, a row of Marble Pillars, which in some places are
Gilt. A man must cross this Court to go into the Mosquey, wherein are the Meherab and the
Cathib, that is, the Altar and the Pulpit, according to their way. As you come in, you pass
under a Vault of extraordinary height, done over with glittering Stones, some Blew, some
Gilt. It is a vast Structure, having many Neeches and Chapels, which are all upheld by Marble
Pillars. But the most remarkable thing in all this Emerat, is, that all the Walls, as well
those of the Gallery, which is in the Court, as of the Mosquey it self, are of Marble, about fifteen
or sixteen foot high, and that there is no piece of Marble, (which is most of it white and
extremely well polish'd) but is five or six foot in length and breadth, and they are so neatly
put one into another, that, the Junctures being in a manner imperceptible, a man cannot but
admire the Art of the Work-man, and acknowledge that the Workmanship is not to be imitated.
The Meherab, or the Altar, is all of one piece of Marble, having on each side, a Pillar of
the same stone, which is also all of one piece. Besides this Mosquey, which is the chiefest in all
the City, and the most sumptuous of any in the whole Kingdome, there are in Ispahan many
others, but they are much less, and there is too great a number of them, for us to undertake to
give here a more particular Description thereof.
               In the midst of the Maidan there stands a high Pole,The Exercises of the Grandes. much after the manner of those that are
set up in several Cities of Europe, to shoot at the Parrat, but, instead of a Bird, they set on the
top of it a little Melon, an Arpus, or an Apple, or haply a Trencher, with money upon it; and
they alwayes shoot at it on Horse-back, and that Riding in full speed.
               The King himself is sometimes pleas'd to make one, among the Inhabitants, when they are
at that sport, or sends some of his chiefest Lords to do it; and commonly, there are very considerable
summs layd. The Money which falls down with the rencher, belongs to the King's
foot-men, and he who carries away the Prize, is oblig'd to make a Feast for all the Company;
nay for the King himself, if so be he hath shot among them. They play there also at a certain
Game, which the Persians call Kuitskaukan, which is a kind of Mall, or Cricket; but they play

at this also on Horse-back, and strike the Bowl to the end, Riding in full speed. They also
often Exercise themselves at the Tzirid, or Iavelin; their way we have described elsewhere.
And in regard Persia hath the best Horses of any in the World, and that the Persians are very
curious about them, they many times lay wagers on their swiftness, and Ride them between the
two Pillars, which are at both ends of the Maidan. When the King is onely a Spectator
of the sport, he sits in a little wooden Lodge, called Scanescin, which is at one end of
the Maidan; set on four Wheels, for the more convenient removal of it from one place to
another.
               On the other side of the Maidan,Taverns. over against the great Mosquey, are the Wine-Taverns,
and other Drinking-Houses, whereof we spoke before. There are several kinds of them. In the
Scire Chanes, they sell Wine; but those who have the least tenderness for their Reputation,
will not come into those places, which are infamous, and the common receptacles of a sort of
people, who divert themselves there with Musick, and the Dancing of some of their common
Drabbs, who having, by their obscene gestures, excited the brutalities of the Spectators,
get them into some corner of the House, or draw them along into some publick places, where
they permit the commission of these abhominations, as freely as they do that of ordinary
sins.
               In the Tsal Chattai Chane,Places where The is drunk. they drink The, or Tea, which the Persians call Tzai, though the
Tzai,  Cha are properly but a kind of The, and Chattai, in as much as it is bought them
from Chattai: we shall have occasion to speak more of it hereafter. They are only persons of
good repute who Drink of this,Chesse. and frequent these Houses, where, in the intervals of their
drinking, they spend the time at a certain Game somewhat like our Tick-Tack. but they commonly
play at Chesse, at which they are excellent, and go beyond the Muscovites, whom I
dare affirm to be the best Gamesters at Chesse of any in Europe. The Persians call this Game
Sedrentz, that is, Hundred-cares, in regard those who play at it, are to apple all their thoughts
thereto; and they are great Lovers of it, in as much as from the word Schch, whence it hath
its name, they would have it believ'd, it is of their Invention. Some years since, there was
publish'd in Germany, a great Volume, upon the Game of Chesse, wherein the Author, too
easily crediting Olaus Magnus, would have it believ'd, that the antient Goths and Swedes, put
those to play at Chesse who were Suters to their Daughters, that, by their management of that
Game, which hath no dependence on Fortune, they might discover the judgement and disposition
of their pretended Sons in Law. But these are only Fables, as is also what is related of one
Elmaradab, King of Babylon. The Government of this Prince was so Tyrannical, as the story
at least would have it, that no Body thinking it safe, to represent to him the dangers, whereto
his cruelties expos'd the State and his own Person, one of the Lords of his Council, named Philometer,
invented the Game of Chesse, which, instead of openly opposing the sentiments of the
Tyrant, discover'd to him the duty of a Prince towards his Family and Subjects, by shewing
him the removals of the several pieces, by the representation of two Kings, encamp'd one
against the other, with their Queens, their Officers and Soldiers; and that this wrought a
greater impression on the King, than all the other remonstrances that could have been made to
him.
               The Cahwa Chane are those places,Places for Tobacco and Cahwa, or Coffee. where they take Tobacco, and drink of a certain black
water, which they call Cahwa: but we shall treat of both hereafter in this very Book, when
we shall have occasion to speak of the Persians manner of Life. Their Poes and Historians are
great frequenters of these places, and contribute much to the Divertisement of the Company.
These are seated in a high Chair, in the midst of the Hall, whence they entertain their Auditors
with Speeches, and tell them Satyrical stories, playing in the mean time with a little stick,
with the same gestures, and after the same manner, as those do who shew tricks of Legerdemain
among us.
               Near these Taverns or Drinking-Houses,Barbars and Surgeous. are the shops of Surgeons and Barbers, between
which Trades there is a great difference in Persia, as there is, within these few years, in France.
The former, whom they call Tzerrach, only dress Wounds and Hurts; and the others, named
Dellak, only Trim, unless they sometimes are employ'd about Circumcision. These Barbers
are much taken up, for there is not a man, but is shav'd, as soon as any Hair begins to appear;
but there is not, on the other side, any who carries not his Rasour about him, for fear
of getting the Pox, which they are extremely afraid of, because it is very common among
them, and very contagious.
               As you go out of the Maidan,The Basar. on the same side, and turning on the right hand, you come to
the Basar, or true Market-place, and, in the midst of the Market-place, the Kserie, or kind
of open Cloister, where are sold all the richest Stuffs and Commodities that the Kingdome
affords. Over the Gate of this Structure, there is a striking-Clock, made by an English-man
named Festy, in the time of Schacst-Abas: and in regard, that then there were few Lords that
had Watches, the Persians look'd on the Motions of that work as a thing Miraculous and
Supernatural. This English Clock-maker had met with the same fate as Rodolf Stadler, and had

been cut to pieces by the friends of a Persian, whom he had kill'd, and the Clock had been out
of Order ever since his Death.
               This Market-place consists of several Streets, cover'd over head, and is so full of Shops, and
those shops so full of all sorts of Merchandizes, that there is nothing, though ever so rare in
World, which is not to be had here, and at a very reasonable rare. For indeed, there is nothing
dear at Ispahan, but Wood and Provision, inasmuch as there is no Forrest near it, nor
Meadows for the feeding of Cattel.
               Of all the shops I saw at Ispahan, I was not pleas'd so much with any as that of a Druggist,
who liv'd in the Maidan, on the left hand as you go to the Metzid, by reason of the abundance
of the rarest Herbs, Seeds, Roots and Minerals it was furnish'd with. The Root Tzinae,
or Chinae, which the Persians call Bich Tzini, and Rhubarb, which they call Rawentzini, and
is brought thither from China and great Tartary, were not worth here above three Abas's, or
a Crown the pound.
               There is not any Nation in all Asia, nor indeed almost of Europe, who sends not its Merchants
to Ispahan,Ispahan a place of great trade whereof some sell by Whole-sale, and others by Retail, by the Pound and
the Ell. There are ordinarily above twelve thousand Indians in the City, who have, most of
them, their shops near those of the Persians, in the Maidan, and their Merchandizes, in the
Caravanseras, where they have their Habitations, and their Store-Houses. Their Stuffs are incomparably
fairer, and their Commodities of greater Value than those of Persia; inasmuch
as besides the Musk and Amber-grease; they bring thither great quantities of Pearls and Diamonds.
I observ'd, that most of these Indosthans, had upon the Nose, a mark of Saffron, about
the breadth of a Man's finger; but I could never learn what that Mystery signify'd. They
are all Mahumetans or Pagans: they burn the bodies of their Deceas'd friends and kinred, and
in that ceremony they use only the Wood of the Mesch-Mesch, or Apricock-Tree. But of
these a particular account will be given in the Travels of Mandelslo into the Indies. Besides these
Indians, there is, at Ispahan. a great number of Tartars, from the Provinces of Chuaressem,
Chattai and Buchar, Turks, Iews, Armenians, Georgians, English, Dutch, French, Italians and
Spaniards.
               The City is supply'd with Provisions out of the other Provinces of the Kingdom. Out of that
of Kirman, there are brought, in the Winter time, fat Sheep, and, in Summer, Lambs, which
are sold at Ispahan, at nine or ten Abas's a piece: for the very Skin is worth five or six, upon
the account of the Furr, which is very pretious there. The Province of Kilan furnishes it with
Rice; and those of the Kendeman, Tasum, Ebarku, and Ieschi, though they lie at a great distance,
with Wheat and Barly. Wood and Charcoal are sold here, by the pound, the Wood
near a half peny, and the Charcoal a peny the pound, in regard they are forc'd to bring it from
Mesanderan, and Ieilak-Perjan.
               The ordinary Money of Persia is of Silver and Brasse, very little of Gold. The Abas, the
Garem-Abas,The Persian money??? or half-Abas, which they commonly call Chodabende, the Scahi and Bisti, are
of Silver. The former were so called from Schach-Abas, by whose command they were first
made, being in Value about the third part of a Rixdollar; so that they are about 18 d. sterl.
though they do not amount, by weight, to above 15 d. Schach-Chodabende gave his name to
the half-Abas. The Scahi are worth about the fourth part of an Abas, and two Bisti and a
half make a Scahi. Schach-Ismael had Coined, in his time, a kind of Money, which was
called Lari, and it was made after the manner of a thick Latin wire, flatted in the middle, to
receive the impression of the Characters, which shew'd the value of the piece. The Persians
call all sorts of Copper or Brass money Pul, but there is one particular kind thereof, which
they call Kasbeki, whereof forty make an Abas. When they are to name great Sums, they
account by Tumains, each whereof is worth fifty Abas's. Not that there is any piece of Money
amounting to that Sum, but the term is only us'd for the convenience of accounting, as in
Muscovy, they account by Roubles, and in Flanders by thousands of Livers. They will receive
from Foreiners no other money than Rixdollars or Spanish Ryals, which they immediately
convert into Abas's, and gain a fourth part by the money. The King of Persia farms out
the Mint to private persons, who gain most by it, and share stakes with the money-changers,
whom they call Xeraffi, who have their shops, or Offices, in the Maidan, and are oblig'd to
bring all forein money to the publick-Mint, which they call Serab-chane.
               There is this remarkable as to the brass money, that every City hath its particular money
and mark,Their brass money. which is changed every year, and that such money goes only in the place where it
was made. So that upon their first day of the year, which begins with the Vernal Equinox,
all the brass-money is cry'd down, and the mark of it is chang'd. The ordinary mark of it is
a Stag, a Deer, a Goat, a Satyre, a Fish, a Serpent, or some such thing. At the time of our
Travels, the Kasbeki were mark'd, at Ispahan, with a Lion, at Scamachie, with a Devil, at
Kaschan, with a Cock, and in Kilan, with a Fish. The King of Persia, on the one side, makes
a great advantage by this brass-money, in as much as he pays for a pound of this Metal, but
an abas, which amounts to about eighteen pence, and he hath made of it sixty four Kasbeki;

and, on the other, he, by this means, keeps the Kingdom from being too full of uncurrent and
cry'd down money.
               The great Trade of the City of Ispahan hath oblig'd the King to build there a great number of
Caravanseras.Caravanseras or publick Inns. These are spacious Store-houses, built four-square, and enclos'd of all sides
with a high Wall, for the security of forein Merchants, who have their lodgings in them, as
also for that of the Commodities they bring thither. They are two or three stories high, and
have, within, many conveniences, Courts, Chambers, Halls, and Galleries.
               Among other publick Structures, we may well take notice of the two Monasteries of Italian
and Spanish Monks, which are in the most Northerly quarter of the City, and about a thousand
paces distant one from the other, One is the Convent of the Augustine Monks, whereof we
have spoken before; but the other is inhabited by certain Carmelites, who are Italians, and
though they were but ten in all, yet I may boldly affirm, that those of this Order have not a
nobler Convent in any part of Europe. Their Prior's name was F. Tinas, and he was, at our being
there, very antient, a good man, and of a free disposition, as were also the other Monks;
who live among the Infidels much more orderly than they do elsewhere. We are oblig'd to acknowledge
their civilities, especially those among us, who, having the advantage of the Latine
tongue, could converse with them. We never visited them but they treated us with a Collation,
and dismiss'd us extremely oblig'd to them for their kindness, as in other things, so particularly,
in the instructions they gave us how we ought to behave our selves during our aboad in
Persia. They presented M. Hicrome Imhof, a Senator of Nuremberg, and one of the chief Gentlemen
belonging to the Embassy, (who is now in Germany, in a Court much different from
that of Schach-Sefi) with a very fair Italian and Persian Lexicon, which he promises to publish,
with the Latine, since by him added to the other two Languages. They did me, in particular,
the favour, to afford me refuge in their Convent, to protect me against the persecutions of
the Ambassador Brugman, and to get my Letters convey'd into Germany with much safety and
speed.
               At the time of our being there, they were also beginning to build a Convent for certain
French Capucis,French Capucius. who had bought a place, for that end, within a quarter of a League of the
Monastery of the Angustines. They were but three in all, who seem'd to be very good people,
and had attain'd some learning. They had finish'd the Chapel, and were then upon the Dormitory,
which had adjoyning to it a Kitchin-Garden, and a Vineyard, with much likelyhood
they would not give over building with that.
               Between this last Monastery,The King's stables. and that of the Carmelites, are the King's stables, near which
there is a pretty high Tower, which is all built of Earth, and the Horns of Stags and Au's.
They say, that Schach-Tamas I. having kill'd two thousand of those beasts at one Hunting, employ'd
their Horns in that building, in memory of so remarkable a defeat, and that he therewith
made that Tower which they call Keleminar.
               The parts adjacent to the City,His Garden. are not unsuitable to the sumptuousness of its Structures, and
the greatness of so famous a Metropolis. The King's Garden, which they call Tzarbagh, is,
no doubt one of the noblest in all the World. It is above half a League in a perfect square, and
the River Senderut, which hath spacious Walks on both sides of it, divides it into a cross, so as
that it seems to make four Gardens of it. At one of its extremities, towards the South, there
is a little Mountain, divided into several Alleys, which have on both sides steep Precipices, in
regard that the River, which they have brought up to the top of the Mountain, does thence
continually fall down, by Chanels, into Basins, which are cut within the Rock. The Chanels
were about three foot broad; and were cut upon every side, so as that the water falling directly
down, and, with a great noise into the Basin, extremely delighted both the ear, and the eye.
No Basin but the water fell into it, and upon every Alley, there was a Basin of white Marble,
which forc'd the water into divers figures. All the water about the Garden fell at last into a
Pond, which in the midst of it, cast up water forty foot high. This Pond, had, at the four
corners of it so many large Pavilions, whereof the appartments were gilt within, and done
with fueillage, there being a passage from one to another by Walks, planted with Tzinnar-Trees,
whereof there being Millions, they made the place the most pleasant and delightfull of
any in the World.
               The Fruit-Trees are not to be numbred,Fruit-Trees. and there are of all sorts, which Schach-Abas, who
began this Garden, had sent for, not only out of all the Provinces of the Kingdom, but also out
of Turkie and the Indies. Here you have all sorts of Apples, Pears, Almonds, Apricocks,
Peaches, Pomegranates, Citrons, Orenges, Chestnuts, VVallnuts, Filbeards, Goosberries,
&c. besides a great many not known in Europe. VVe saw there a kind of Grape which they call
Hallague, of the bigness of a mans thumb, which had no stone, but the skin and meat firm, and
of an admirable taste. This Garden is kept by ten Master-Gardeners, who have each of them
ten men to work under them; and there is this further convenience in it, that when the Fruits
are fit to eat, they permit any that have a mind to go into it, and to eat what they please of the
fruits, paying four Kasbeki, or two pence a piece; but they are forbidden to carry any away.
               
                  
The Citie hath, on all sides, very large Suburbs, which they cll Abath, whereof the fairest
and most considerable is, that which is called Tzulfa, wherein there are twelve Churches,
and above three thousand houses,The Suburbs. Tzulfa. equal, in point of building to the best in the Citie. The Inhabitants
of this quarter are Armenians, Christians, and most of them Merchants, and rich men,
whom Schach-Abas brought out of great Armenia, and planted in this place. They pay the
King but two hundred Tumains, by way of Tribure, which amount to about a thousand Livers,
which sum their Daroga, who, in our time, was called Chosrou Sulthan, and the Calenter, Seferas-beg,
are oblig'd to bring into the King's Coffers.
               On the other side of the River Senderut, lies the Suburbs of Tabrisabath,Tabrisabath. where live those
who were translated thither out of the Province of Tauristhan, by Schach-Abas; upon which
accompt, it is sometimes called Abasabath.
               The Suburbs of Hasenabath is the ordinary habitation of the Tzurtzi,Hasenabath. that is to say, the Georgians,
who are also Christians, and most of them Merchants, and wealthy men, as the Armenians,
as well by reason of the Trade they drive within the Kingdom, as in all other places
abroad. They delight much in making Voyages, especially to the Indies, and into Europe, in so
much that most of the Merchants who come to Venice, Holland, and other places, and who are
there called Armenians, are of this Nation. Not that the Christians, whether Armenians,
Georgians, or others, are not permitted to live within the Citie; but their living in these remote
Quarters proceeds from the desire they have to settle themselves in a place, where they
might live quietly, and enjoy the freedom of their conscience. For the Persians do not onely
suffer them to inhabit any where, since they have a particular Quarter assign'd them within the
Citie of Ispahan, behind the Metzit Mehedi, in a place which they call Nessera; but they have
also an affection for them, as well upon accompt of the advantage they make by Trading with
them, and the Tribute they pay, as particularly upon the score of their Vines. The Mahumetane
Law forbids those who are subject thereto, the drinking of Wine, and consequently the
cultivation of Vineyards. But the Persians, who are so given to Wine, that it were impossible
they should forbear it, imagine they commit no great sin, in the drinking of Wine, though it
be done even to excess, provided their Vineyards are dress'd by Christians. The Armenians are
expert enough at all things requisite to the ordering of the Vines; but they understand nothing
of the making or preserving of Wine. They are no lovers of white Wine, in so much that when
it hath not stood long enough in the Vat, or is not high colour'd enough to their fancy, they
put into it a little Brazil-wood, or Saffron, to heighten its colour. They do not keep it in
Buts or Tuns, but either in great earthen pots, or fill therewith the whole Cellar, without
using any Vessel at all.
               There is yet a noble part of the Suburbs towards the West-side of the Citie,Kebrabath. named Kebrabath,
deriving its name from a certain people called Kebber, that is to say, Infidels, from the
Turkish word Kiaphir, which signifies a Renegat. I know not whether I may affirm they are
Originally Persians, since they have nothing common with them but the Language. They are
distinguish'd from the other Persians by their beards, which they wear very big, as also by their
habit, which is absolutely different from that of the others. They wear, over their Wascoats,
a Casaque, or Coat, which falls down to half the leg, and is open onely at the neck and shoulders,
where they ty it together with Ribbons. Their Women cover not their faces, as those of
the other Persians do, and they are seen in the streets and elsewhere, contrary to the custom of
those, who pretend to live civilly; yet have they a great reputation of being very chaste.
               I made it my business to enquire,The Religion of the Kebbers. what Religion these Kebbers are of, but all the accompt I
could have of them, was, that they are a sort of Pagans, who have neither Circumcision, nor
Baptism, nor Priests, nor Churches, nor any books of Devotion or Morality among them.
Some Authors affirm, that they have a certain Veneration for the fire, as the antient Persians
had; but there is no such thing. They believe indeed the immortality of the Soul, and somewhat,
consonant to what the antient Pagans writ, of Hell, and the Elysian fields. For when any one
of them dies, they let a Cock out of the House of the party deceas'd, and follow him into the
fields without the Citie, and if a Fox take him by the way, they make no doubt but that his
Soul is sav'd: but if this experiment take not, they use another, which in their opinion is more
certain and infallible; which is this. They put about the deceas'd person his best Cloaths, hang
several Gold Chains and Jewels about his neck, and Rings, and whatsoever else he had of most
value of that kind, upon his fingers and in his hands, and so dress'd, he is brought to the Churchyard,
where they set him standing against the Wall, and keep him up in that Posture, by putting
a Fork under his Chin. If it happen, that the Crows, or any other ravenous Birds, pick
out his Right Eye, he is look'd upon as a Saint, there's no doubt of his Salvation, the Corps
is buried with Ceremonies, and is very gently and orderly let down into the Grave. But if the
said Birds unfortunately make at the Left Eye, 't is an infallible argument of his Damnation,
they conceive a horrour at him as a Reprobate, and they cast him head-long into the Grave.
               There are near and about Ispahan fourteen hundred and sixty Villages,Villages near Ispahan. the Inhabitants whereof
are all in a manner employ'd in the making of Stuffs and Tapistry, of Wool, Cotton, Silk,
and Brocado.
               
                  
The fields about the City lye very low, and it seems Nature was willing in that to shew an
effect of her Providence, inasmuch as were it not for that convenience, the Country would not
be Habitable,The fields about it. by reason of the execessive heats which reign there. For the convenience they derive
from this situation is this, that they can make the River Senderut over-flow, when the Summer
heats have melted the Snow on the neighbouring Mountains, and draw it all over the fields.
Iohannes de Persia saies indeed, that the River, falling again into its Chanel, leaves a slime behind
it, which corrupts the Air; but he is mistaken. For it is certain, that, some Provinces
only excepted, which lye upon the Caspian Sea, there is not any place in all Persia, where the
Air is more healthy than at Ispahan.
               True indeed it is, that the heats there are very great, especially in Iune and Iuly, but the
Inhabitants are not much incommodated thereby. For as, in Winter they have their Tenuars,
or Stoves, against the Cold, so in Summer, they have their Vaulted apartments, and their
Halls and Galleries, with Windows of all sides, that the Wind and Air may find their passage
in, to moderate their great heats. And though it freezes there so little, that in a Night's 
it does not make an Ice as thick as a man's finger, which thaws as soon as the Sun appears over
the Horizon, yet have they a way to make the Ice above two foot thick, and to keep it, to
be us'd to cool their Drinks in Summer. To do this, they make choice of a commodius place,
that is cool, and towards the North, pav'd with Free-stone or Marble, but uneven, and with
a little descent, upon which they pour the water, and as soon as that is congeal'd, they pour
on more, and by this means, in one night, they make an Ice a foot thick, which in the day
time they cover, that the Sun may not shine upon it: and so continuing this exercise for two of
three nights together, they provide Ice enough to serve them all Summer. Having made as much
as they desire, they break it in pieces, and put it up into Snow-Houses, whereof there are so
many at Ispahan, that, for two or three Kasbekis, a man may have as much as will suffice him
all Summer.
               The extent we have assign'd Persia,The air of Persia. from the 25 degree of the Aequator, to the 37 Northward
from the Aequinoctial line, discovers, that it is seated in the temperate Zone. Mount
Taurus divides it in the middle, almost as the Apennine does Italy, thrusting forth its Branches
here and there into several Provinces, where they are called by other particular names. The
Provinces, which have this Mountain between them and the North, are very hot; but the others,
which have it between them and the South, have a milder and more temperate Air. The
Kings of Persia heretofore took this convenience, to change the places of their habitations, according
to the Seasons, passing away the Summer at Echatane, which is now called Tabris, having
the Mountain between it and the South-west, and by that means not so much expos'd to
the great heats: and the Winter, at Susa, in the Province, which, from that name, is now called
Susistan, where the Mountain not only keeps off the North-wind from annoying the Inhabitants,
but also sends them heat, by the reflection of the Sun-beams at Noon, and makes the
place so delightful, that it hath thence the name Suse, that is, Lilly. In Spring and Autumn,
they liv'd at Persepolis, or at Babylon. The Modern Kings do still use the same convenience.
Schach-Abas, liv'd, in the Winter, at Ferabath, in the Province of Mesanderan; and Schach-Sefi,
sometimes at Tabris, and sometimes at Ardebil, or Caswin. The City of Ispaban is the
most commodious of any, as well for Winter as Summer, inasmuch as being seated in a great
Plain, at, in a manner, an equal distance of three Leagues from the Mountain, there is always
some little Wind stirring, which cools the Air, and comes into all Rooms.
               We had but too much experience of this change, and the inconveniences ensuing thereupon,
and found, that the heats of the day, and the cold of the nights, of which Iacob made his complaint
to Laban his Father-in-law, are there equally insupportable. For, being forc'd to Travel
in the night, and that during the hottest season of the year, we felt there a cold, which depriv'd
us of the use of our Limbs, and made us many times unable to get off our Horses, especially
when there was an East or North-wind: whereas, on the contrary, the South-wind sent
us sometimes such hot blasts as was ready to choak us.
               From what we have now said, it may be deduc'd, that all the Provinces of Persia are not
equally healthy,Diseases. and that there are some, where Diseases are much more common than in others.
Those of Schirwan and Kilan are very much subject to Feavers; but the Air of the City
of Tauris is so good, that a man hears no talk of that Disease there. Nay, on the contrary,
they say that those who are troubled therewith, may find their remedy in that place, even
without taking any Physick. Epidemical Diseases, such as the Bloody-Flux, and the Plague,
are not so ordinary here as in Europe. The Pox, which is called Sehemet Kaschi, that is, the
Disease of Kaschan, in regard it is more common there than elsewhere, or that there notice
was first taken of it, (as it is called in France, the Neapolitan Disease, and in England, and other
places, the French, in as much as, instead of going to Naples for it, where the French
were infected in the name of Charles VIII. they may now have it as conveniently at Par) is
very common at that place. 'Tis true Kaschan is a place excellently well seated, but the Air
must be somewhat unwholsome, when they want fresh water thereabous, and that it is here

the Tarantulas and the most dangerous Scorpions of all Persia are most rife. The Dropsie is
not very rare in the Province of Kilan; but there are very few troubled with the Stone in any
part of the Kingdome; and for the Gout, it is a Disease not yet known among them. The Inhabitants
are Long liv'd, it being an ordinary thing to see persons of a hundred years of age. I
knew a Judge in the Province of Serab, between Mokan and Ardebil, who was a hundred and
thirty years of age; and the Father of Hacwerdy, who went along with us into Holstein, was
above six score. Their temperance and sobriety contributes much to the good constitution of
their Body, the continuance of their Health, and length of their Lives.
               As to the soil of Persia,Persia is sandy and dry. the Province of Kilan excepted, which is very fertil, it is sandy and
barren in the Plains, every where in a manner checquer'd with little red Stones, and not bringing
forth ought but Thistles and Reeds, which they use for firing in their Kitchin instead of
Wood, where there is not any. The Province of Kilan only hath nothing of this drought.
But in the uneven parts of the Country, where the Mountains make several Valleys, the ground
is very good. Accordingly in these places it is, that most of their Villages are seated, inasmuch
as they are very Ingenious, in conveying the water, which rises out of the Mountains, by Chanels
of about four foot in breadth, which they use in their Gardens, and many times in till'd
Lands, to those places where it seldome Rains. To give the earth that moisture which Heaven
hath deny'd it, they raise up the ends of their Lands, which are about fifteen or twenty fathom
square, a foot higher than any other part, into which they let in the water out of their Chanels
over Night, and the next Morning let it out again: so that the earth, which hath been thus
moisten'd, receiving the Sun-beams almost perpendicular, brings forth all sorts of fruits in great
abundance.
               In the Cultivation of their grounds, they make use of Ploughs, which are so big in those places,
where the soil is strong and fat, as it is in Iruan and Armenia, that many times twenty or
four and twenty Buffles, or wild Oxen, are hardly able to draw them, and they require six
men to drive them. The furrows are a foot deep, and two foot broad. They ordinarily sow
only Rice, Wheat, and Barley. They care not for Rye, and when there chances to be any
Grains of it among the Wheat, as this often degenerates into the other, they weed it out, and
cast it away. Oats is a kind of Grain not known among them. They sow also Millet, Lentills,
Pease and Beans. They call the Ciches, Nagud, and the common Pease, Kulul.
               They sow also whole fields of Ricinus, or Palma Christi, which they call Kuntzut. They
beat the Grain thereof, to get an Oyl out of it, which they call Schirbach, and it is sweet and
pleasant, and very good to eat. The Peasants eat also the Grain; and mixing it with Ciches,
and Currens, they make their Deserts of it.
               There is in a manner no Province of Persia but brings forth Cotton,Cotton??? which they call Pambeh,
and there are whole fields cover'd therewith, especially i Armenia, Iruan, Nachtzuan, Keraath,
near Arasbar, in Adirbeitzan, and in Chorasan. It grows upon a Bush, two or three
foot high, having leaves like those of the Vine, but much less, and shoots forth at the extremity
of its Branches a bud of about the bigness of a Nut, which, when fully ripe, opens in several
places, and thrusts out the Cotton, through the clefts that are in the shell. Though there be
abundance of it spent in all sorts of Stuffs made in the Country; yet do they drive a vast Trade
with that which is unwrought, The Province of Kilan brings forth also a kind of Flax, the
thread whereof is very good, and fit for Cloath.
               The domestick Creatures,Domestick, Creatures as well such as are us'd in carriage, as others, are Sheep, Goats,
Buffles, Oxen and Cows, Camels, Horses, Mules, and Asses. The ordinary Forrage for Horses
is Barley, mixt with Chaff, or Rice mixt with shredded Straw. The Persians water not
their Horses till an hour and a half after they have eaten, contrary to the ordinary custom of
the Turks, who water theirs immediately after they have given them their allowance. There is
in Persia a certain kind of Herb, which they call Genscheht, which is sown much after the same
manner as we sow Saint-foin, once in seven years. It grows up three foot high, and brings
forth blew Flowers. It is cut twice a year, and they are only Persons of quality who give it
their Horses. There is very little common Hay, unless it be in the Province of Iruan, and Armenia.
In some Provinces they do not make any at all, because there is Grass enough all the
year long.
               Of all Cattel,Sheep. they have most Sheep. Of these they have very great Flocks, and it is their
most ordinary Food, though it be not of so pleasant a tast to those who are not accustomed
thereto. They are much of the same bulk with those of Europe, and sometimes a little bigger;
but short and flat-Nos'd with the Ears hanging down, as our Spaniels. They are but lean, in
regard the Tails, which weigh ten, twenty, nay sometimes thirty pounds, draw all the fat
out of them. The Tails have the bones and joynts, as our Sheep have, but the fat hangs to
them in great gobbets like locks of Wool; which much hinders them from running or leaping.
in Kurdesthan, near Diarbeker, and in Sirie, they have the Invention of putting the tails of these
Creatures upon a kind of little Cart with two Wheels, which is fasten'd by a little stick to the
Necks of them. The Sheep we saw among the Tartars, upon the Capian Sea, are in all things

like those of Persia; but those of the Tartars of Vsbeque and Buchar have a greyish long Wool,
curling at the ends into little white and close Knots, like Pearls, which makes a pretty show,
whence it comes that their fleece is more esteem'd than their flesh, in as much as this kind of furr
is the most precious of any us'd in Persia, next to Sables. They are very tenderly kept, and for
the most part in the shade, and when they are oblig'd to bring them abroad, they cover them as
they do Horses. These Sheep have as little tails as ours.
               The Persians have also great flocks of Goats,Goats. and they eat the flesh of them. Of the Suet they
make Candles; and it is of their skins that they make the Leather which we call Marroquin or
Spanish Leather, and is brought through Moscovy and Poland into the other Provinces of Europe.
               They have abundance of Buffles,Buffles. especially towards the Caspian-Sea, in Ferab, neer Ardebil,
in Eruan, and Surul, where some Peasants have five or six hundred of them. They are
kept in moist places, and they say their milk is very cooling, as is also the butter made thereof.
They have also Oxen like those of Europe; but, in the Province of Kilan, they have a bunch
of fat upon the neck, as those of the Indies have. I have been told, that the Cows will not
suffer themselves to be milk'd, if their Calves be not brought before them: so that if a Calf
chance to die, (for they never kill any to eat) they fill the skin with Straw, cast a little Salt
upon it, and they let the Cow lick it, by which means she stands quiet to be milk'd.
               The Persians have an aversion for Swine;They abhor Swine. whence it comes that the Armenians themselves,
who live among them, seldom breed any, unless it be in those places where they live apart, as
in the Suburbs of Tzulfa, where they have some few. They conceive they have very good reason
to have an aversion for this Creature, following the example of the Iews, and tell, to that
purpose, a ridiculous and obscene story, which they take out of the Alchoran, and relate;
That, one day, the Apostles intreated our Saviour, to tell them, after what manner Noah
liv'd in the Ark, during the Deluge. But our Saviour, without saying a word to them, having
taken a handfull of dirt, made the figure of a man with it, cast it upon the ground, and said to
it, rise up in the name of the Father. Immediately there started up an oldman, all white, whom
our Saviour asked, Who art thou? He made answer, I am Iaphet, the son of Noah. Our Saviour
ask'd him, whether he were so white when he died; whereto he answered, that he was
not, but that he became so just that moment, out of the fear he was in to appear before God, as
believing he had been rais'd up to come to the last judgement. Upon that, Iesus Christ commanded
him to acquaint the Apostles with all that had been done in the Ark. Iaphet obey'd, and
told them, among other things, that, one day, the Ark being so full of durt at that place where
the house of ease stood, that Noah, fearing it might take in water there, thought fit to consult
God in that extremity. The Divine answer was, that he should send an Elephant to the
said common house, and that of the Dung of that Creature and mans mixt together, there was
immediately engendred a Swine, which so turn'd up that heap of Ordure with his snowt, 
the Ark went very even. This nasty Creature having fill'd its Nostrils with filth, sneez'd very
violently, by means of which sneezing, there came out a Rat, which put Noah into greater
perplexity than before; in so much, that, to be deliver'd out of these troubles, he address'd
himself once more to God, and ask'd him what he should do in that unhappy conjucture. The
answer was, that God commanded him, to strike the Lion upon the head with a Wand, and
that he, being thereby put into a fury, fell a-roaring so loud, that, out of his Nostrils there
came out a Cat, which immediately pursued the Rat. The Persian Paraphrast of the Alchoran,
going on with his story, sayes, that Noah, knowing he was to continue forty years in the
Ark, separated the Males from the Females, out of a fear, that the several species multiplying,
the Ark would not be able to contain them, and that they might want meat. Of all Creatures,
onely the Dog had the freedom allow'd him to stay with the Bitch, at the bottom of the Ark.
One day the Cat having observ'd that those Creatures had the liberty to do what all the rest were
deny'd, went, and made her complaints to Noah, who reproching them with what they had
done, the Dog would not acknowledge the fact. But word was so often brought to Noah of the
Dog's transgression, that he desired God to make known the truth of it by an infallible proof,
and that afterwards the Dog desirous to line the Bitch became fasten'd to her; wherewith the
Cat having acquainted Noah, they were taken in the fact, and found guilty of having lied before.
Thence it comes, that, ever since that time, Dogs have been so fasten'd in the act of generation,
and have an inveterate fewd against Cats.
               They have several sorts of Camels.Camels. Those which have two bunches they call Bughur, and
those, which have but one, Schuttur. Of these last there are four kinds; that is, those, which,
by way of excellence, they call Ner, that is to say, the Male, which is engendred of a Dromedary,
or Camel, with two bunches, and a Female that hath but one, which is called Maje,
and these are not to be cover'd by any of another kind. These are the best and most esteem'd of
all the Camels, in so much that some of them are sold at a hundred Crowns a-piece. They carry
nine hundred, or a thousand weight, and are in a manner indefatigable. When they are hot,
they eat little, foam at the mouth, are angry, and bite; so that to prevent their doing any injury

to those who govern them, they have a kind of Muzzle put over their mouths, which the
Persians call Agrab. The Camels, which come of these, degenerate very much, and are heavy
and flow, whence the Turks call the Iurda Kaidem, and they are not worth above thirty or
forty Crowns.
               The third kind is that which they call Lohk; but these are not so good as the Bughurs, nor
do they foam at the mouth as the Ners, when they are hot: but when they go to rut, they
put out under the Throat a red bladder, which they draw in with their breath, life up their
heads, and snort often. These are worth about sixty Crowns apiece. They are not neer so strong
as the others, whence it is, that when the Persians would speak of a stout and daring man, they
say he is a Ner, and when they would express a poor-spirited and cowardly person, they call
him a Lohk.
               The fourth kind is, by the Persians, called Schutturi baad, and by the Turks, Ieldovesi,
that is, Wind-Camels. They are much less in bulk, but more active and sprightly than the
others: for whereas the ordinary Camels go but a footpace, these trot and gallop as well as
Horses.
               The King and the Chans have many Teams of them, and every Team consists in seven Camels
coupled together. They use them at Magnificent Ceremonies, either to meet Ambassadors, covered
with covering-cloaths of red Velvet, or Pack-saddles made of the same stuft, embroider'd
with Gold and Silver, with silver-bells about their necks, or to ride poste, nay, sometimes
in the Wars, in which they are thus much the more serviceable, that, in a defeat, they contribute
much to the saving of the Baggage. They trot so hard, that the Boy who guides them, and
to that end gets up first, is glad to be ty'd to the Pannel or Saddle by the waste. When they run,
they put out their heads, and open their Nostrils, and run with such violence, that it is impossible
to stay them. At our entrance into Scamachie and Ardebil, we saw a great number of
them, galsoping sometimes before, sometimes behind us.
               This is one of the greatest conveniences that Travellers meet with in Persia, as well for the
carrying of their own persons, as the conveyance of their Baggage and Commodities, which
they may, by this means, transport from one place to another, at a very easie rate, and with
little trouble. One man guides a Team, or as many as are fasten'd together: and if a man
thinks it not safe to travel alone, he may joyn with the Caravans, which go perpetually up and
down the Countrey, and with these is the safest way of travelling.
               The travelling of the Camels is at a certain rate,Carava. and therefore their Stages being set, they
find it no great trouble to make them reach their ordinary lodgings, which are either in Villages
upon the High-way, or at Caravanseras, expressely built for the entertainment of the Caravans.
Some of these Caravanseras have persons in them, who are as it were Hosts, and sell Provender,
but in others, you have onely the bare Walls. It is no great charge to keep the Camels.
Their sustenance is Thistles and Nettles and sometimes they thrust down their throats a
hard Paste, made of the chaff of Barley, about three pound in weight, much after the fashion of
the Loaves which the French Soldiers, who serve in the Low-Countreys, corruptly call Brindestocq.
Sometimes, they put into this Paste, Cotton-seed, which is very sweet, and as big
as a great Pease. They can endure thirst for two or three dayes together; wherein nature seems
to have made some Provision against the extremity men are put to for want of water, when they
travel over the Desarts and Heaths of those hot and dry Countreys. They onely touch the knees
of their fore-legs to make them bow to receive their burthens, and being so laid with their bellies
on the ground, they suffer a man to order them as he pleases. The harmonious sound of a
man's voyce, or an instrument, enlivens them; whence it comes that the Persians tie little
bells about their knees, and a pretty big one about their necks, not onely by reason of the long
trains of them that go together, it being necessary they should be heard at a great distance, to
give those notice who might unadvisedly come between them, but also to divert these Creatures
in their travel. The Arabians, to the same purpose, make use of Timbrels, when they travel
through the Desarts of their Countrey, in as much as whipping or beating does not make
them advance; but Musick, especially a man's voyce, animates, and inspires them with a
certain courage. What most troubles the Camels, is a kind of Snail, called Mohere, which
sometimes lies within the Thistles; if these sting them in the Nostrils, it proves mortal.
               The Camels are very revengefull, and remember a long time any injury they have receiv'd:
in so much, that, in Persia, a Camels anger is come into a Proverb, when they would speak of
an irreconcilable enmity. As to this particular, there is a very memorable example of a Camel,
which, being hot, and having not the Muzzle on, bit a servant who went along by him, in the
Arm. The servant gave him a many blows about the neck with a Cudgel, which part is the
tendrest about these Creatures. But the Camel had a cruel revenge of him, ere they came to
their journey's end. For some time after, being got loose in the night, he went among the servants,
who by reason of the cold lay near the Camels, that they might thrust their feet under
their bellies, and having pitch'd upon the person that had beaten him, he trod on him so as that
all his bones were crush'd and broken. The servant's Father demanded satisfaction, and had the

Camel adjudg'd him, to be dispos'd of as he pleasid. If anger proceed from Choler as its principle,
a man may justly wonder whence it comes, that Pliny sayes, that Camels, Horses, and
Asses, have no Gall. Nor could I ever find any reason why the same Pliny should affirm, after
Xenophon, that Camels have an aversion for Horses. When I told the Persians of it, they
laugh'd at me, and said, that it was not without reason Camels hated Horses; when many
times the Horses may get into the stables, and have a house over their heads, whereas the Camels,
which cannot get in by reason of the lowness of the Doors, are forc'd to lie abroad, and to
suffer the Horses to take up their quarters. And indeed there hardly goes any Caravan, but a man
may see Camels, Horses, and Asses put up together in the same stable, yet express not any aversion
or animosity one against another.
               True indeed it is, that the Females go twelve moneths, but those are extremely mis-inform'd,
who believe that the Male, when he covers her, turns his hinder part to her. This mistake
took its rise hence, that the Camels, when they make water, put their yards backwards between
their hinder legs; but in the work of Generation they use them otherwise. The Female
lies down upon her belly, and the Male covers her, after the same manner as Horses do.
And though this Creature be of a great bulk, yet is not its generative member, which is at
least three foot in length, any thicker than a man's little finger. This animal is seldome eaten,
as being more serviceable in point of work; but when they fall under their Burthens, or in
case they be stung by one of the Moheres, they kill them, with two thrusts into the Throat,
one at the place where it joyns to the Head, the other, towards the Breast, and then they eat
them.
               There are abundance of Horses in Persia,Horses. most of them well made. They are very handsome
about the Head, Neck, Ears, Crupper, and Leggs. Media bred heretofore such excellent
Horses, that they were all kept for the King. The Horses of those parts are at this time
very good ones, and there are of an excellent breed in the Province of Erscheck, near Ardebil;
but it is withall certain, that the Arabian Horses are incomparably better, and accordingly
more esteem'd by the King, who makes them the chiefest Ornament of his Stables. Next those,
they most value those of Turkey, though the King hath good breeding places in several Provinces
of his Kingdome, especially in Erscheck, Schirwan, Karabag, and Mokan, where is the
best Meadow-grounds in Persia. They make use of them fot the most part for men's Riding,
very seldome for the carriage of Commodities, and never almost in the Cart, which, all over
Persia, hath but two Wheels. And whereas the main forces of the Kingdome consist in their
Cavallry, it thence comes, that they are great lovers of Horses, and very tender in the keeping
of them. Yet with all this care, do they not make use of straw for Litter, but of Horse-Dung,
which they dry in the Sun, and make beds of it a foot deep, for the Horses, which could not
lye more at their ease upon quilts. This Litter serves them a long time, and when it is moisten'd
with stale, they put it into the Sun, dry it again, and so continue to make use of it. With
their soft beds, they also cover them with a Hair-cloath, lined with a kind of soft coarse cloath.
They also fasten them by the hinder feet, to a stake, that, in case they should break or slip their
Haltars, they may not get away, or hurt the other horses. All the manage they bestow on
them, consists only in accustoming them to start away, as Lightning, at the beginning of a
Race, and they call those Horses which exceed in swiftness Bad-pay, that is, Windy-heel'd. If
their Horses be White or Grey, they colour the Main, and the Tail, and sometimes also the
Leggs, with Red or Orenge; wherein the Polanders and Tartars are wont to imitate them.
They do not in any thing make so great ostentation of their expence, as in what is employ'd
about the harness of their Horses, which they sometimes cover with Plates of Gold or Silver,
and adorn the Reins, Saddles, and covering-Cloaths, with Goldsmiths Work and Embroidery.
Yet is not this custom of so late a beginning, but that there may somewhat of this kind be
observ'd out of the most antient Authors of the Greek History.
               They have also a great number of Mules,Mules. which for the most part are used only for Riding.
The King himself, and the Chans, ordinarily Ride upon these, and they stood us in good steed,
when all other kind of Riding had been very troublesome to us, in our sickness. They yield as
good a rate as Horses, so that a Mule, though none of the best, nor very handsome, is sold at
least for a hundred Crowns. I was told there were some white ones, but they are very rare,
and highly Valu'd; and I must confess, I never saw any.
               Asses are very common all over the East,Asses. but in Persia more than any where, and especially
at Ispahan, where there is an infinite number of them, in regard they allow not Carting within
the City. Those who drive them, have at the end of their Whip a great Bodkin, fasten'd with
a chain, wherewith they make a noise, and are perpetually pricking of this Creature, which
seems to be more cold and heavy in this Country, than any where else.
               The heats are so great in Persia,Fruits. and the weather so constantly fair and clear in the Summer,
that it is not to be much wondred they should have such good and excellent Fruits. As for those
which are spent in the Kitchin, they are there in greater abundance, but incomparably better
and more savoury than in Europe. Among others, the Onions are so big in the Province of

Tarum, near Chalcal, that one of them will weigh three pound. The Cabbages are there curled,
very tender, and of an excellent rast.
               Their most precious Fruits are Melons;Melons. and as their care in the ordering of them is extraordinary,
so they have every year great quantities of them. They sow them all only in good
mold, yet are there not any but what are very excellent. There are two sorts of them, to wit,
those which they call Kermek, from the work Kerm, which signifies hot, in regard they are
eaten in Summer, and they come betimes, and are fully ripe in Iune. These are as yellow as
Gold, and the sweetest of any. The other sort they call Charbusei pasi, and they come not to
perfect maturity till Autumn. These are very big, and weigh thirty, forty, or fifty pound
weight. They are kept, not only all the Winter, but even till there are new ones to be had:
and this is done with such industry, that, to distinguish them from the new ones,
a man must put his finger to them and see whether the Rind gives way; and by this means they
are never without Melons. They have a way also to keep Grapes, by wrapping them up in
green Reeds, and hanging them up to the roof of their Chambers. There is yet a third sort of
Melons, which they call Scammame, and are no bigger than Orenges; but these are wrought
or embroider'd, having amidst the embroidery red, yellow, and green spots. They are not very
good to eat, but the scent is very pleasant, and for that reason the Persians carry them in
their hands. There is yet another sort of water-Melons, which they call Hinduane, in regard
the first of them were brought out of the Indies, as we said elsewhere, i the description of the
City of Astrachan, where we had some occasion to speak of this kind of Fruit. It is very big,
and yet the stalks of it are so small, that the Persian Poets use them in their Inventions, to make
a comparison between them and the Wall-nut Tree, which being a great and lofty Tree, yet
brings forth but a Small Fruit: to shew, that, many times, a person of Mean Birth may do
very noble actions, and that, on the contrary, a Great Prince may do things that are poor and
unsuitable to his extraction.
               They have also several sorts of Citrulls,Citrulls. or Citrul-Cowcumbers, and among the rest, one,
which they call Kabach, and may be found among the Herbarists, under the name of Cucurbita
Lagenaria. They are about he bigness of a man's Head, and sometimes bigger, and have a
long Neck. They are eaten green, and before they are come to their full Maturity: for when
they are ripe, the Rind dries, and grows as hard as the Bark of a Tree, or boyled Leather, and
the meat within is so consum'd, that there being nothing left but the Seed, the Persians use them
instead of Flaggons, and make Drinking Cups of them.
               They have yet another kind of fruit,Padintzan. not known in Europe, which they call Padintzan. They
are like little Melons, or rather Cowcumbers. The fruit is green, save that at the end towards the
stalk, it is somewhat of a Violet Colour. The Seed is round and long, and of a pretty bigness.
This is not eaten raw, because it is a little bitter; but, being boyl'd, or fry'd in Butter, it is
a delicate Dish.
               The Climate of Persia is excellently good for the Vine.The Vine, There is no Province in the whole
Kingdome which doth not bring forth excellent Grapes; but in regard the Mahumetan Law
forbids them the use of Wine,Why the Mahumetans drink no Wine. they accordingly neglect the cultivation of the Vine. They say,
that the Prohibition made in the Alchoran against their drinking of Wine is grounded on a reason,
which they think very good, and seems to us pleasant enough to deserve a small Digression
in this Relation. They say then, that God, desirous to comfort Mankind, especially the poor,
for the injuries and affronts, which Great Lords and Wealthy Men are apt to do those who
have any dependence on them, sent into the World two Angels, named Haroth, and Maroth,
and forbad them particularly three things, to put any person to Death, to do any wrong, and
to drink Wine. Now it happened, that a young and very handsome Woman liv'd in some discontent
with her Husband, would needs have these Angels to undertake the arbitration of the
difference that was between them, and to gain their favour, she invited them to Dinner, and
press'd them to drink of her Wine, which was the best the Country could afford. The Angels,
at first, would have excus'd themselves, alleging the Prohibitions which God had made
them to that purpose; but at last she prevail'd with them, and they drunk so liberally of her
Wine, that they began to be very familiar with their fair Hostess, and to desire of her the greatest
kindnesse it is in a Woman's power to do a Man. The Woman was content they should have
their desires, but made this condition before hand, that one of them should shew her the
way by which people come down from Heaven, and the other that by which they go up into it:
but as soon as the Angels had shown her the way, the Woman slunk away from them, and
went stright to Heaven. God finding her Cloath'd as she was, ask'd her how she could get up
to Heaven without Dying. She made answer, that it was by the information of the Angels,
and for the preservation of her Honour. Which oblig'd God to Crown her Chastity with an
extraordinary Glory; and whereas she was one the most Beautifull Women in the World,
it was accordingly his Pleasure, that she should have more light than any of the other Stars,
and so he made her that Star or Planet which is called Venus. Afterwards having called the Angels
before him, he told them, that in requital of the good they had done, he was content

they should condemn themselves to some punishment which they thought proportionable to their
Sin: whereupon they went into the Cave of Bebil, between Babylon and Betreh, where thy
were hung up by the Feet, to a great Iron Chain, in which posture they were to continue till
the day of Judgment.
               The Persians, in obedience to Mahomet's command, make no Wine; but in regard they
are great lovers of it, they do not only permit the Christians to make thereof, but indeed the
chief reason why they permit the Armenians to live among them, is, that they may buy thereof
of them. They do not make it so well as it is done in Europe, and have not the Ingenuity to put
it into Buts, but keep it in great Earthen Pitchars, each of which contains near half a Barrel, as
we said elsewhere. The Seder, that is, the chief of the Religion of the Persians, to expresse
his zeal, did sometimes order the Pitchars of the Armenians to be broken. The Persians are
permitted to make a sirrup of sweet Wine, which they boyl, till it be reduc'd to a sixth part,
and be grown as thick as Oyl.Duschab. They call this Drugg Duschab, and when they would take of
it, they dissolve it with water, and add thereto a little Vineger, all which together make a very
pleasant Drink. The Minatzim, or Astrologer of Scamachie, gave me of it at a treatment
he made for me at his own House. In the more Northerly Provinces of Persia, where the Wine
is not very good, the Inhabitants dissolve the Duschab in the Country Wine, whereto they by
that means give both the Colour and Tast of Sack.
               Sometimes they boyl the Duschab so long, that they reduce it into a Paste, for the convenience
of Travellers, who cut it with a Knife, and dissolve it in water. At Tabris, they make
a certain Conserve of it,Helwa. which they call Helwa, mixing therewith beaten Almonds, Flower,
and peel'd Filbeards or small Nuts. They put this mixture into a long and narrow Bag, and having
set in under the press, they make of it a Paste, which grows so hard, that a man must have
a Hatchet to cut it. They make also a kind of Conserve of it, much like a Pudding, which
they call Zutzuch,Zutzuch. thrusting through the middle of it a small Cotton thread to keep the Paste
together.
               There are some Chymists, who maintain that by the same reason, to prevent the charges
arising upon the transportation of Wine, it were possible to reduce five Tuns to one, by causing
sweet Wine to be boyl'd away to the fifth part. For, as they say, there is no likelyhood the
Wine should lose ought of its Spirits, before it hath wrought, and is dispos'd into Vessels, and
that afterwards adding thereto as much fair water, out of which the superfluous humour hath
been evaporated, it might be restor'd to the same quantity, and reduc'd to the same degree of
goodness it had been of before. But I am of opinion, that if this were feasible, the experiment
had been long since try'd, especially in France, instead of turning Wine into Aquavitae.
               There are two sorts of Grapes in Persia, but the best and sweetest are at Schiras, and Tabris;
whence they bestow on the most delicate of them the name of Tabersch. This Grape is long, and
hath no stone, and it may be kept all Winter. Those which they call Keseki, are yellowish
and sweet, and grow in Tarum, at Tabris, and at Ordebath: but of these a man must eat sparingly,
for fear of a Bloody-Flux.
               The small Grapes, which we call Currens, are there yellowish, and bigger than those which
grow in the Isle of Zanthe. They call them Kischmisch, and the best of them grow at Bawanat,
near Herat.
               Besides these, there are yet several other sorts of Grapes, not known in Europe; among the
rest, those which they call Hallague. The Grape it self is above an inch and a half thick, but
the meat of it is hard, juyce-less, and without stones, and they are kept all the year long: as
also the Enkuri Alideresi, the bunch whereof is above a foot long, and the Grapes are about
the bigness of a Damasin, of a dark red Colour, full of juyce and very sweet; but they will not
keep. There does not grow any of these save at one place, in the Province of Iran, between
Ordabath and Choddaserin They derive their name from their great Prophet Aly, who being,
one day, in Winter, at that place, desired a Vinedresser, whom he met, to give him some
Grapes; whereto the other making answer, that it were impossible to satisfie his desire, in that
season, Aly bid him go into the next Vineyard, and he should find some. He went, and according
as he had said, found the fairest Grapes he had ever seen; upon which occasion, they
are called Enkuri Aly deresi, that is, the Grapes of the little Valley of Aly.
               There is no Fruit-Tree in Europe,Fruit-Trees. but is to be found in Persia; but, besides those, they have
many, not known to us; as a sort of Pears, which they call Melletze, which grow near the
City of Ordebath, about the bigness, and much of the colour of Citrons. The scent of them
is very sweet and pleasant, and they are very juicy, but not delighfull to the tast.
               Pomegranate-Trees, Almond-Trees, and Fig-Trees grow there without any ordering or
cultivation, especially in the Province of Kilan, where you have whole Forests of them. The
wild Pomegranates, which you find almost every where, especially at Karabag, are sharp or
sowrish. They take out of them the Seed, which they call Nardan, wherewith they drive a
great Trade, and the Persians make use of it in their sawces, whereto it gives a colour, and a
picquant tast, having been steep'd in water, and strain'd through a cloath. Sometimes they boyl

the juyce of these Pomegranates, and keep it to give a colour co the Rice; which they serve
up at their entertainments, and it gives it withall a tast which is not unpleasant. The Persians
use sharp sawces with most of their meat, and thence it comes, that among them, you very
seldome find any person troubled with the Scurvy, which is a Disease, too well known, and
mortal in several Provinces of Europe.
               I shall say nothing of those other Fruits, which we have also in Europe, as of their Narintz,
or Orenges, Limec, Citrons, Meschmeschi, Apricocks, Scafralu, Peaches, &c. only thus much,
that they are not equally good every where. The best Pomegranates grow in Iescht, and at
Caswin, but the biggest, in Karabag. Ispahan is famous for its good Melons; Caswin, for
its Peaches; Tabris, for its Apricocks; and the Provinces of Kilan and Lahetzan for Silks.
               The Trees out of which they get this rich Commodity,Silk may, no doubt, be very well numbred
among the Fruit-Trees, not only in regard that it is true they bear Fruit, but also upon
this score, that the Persians every where fill their Gardens with these plants. They are white
and black Mulbery-Trees, which they plant so close one by another, that a man can hardly
pass between the Trees, but they order them as Bushes, and suffer them not to grow above five
foot and a half high, that they may easily reach to all the Branches. In the Spring, as soon as
these Trees begin to shoot forth their leaves, the Persians begin to hatch their Silk-worms. To
do this, they carry the Seed in a little bag under the arm pit, where the heat of seven or eight
daies hatches them. Then they put them into a wooden dish, upon the Mulbery-leaves, which
they change at least once a day, having a great care that they be not wet. At the end of five
dayes, they sleep three, and then, they dispose them into Rooms, or Barns; kept very clean
and prepar'd for that purpose, and in the Province of Kilan, they have particular Buildings for
that end. Along the beams of these Buildings they nail laths, or cleft pieces, such as Hoops
are made of, upon which they lay the Mulbery-branches with the leaves on, and put the
Worms upon them, every day changing these branches, and at last, when they are grown
pretty big, twice or thrice a day; and they so shut all ouvertures of the Barns, which are cover'd
with Nets, that the very Birds cannot get in to eat them. In the mean time, and before
they begin to spin, they sleep eight dayes more; but there must be a great care taken, that
Women troubled with their Monethly infirmity, come not near them; inasmuch as it would
kill them, and as it were smother them in their own moisture. After seven weeks life, they
begin to spin, which is known as well by their satiety, in regard they then give over eating, as
by the Silk which comes out at their Mouths. They suffer them to work twelve dayes at their
God, and in the mean time they very carefully watch the place where they spin. That time
expir'd, they find as many Cods, as there had been Worms, and they make choice of the
biggest for the Seed. All the rest is cast into a Kettle of boyling water, into which they ever
and anon put a Besom, made for that purpose, whereto the Silk sticks, and they immediately
wind it up, and what remains they cast away. That which is kept for Seed they set upon a Table,
out of which, about fifteen dayes after there are hatched Butter-flies, and these produce
the Seed, which is kept in a temperate place till the year following. In this Commodity of Silk
consists the greatest Trade of all Persia, nay in a manner af all the East, as it is, in effect, the
Richest and most Noble of any that is driven in Europe.
               We may put,Nefte. into the number of the Fruits of this Country, the Nefte, which is gotten out
of several sources,Salt. near Baku; as also the Salt, which is drawn out of the Salt-pits of Nachtsuan;
but this is fairer, and as clear as Chrystal in Kulb, Vrum, Kemre, Hemedan, Bisethun, Suldus,
and Kilissim. There are no other Pits or Mines where they work. There are indeed certain Forges,Iron???
at Masula, and Keintze; but the best Iron comes from Masula, where it is so soft
and tractable, that it is malleable, and yields to the Hammer without heating. There are Gold
and Silver Mines between Serab and Miane, but they cannot be wrought for want of Wood,
which is so scarce thereabouts, that the advantage might be made of them would not defray the
charges. Between Pirmaras and Schamachie, we saw a Mountain of Lapis Specularis, which,
when the Sun shone upon it, look'd like a heap of Diamonds.
               The Persians are of mean stature.The stature of the Persians, Xenophon saies, that they were most of them bulky and fat:
and Marcellinus, on the contrary, affirms, that, in his time, they were spare-bodied, and
dry. They are so now, but strong, and have great limbs, their faces inclining to an Olive-colour,
Black-hair'd, and Hawk-nos'd. The men are shav'd once in eight dayes, contrary to
the custom of the antient Persians, who suffered their Hair to grow, as do at present the Seid,
that is, the kinred of Mahomet, who, as they say, went so. They also shave their Beards,
leaving only Mustachoes. They are only a sort of Religious men, called Pyhr, who suffer
their Beards to grow upon their Chins, and about their Cheeks. These people are in great Veneration
among them, upon the accompt of their apparent sanctity, which principally consists
in abstinence. There are also those, who never cut their Mustachoes, which by that means cover
their Mouths; and this they do in remembrance of their Prophet Haly, who wore them in
that manner. These last are called Suffi; and they say Haly wore his Mustachoes so, for the
following reason: That when Mahomet took that Voyage to Paradise, which the Alchoran

speaks of, Azoara, 27. Haly follow'd him. At first they made some difficulty at the Gate to
let him in, till such time as he told the Poter, that he was Schir Chodda, that is, God's Lion.
Being got in, he saw that the Angels made Mahomet drink of a certain excellent Wine,
whereof he was so happy as to have one Goblet presented to him, which he took off; but some
drops of the Divine draught sticking on his Mustachoes, he would never afterwards suffer them
to be cut.
               The Persians have a great fancy to black hair, and they bear with the flaxen-hair'd, but not
without some trouble; but for red-hair'd people, they have a strong aversion. They have so
great an esteem for black hair, that when it is not fully black, they colour it so. To do that,
they make use of the herb and seed of Wesme, which is brought from Bagdat, and is somewhat
like that which the Herbarists call Securidaca, which they beat very small with the rinds of
Pomegranates, and mix therewith Soap and Arsenick; they boyl this composition in Spring-water,
and rub their Hair therewith, which they afterwards wash with a strong lye, made with
unslak'd Lime. They make use also of the water, which issues out of the Vines, in the Spring-time:
the Men rub their Mustachoes therewith, and Maids their Hair, which fall down over
their shoulders ty'd up in several tresses; out of an opinion they all are of that this makes them
grow.
               They have also a custom of Painting their Hands,Paint their Hands and Nails. and, above all, their Nails, with a Red Colour,
inclining to Yellowish or Orenge, much near the colour that our Tanners nails are of???
There are those who also Paint their Feet. This is so necessary an ornament in their Married
Women, that this kind of Paint is brought up, and distributed among those that are invited to
their Wedding Dinners. They therewith Paint also the Bodies of such as dye Maids, that when
they appear before the Angels Examinants, they may be found more neat and handsome. This
Colour is made of the herb, which they call Chinne, which hath leaves like those of Liquorice,
or rather those of Myrele. It grows in the Province of Erak, and it is dry'd, and beaten, small as
Flower, and there is put thereto a little of the juyce of sowr Pomegranate, or Citron, or sometimes
only fair Water; and therewith they Colour their hands. And if they would have them
to be of a darker Colour, they rub them afterwards with Wall-nut leaves. This colour will
not be got off in fifteen dayes, though they wash their hands several times a day.
               Their Cloaths have no proportion to their Limbs.Their Habit. Their Coats and upper Garments are
large and hang loose, not unlike the Garments of Women. They express a certain Effeminacy
in their gate. They go as it were Jetting and Wadling, and with very little Gravity. I am of
opinion, that this scurvy Habit is deriv'd from their manner of sitting, which is, as our Taylors
do; whereto being accustomed from their infancy, they are not so strong in the Hamms as they
would otherwise be. Diodorus Siculus ascribes the invention of this kind of Garments to Semiramis,
and tells the occasion of it, as do also most of the other antient Authors. The Coeffure
of the men, which they call Mendils, and the Turks, Tulbans or Turbants, is made of Cotton
cloath, or some Silk stuff, that is very fine, and of several Colors, and being about eight or
nine Ells in length, comes many times about their Heads, having the folds slightly sow'd, or
drawn with a Gold thread. Those of their Priests, and particularly, of the Hasis, is white, as
are also all their Garments. There are some put to their Mendils a tassel of Silk, which hangs
down their backs, or over their shoulders, a quarter of an Ell or better in length. The Seid,
that is, those who pretend to be of the Posterity of Mahomet, and assume the title of his Successors,
have their Mendils of green silk. Some Persians, even of the greatest of the Kingdome,
wear furr'd Caps, the inside and outside being of Buchar Sheep skin, so as that the Wool hangs
down from the edges the length of a man's finger, and is as soft as Silk. These Caps are esteem'd
in Persia as the Castors are in Europe, and are sold at ten or twelve Crowns a piece. They wear
these about their Heads, in Summer as well as VVinter, though a man might think, that, by
reason of the extreme sultriness of the weather, they should be very troublesome and incommodious.
This custom of keeping their Heads alwayes very hot, brings them to that tenderness,
that they dare not expose them to the Cold, no not in calm weather. To this purpose I
conceive I may allege what Herodotus sayes;Lib. 3. to wit, that, after a fight between the Persians
and the Egyptians, where there fell a great number of men on both sides, care was taken that
the Bodies of both parties were dispos'd into several places, and it was found, some time after,
that the Skuls of the Persians, were so thin and delicate, that a man might thrust his finger into
them, and that, on the contrary, those of the Egyptians were so hard, that they could not be
broken with stones. The reason he gives for it, is, that he sayes, the Egyptians, who were accustomed
from their infancy to go bare-headed in the Sun, were by that means grown hard,
whereas the Persians, having their Heads alwayes wrapp'd about, were very tender in their
Skuls. And indeed they never uncover them, neither at their Devotions, nor when they Salute
other men, no, not when they speak to their King: but when they salute any, they do it by a
low inclination of the Head, and putting of their hand to their Breast.
               Many of the Persians wear Red Caps,Kisilbaschs whence the Turks take occasion, to call them, by way
of derision, Kisilbaschs, that is to say Red-Heads. Most Authors, who treat of the affairs of

Persia, write this word Cuselbas, Queselbach, or Querselbach; but the right name is Kisilbasch,
as being compounded of the word Kisil, which hath two different significations, to wit, that
of Red, and of Gold, and Basch, which signifies a Head. Paulus Iovius, in the 13. Book of his
Histories, and, after him, F. Bizarro, in the 10. Book of his History of Persia, affirm; that
Tefellis, Disciple of Harduellis, otherwise named Eider, who, as they say, liv'd about the beginning
of the sixteenth age, was the first who brought the Persians to wear Red Caps, to distinguish
them from the Turks, at their separation from them in the business of Religion. But
they are both mistaken: for the truth is, that the Persians, when they broke Communion with
the Turks, and made a particular Sect of the Mahumetane Religion, by the advice of Schich-Sefi,
the Author of their new Opinions, immediately held, that the first Successors of Mahomet,
Omar, Osman, and Ababeker, had usurp'd the Succession, to the prejudice of Aaly's
right, and would have this last to be accounted the Propher, and that his twelve Successors,
whom we shall name hereafter, when we come to speak of the Religion of the Persians, were
Canoniz'd, and put into the number of their Imans, or Saints; that they were look'd upon as
having that quality, and that their Ecclesiasticks or Religious men wore Red Caps, made with
twelve foldings, in form much like the Bottles used in Languedoc and Provence, which have great
and flat Bellies, and very long and narrow Necks.
               This difference in matter of Religion, occasion'd a great War between the two Nations,
wherein the Turks, making advantage of their Arms, were very cruel towards the Persians,
but especially the Ecclesiasticks, by reason of the aversion which they had for that new Religion.
And in regard their Coiffure, or what they wore about their Heads, distinguish them
from the others, they left off their Caps in several places of the Kingdom, and oblig'd the rest to
follow their example. This persecution lasted, till Schach-Ismael l. finding himself forc'd by
the Turks to retreat into the Province of Kilan, and having some reason to fear, that, within a
short time, he might see the whole Kingdom in the hands of the profess'd enemies of his Religion,
resolv'd to meet them, and to put all to the hazard of a Battel. To this end, he sent
Persons to represent to the Provinces and the chief Cities of the Kingdom, the danger, whereto
the State, their Liberties, and Religion were expos'd, if they resolv'd not to make what opposition
they could in that extremity against the Turk, sending them word, that he would grant
those who should serve him in Person, in that Conjuncture of affairs, a general and perpetual
Exemption, for them and their Posterity. By this means, he got together an Army of three
hundred thousand fighting men, wherewith he march'd directly to Ardebil, as desirous to begin
his Exploits by a pious Enterprize, in recovering the Sepulchre of Schich-Sefi out of the
hands of the Turks, who were forc'd out of that City. He was no sooner become Master of
it, but he confirm'd all he had promis'd touching the Exemption, and to the end those might
be known who were to enjoy the benefit of it, he ordered the making of these Red Caps, which
were done with Twelve foldings, in remembrance of their Twelve Imans. But in regard the
City was not able to find Scarlet enough, for so great a number of Caps, a Shooe-maker of
Ardebil would needs make twelve of them, of Maroquin, or Goats Leather, of the same
Colour, which Schach-Ismael presented to the chief Commanders of his Army. He ordered
them to be Red, to make a certain representation of the Crown of Aaly, whom the Persians
give the quality of King, as well as of Prophet, as they do these Caps the name of Tatsch, that
is to say, a Crown. Whence it comes, that the Persians are so far from taking it ill, that they
are called Kisilbasks, that they think it an honour done them, though, in effect, only those of
the Posterity of Aaly, and these exempted Persons, wear red Caps: the former having them
cover'd with Linnen Cloath, or some other kind of Stuff, and the others without any thing at
all about them. The Posterity of these exempted Persons do still enjoy these Privileges, and
out of them is chosen the Guard for the King's Person, as being look'd upon, as the Swizzers
are in the Courts of diverse Princes of Europe.
               Their ordinary Habit are a kind of sleeveless Coats of Cotton, or Silk, of several Colours,
which come down to the calves of their Legs. Those of Cotton have flowers printed upon the
Cloath, and are quilted, as Mattresses. They draw the sides of them together, under the left
arm, and gird themselves with a Skarf about two Ells in length, called Tzarkesi, which comes
several times about the Body. The richer sort have, upon this, another rich Skarf, which they
call Schal, made of a very fine stuff, brought by the Indians into Persia: for their Silk being
much fairer, and their Colours more lively and finer, than those of Persia, their Stuffs are accordingly
more highly esteem'd.
               When the Mollas, or Priests come before the Mchere, they take off that rich Skarf, to
express their Humility. The other Persians wear in it a Ponyard, their Knives, their Handker-chiefs,
and their Money; and those, whose profession it is to write for others, carry in them
their Ink-horns, a Pen-knife, and a little Whet-stone, Letters, and all that the Muscovites
are wont to thrust into their Boots or Buskins, which serve them instead of Pockets. Persons
of quality, and the King himself, wear, over this Coat, a kind of Rocket, without sleeves,
which reaches but to the Waste, border'd with Sables. When they go abroad, whether a-foot,

or on horse-back, they cast over these, a silk Garment of diverse Colours, or wrought with
Gold flowers, which they call Iakub Cahni, from a King, of that name, who was the first
that ever wore them in Persia. Their Breeches are of Cotton, made after the fashion of Drawers;
accordingly they wear them under their shirts, and they reach down to their feet. Their
Shirts are of Cotton Cloath, and for the most streak'd with Red. Their Stockings are of Woollen
Cloath, unhandsomely cut out, without any shape, or any proportion to the Legg. They
wear them very wide, and commonly, they are made of green Cloath: a colour which is abhorr'd
by the Turks; and this is indeed one of the chiefest differences of their Religion: upon
this accompt, that Mahomet having worn a green Cap, the Persians, the more to dishonour
that Colour, put their Feet into that which their great Prophet wore about his Head. Their
Shooes, which they call Kefs, are very picked at the toe, and very low quarter'd, so as that
they put them off and on, with as much ease as we do our Slippers. Which convenience they
the more stand in need of, in regard they put them off in the Antichamber, as well at their own
Houses, as when they visit their Friends, either upon business or otherwise. To this purpose,
I remember, that one day, going to the Chan's of Scamachie, about the time that he gives audience,
for the Administration of Justice, we found, in the Antichamber, more shooes than
the richest Shooe-maker thereabouts had in his shop, and standing by them, one I may call the
Shooe-keeper, who with a forked stick gave those their shooes who went out.
               The women wear much finer stuffs than the men do,The Habit of the Women. and have not any thing to tye about the
waste: but their Drawers and Smocks are made after the same fashion as the Drawers and Shirts
of men. Their Stockings are ordinarily of red or green Velvet, and they have little or no Ornament
about the Head, but suffer their Hair to hang down negligently, in several tresses, down
the back, and about the shoulders. All the Ornament they have about their Heads consists in
two or three rows of Pearls, which they do not wear about their Necks, as Women do elsewhere,
but about the Head, being set over the Fore-head, and falling down along the Cheeks
to be fasten'd under the Chin, so as that their Faces seem'd to be set in Pearls. Which may give
a little light to that expression in the Canticles,Chap. 1. Thy Cheeks are comely with rows of Iewels.
Young maids sometimes wear Rings, with pretious Stones in them, in the right Nostril, as the
Tartarian Women do. They also wear of them on their Fingers, and about their Arms, and
they have bracelets of Silver-plates. But the Mahumetan Law allows not the men to wear
Gold Rings. Whence it came, that when our Ambassadors presented Saru Taggi, Chancellor
of Persia, with a very fair Diamond Ring, he had the stone taken off the Collet; and put into
Silver, and so presented it to the King. The Women do not uncover their faces as they go about
the City, but have over them a white Veil, which reaches down below their knees, which
they open a little to see their way. The Persians make an embleme of it, to signifie, that, many
times, in a handsome Body, a wicked Soul may be log'd, and that, under a fair appearance
of good Life, a great number of enormous Vices may find shelter; as that Veil does often
times, under very rich Cloaths, hide a very Ugly Woman.
               The Persians are very neat,The Persians are very neat. as well in their Rooms and Furniture of them, as in their Habit,
wherein they would not have so much as a spot to be seen: insomuch that those who are of ability
to do it, change them as soon as they are ever so little stain'd, and others, who are not
much before hand with the World, have them wash'd once a week. VVhich is very much contrary
to the humour of the Muscovites, among whom a man seldome sees any Cloaths but what
are full of Nastiness, and shine with Grease. Nay it is certain, that the Stables and other such
Houses of the Persians, are kept much neater, than the Stoves and Lodging Chambers of the
Muscovites.
               The Persians are of a ready VVit and sound Judgement.Iagenious. They apply themselves to Studies,
and are very excellent in Poesy. Their Inventions are tich, and their Fancies subtil and strong.
They are so far from being any way Vain-glorious, that they slight no man, but, on the contrary,
they are complaisant, and of a Taking Conversation, very civil and obliging among
themselves, but especially to Strangers. The Submissions, wherewith they express themselves
in their Complements, exceed any thing they do in that kind in France. A Persian, to invite
his Friend to come into his House, and profer him his service, delivers himself in these terms:
Let me intreat you to make my House noble by your presence; I sacrifize my self to your Commands;
I lye prostrate at your Feet; to serve you, I wish the apple of my Eye might help to pave your
way, &c. but for the most part, these are indeed but Complements. This puts me in mind of
a Persian, who coming to our Physician to acquaint him with a pain he had in his side, told
him, that if he could Cure him, he would give him his Head; whereupon it being represented
to him, that he should not be so much troubled at the want of Health, who was so prodigal
of his Life, he made answer, that he meant otherwise, but that it was their manner of speaking.
               The Persians have ever had the reputation of not being over-carefull to speak the truth;Liars. and
even to this day, those, who would speak it at all times, must pass, in their accompt, for
people a little troubled with simplicity. Whence it comes, that no man thinks himself injur'd,
when they say to him, Drugh Mikui, or, in the Turkish Language, Galan Diersen, that is,

thou hast told an untruth, and the word Galantsi, which signifies a Lyar, is accounted a drollish
expression, though Herodotus sayes it was a Vice the antient Persians hated most of any, and
that they made it their main business to bring up their young men, to Ride and Shoot well, and
to speak the Truth.
               They are very faithfull in observing the particular friendships they contract together,True in their friendships and
they enter into Fraternities among themselves, which last as long as they live, nay they are so
exact in the improving of these, that they preferr them before all Obligations of either Blood
or Birth. In Germany, there is no reckoning paid, but those Drunken persons who clubb to it,
make some fraternity; yet is not the friendship contracted thereby, ever the greater, in regard
there cannot really be any between such as are incapable of it: but in Persia, it is far otherwise.
It is their custom to make every year a great Feast, whereat all the men between whom there is
any thing of Kinred, and some other friends, meet together, and if, at that assembly there be
any persons, who, out of a reciprocal and particular affection, are desirous to enter into a
more close and constant friendship, they address themselves to some one of the Company, whom
they take by the border of his Garment, and having told him that they make choice of him for
their Babba, Father or God-father, which the other cannot deny, they go all three together,
to their Calif, (there being no Family but hath its own) kiss his Hand, and crave his Benediction.
To receive which, they lye down upon their Bellies, first the God-father,
and afterwards the Brethren, at the Calif's feet, who gives each of them three strokes with a
wand upon the Back, pronouncing at the first stroke, the word Alla, at the second, that of
Mahomet, and at the third that of Haly. That done, they kiss the wand, and with this Ceremony
the Fraternity is establish'd. And this kind of alliance is so sacred, according to their
opinion of it, that they affirm, there is no other sin but may be pardoned; that Sacrilege and
Idolatry are not irremissible, and that a man may hope for pardon, if he hath drunk Wine, nay
in case he hath abus'd an Abdalla; but that the privileges of this kind of Fraternity cannot be
Violated, and the offence not be Punish'd. And if it happen that two of these Brethren fall
out, they are to be reconcil'd at the next assembly; which is done thus. He who hath been injur'd
comes to his Door who did him the injury, bowing down his Head, and, with his Arms
carelessly hanging down, continues in that posture, till the other hath intreated him thrice to
come into his House, and thence they go together to the assembly, where the reconciliation is
perfected. The Persians are of a good nature, and very sensible of any kindness done them;
but where they hate, they are irreconcilable. They are Couragious, and good Soldiers, going
chearfully upon any design or engagement, though never so dangerous.
               They are also modest, and very reserv'd; whence it comes, they never make water standing,
but squat down as Women do, and when they have done, wash themselves. It is upon
this accompt, that, at Weddings, and other great assemblies, they have in some by-places, several
earthen pots full of water. If they be near a Brook, or River, they will be sure to make
water in it, whence the Turks, by derision, call them Cher Scahei, that is, the King's or Aly's
Asses, in regard Asses never go through water but they piss; on the contrary, the Persians call
the Turks Seksumi, because they piss, like Dogs, against a Wall. Certain it is that Persons of
Quality in Turky observe, in this particular, the custom of the Persians, and both Nations take
a great care, when they either make water, or ease Nature otherwise, not to turn their Faces
or their Backs towards the South, in regard that when they say their Prayers they look that
way.
               But it is also true,
                     
                   that this modesty is only as to the external part, and that otherwise they
are more Luxurious than any other Nation in the World. For, not thinking it enough to marry
several VVives, and besides, them, to have a great number of Concubines, they have a kindness
left for common VVhores. Accordingly, there is no City, Ardebil only excepted, where
there are not publick places appointed for that sport, under the protection of the Magistrate.
During our aboad at Scamachie, one of our Souldiers having had his pleasure of a VVoman, got
away without paying her. She made her complaints to the Chan, who sent to the Ambassadors,
to entreat them to take same course that she might be satisfy'd, sending them word, that
it was but reasonable, that the Kahbe, who pay the King a great Tribute, should be also paid
the Salary due to them. VVe have given an accompt elsewhere, what use the Persians make of
them at their great Feasts; and this custom is so antient, that Herodotus speaks of it, when he
sayes, that the Ambassadors of the Persians told Amintas, King of Macedon, that it was
their custom, when they entertain'd their Friends to give them also the Divertisement of VVomen.
He brought into the place where they were men in womens Cloaths, who kill'd the Ambassadors.
               The King himself maintains a great number of these VVomen at his own charge,The King Persia hath several Wives and Concubins. and makes
it his Divertisement at Meals to see them Dancing and shewing all manner of postures before
him: so that those who are desirous to take up that Profession, must not only be handsome, but
also pleasant and active. The King takes them along with him into the Country, nay into the
Army, after the example of the antient Kings of Persia, and particularly that of Darius, who,

as Q. Curtius affirms, had, in his Retinue, three hundred and sixty Concubines, all very
sumptuously Cloath'd.
               Sodomy is no extraordinary sin among them,Sodomy not punish'd in Persia. nor is it punish'd as a Crime. Saru Taggi, who
was Chancellor of Persia at the time of our Travels, was not punish'd for his Sodomy, but for
the Violence he had done in the Commission of it. The King himself was given to this Vice,
and so far from punishing it in another, that, as we were told, in the year 1634. Schach-Sefi
being at the siege of Eruan, one of the Colonels, who was got drunk at the King's quarters,
would, at his return to his own, in the heat of his VVine, having forc'd a young Lad that serv'd
him, and had often before refus'd to hearken to his lewd addresses. The Boy, to prevent the
violence, which he now saw was unavoidable, layes hold on the Ponyard, which his Master
wore at his Girdle, and therewith run him into the Heart. The next day, the King missing the
Colonel, ask'd what was become of him. Some body told him, he had been kill'd by one of
his Domesticks, and gave him an account how it had been done. The Boy was brought before
him, who very ingenuously confess'd what had pass'd between his Master and him, and avow'd,
that the horror he conceiv'd at that sin had made him take that resolution. The King was so incens'd,
that he Commanded him to be cast to the Dogs, to be torn to pieces by them. The two
first that were brought would not meddle with him, but afterwards they got two English
Mastives, which upon the first setting on tore him to pieces.
               The Mahumetan Law allows them to be Luxurious,Polygamy allowed in Persia. not only by permitting Polygamy, but
also those other carnal enjoyments, wherein the chiefest part of their Beatitude consists, even
that which the Mussulmans of that Religion expect after this Life; it being their perswasion,
that, in their celestial Paradise, they shall not only have the same lawfull Wives they had in
this World, but that they shall also have as many Concubines and Servants, as they please, and
enjoy all other Women, as often as they have a mind to it.
               They use all imaginable inventions to stir themselves up to lust, and to this end have they, at
all meetings, whether at common Tipling Houses, or elsewhere, men and women Dancers, who
provoke them to brutality by their obscene postures. They use also the seed and leaves of Hemp,
to revive languishing Nature, though our Naturalists assign it a cold quality, which weakens
and corrupts Nature. I cannot imagine how this can add any fewel to their lustfull inclinations;
unless it be that the windy humour of it be also expulsive, or that in these hot Countries, it hath
other qualities, than it hath in Europe. To prepare this Drugg, they gather the leaves before
they come to Seed, dry them in the shade, beat them to powder, which they mix with Honey,
and make pills thereof, about the bigness of a Pidgeons Egg. They take two or three of them
at a time, to fortifie Nature. As to the Seed, they sry it, put a little Salt thereto, and eat it
by way of Desert. Imanculi, who was sent Ambassador from the King of Persia to the Duke of
Holstein, took of it at every meal, after he had married a young Woman at Astrachan, he himself
being seventy years of age. Persons of good repute, in Persia, will not eat of it, for they
say, that he who makes use of this remedy commits a greater sin, than he that had ravish'd his
own Mother upon Mahomet's Sepulchre. They call those who use it, Bengi kidi bengi. But
when all is done, the Persians think they have sufficiently expiated the sin of Fornication, when,
immediately after they have had their pleasure of a Woman, they either bath themselves, or
wash their Bodies all over with cold water.
               The charges the Persians are at in House-keeping,The Housekeeping of  Persins as to the Kitchin and the Cellar, amounts
to very little, unless it be in those Famalies where there are many Women, who inflame the
Bill very much. The Cotton-Cloath, which makes most of their Cloathing, is very cheap there.
Their Houses are but poorly furnish'd, and they think they have to spare, when the floor of their
Lodging Room is cover'd with Tapistry; and all the provision they make for the whole year,
is only Rice. Flesh is not dear, save only at those places, where the great number of Inhabitants
makes all Provisions scarce, in regard they are for the most part brought out of remote
Provinces. The Garden supplies them with a Desert, and the next Brook serves them for a Cellar.
They are very neat about their Rooms, and they suffer not Dogs, which out of some other
respects, they hold to be unclean Creatures, or any other Animals to come into them.
And whereas they have this inconvenience at meals that they use no Trenchers, they use a sort
of Pots which they call Tustahn, about the bigness of our Chamber-pots, setting one of them
between every two Persons; and into these they spet, and cast the bones, and parings of Fruits.
We have said elsewhere, that they have their Tennrs, or Stoves to keep them warm, and to
spare Wood as much as may be, nay some makes a shift to roast and boyl their meat with
them.
               In the Kitchin,Their Housholdstuff. they have Kettles and Pots of Brass, or of Copper tinn'd over, which are
commonly fasten'd to the Hearth, as also earthen pots. In many Provinces they are pretty well
stor'd with VVood; but there are others, where they have only Loppings, and many times
they are forc'd to warm themselves with Cow or Camels-dung, dry'd in the Sun. Their Dishes
are of Copper, but so handsomely made, and so well tinn'd over, that Silver Plate cannot
look better. Some have Porcelane, and the Country people are glad of earthen ware. As to

their meat, they do not care for much, as being satisfy'd with very little. Which is contrary
to what Bizarrus relates of them, to wit, that Butchers meat is dear in Persia, by reason of
the Gluttony of the Inhabitants, which, as he affirms, is so great, that aged persons there make
four meals a day, and consequently, with much more reason, the younger sort of people.
Nor does this agree neither with the account the antients give of them, who generally affirm
that the Persians were very temperate, and contented themselves with little Meat, but they
lov'd Fruits. Accordingly, during the aboad we made in Persia, I observ'd that one of their
chiefest Vertues was Temperance, and that the Persians seldome eat Flesh above once a day, and
that if they make another meal besides, it consists, for the most part, of Butter, Cheese, and
Fruits, though I must confess there are some who make two set meals.
               There is not any thing more ordinary in Persia than Rice soak'd in water.Their ordinary food is Rice. They call it Plau,
and eat of it at all their Meals, and serve it up in all their Dishes, especially under boild Mutton.
They some times put thereto a little of the juyce of Pomegranates or Cherries, and Saffron,
insomuch that commonly you have Rice of several Colours in the same Dish. They serve it up
also under Capons, and broild Fish. They also eat Sorrel, Spinage, and Cabbages, white and
green, but they do not much care for the red. They do not want small Birds, and they have all
sorts of Fowl in abundance, Turkeys only excepted, which are so scarce in this Country, that
a Georgian Merchant, having brought thither some of them from Venice, in the time of Schach-Abas,
he sold them at a Tumain, that is, near five pound sterl. a piece. Parridges and Feasants
are common, and, at those places where they are to be had, they may be bought cheap enough.
               Though Rice serves them instead of Bread,Which servs them for Bread, yet do they make some, of several sorts, of
Wheat also. The Komatsch are three fingers thick, and a foot and a half in length. The Lawasch
are round, and about the thickness of a man's finger. The Peasekssche, are half an Ell,
and they are bak'd in their Houses, over the Tenurs, on which they are set, and with the five
fingers of the hand, they make them as many Horns, whence they have their name. The Sengek
are made upon the pebbles, wherewith some of their Ovens are covered, so that this kind of
Bread or Cakes is uneven, and full of pits. The Iaucha is like Wafers, and as thinn as Parchment,
but in length and breadth they are half an Ell or better. The Persians use them instead of
Napkins, to wipe their fingers, wherewith they take up the Rice, and pull their Meat to pieces,
for you shall seldome see them use any Knives. When they have put the Iaucha's to this
use, they tear them into bits, put a little Rice or a Morsel of flesh into one of them, and so
swallow it down, or haply eat them without any thing with them. All their Spoons, even
the King's, are of Wood, made Oval-wise, at the end of a very small handle, but a foot and
a half in length.
               Their ordinary Drink,Their Drink??? especially that of the meanest sort of people, is water, into which
they sometimes put a little Duschab, and some Vinegar, For though Wine be cheap enough there,
especially in the Provinces of Erak, Aderbeitzan, ad Schiruan, where the measure,
which they call Lullein, and which contains near an English pottle, costs but six pence. Yet
are there many who make a difficulty to Drink thereof, because the use of it is forbidden by
their Law, especially the Hatzi, who are such as have gone on Pilgrimage to Meca, to Mahomet's
Sepulchre, and are to forbear it all their Lives after, out of a perswasion they are of,
that all their merits would be effac'd, by so enormous a sin. But such as are lovers of Wine,
and the common prostitutes, who have for the most part contracted a necessary habit of sinning,
Drink of it without any scruple, out of a presumption, that that sin will be pardoned them with
the rest, provided they do not make the Wine themselves. Whence it comes they make no great
entertainment, but they drink very freely of it. After meal, there is warm water brought in
for the washing of their hands.
               Opium,They tak Opium. which they call Offouhn, and Teriak, is commonly used among the Persians. They
make pills of it of the bigness of a Pea, and take two or three of them at a time. Those who are
accustomed thereto will take about an Ounce at a time. There are some who take of it only once
in two or three daies, which makes them sleepy, and a little disturbs their brains, so as that
they are as if they were a little entred in Drink. There is abundance of it made in Persia, especially
at Ispahan, and it is thus ordered. The Poppy being yet green, they cleave the Head of
it, out of which there comes a white Liquor, which being expos'd to the Air grows black, and
their Apothecaries and Druggists trade very much in it. All over the East they use this Drugg,
the Turks and Indians, as well as the Persians, insomuch, that Bellon saies, in his Observations,
that if a Turk hath but a peny, he will spend a farthing of it in Opium; that he saw above
fifty Camels loaden with it, going from Natolia into Turquey, Persia, and the Indies, and that
a Ianizary, who had taken a whole Ounce of it one day, took the next day two, and was
never the worse for it, save that it wrought the same effect in him as Wine does in such as take
too much of it, and that he stagger'd a little. It hath also this quality common with Wine, that
it does infuse Courage into those who have not much; whence it comes, that the Turks take of
it before they go upon any design. The Women do not ordinarily take any; but those who are
not able to bear with their untoward and imperious Husbands, and preferr Death before the

Slavery they live in, do sometimes make use of Opium, whereof they take a good quantity,
and, drinking cold water upon it, they, by a gentle and insensible Death, depart this World.
               There is hardly any Persian,They take Tobacco. what condition or quality soever he be of, but takes Tobacco.
This they do in any place whatsoever, even in their Mosqueyes. There grows abundance of it
near Bagdat, and in Kurdesthan, but they have not the art to Cure it as it ought to be, thinking
it enough to let it dry, as they do other leaves and Medicinal herbs. There are whole shops
full of it at Ispahan, being put up in Baggs, where it is reduc'd in a manner to powder, and is
at least as small as Sena. They highly esteem that which is brought them out of Europe, and call
it Inglis Tambaku, because the English are they who bring most of it thither. They are so great
lovers of it, that, when I gave a piece thereof to a Master, who taught me the Arabian Language
at Scamachie, he took it for an extraordinary kindness. To take it with any delight, they
make use of a Glass Flaggon, an Earthen Pitcher, a Cocos, or Indian Nut-shell, or a Kaback,
which is the rind of a certain sort of Citralls, or Cucumbers, which they fill half full of water,
or little more, and sometimes put a little perfum'd Waters into it. Into this water they
put a little hollow Reed, having at the end of it a Bole wherein they put the Tobacco with a
little Coal, and with another Pipe, about an Ell long, which they have in their Mouths, they
draw, through the water, the smoke of the Tobacco, which leaving in the water all its soot
and blackness, is incomparably more pleasant this way, than as we take it. Those who have
not all these conveniences are glad to take it our way; but their Pipes, which have Boles or
Heads of Earth or Stone, are of Wood, and much longer than ours.
               They Drink,Cahwa, or Coffee. with their Tobacco, a certain black water, which they call Cahwa, made of
a Fruit brought out of Egypt, and which is in colour like ordinary Wheat, and in tast like
Turkish Wheat, and is of the bigness of a little Bean. They fry, or rather burn it in an Iron
pan without any Liquor, beat it to powder, and boyling it with fair water, they make this
Drink thereof, which hath as it were the tast of a burnt Crust, and is not pleasant to the Palate.
It hath a Cooling quality, and the Persians think it allays the Natural heat. Whence it comes,
that they often drink of it, inasmuch as they would avoid the charge of having many Children,
nay they are so far from dissembling the fear they have thereof, that some of them have come to
our Physician for remedies of that kind. But he being a merry dispos'd Person, made answer,
that he would rather help them to get Children, than give them ought to prevent the getting
of them. I say the Persians are perswaded this water is able absolutely to smother all Natural
heat, and to take away the power of engendring; and to this purpose they tell a story of one
of their Kings, named Sulthan Mahomet Caswin, who Reign'd in Persia before Tamerlane's
time, that he was so accustom'd to the Drinking of Cahwa, that he had an inconceivable aversion
for Women; and that the Queen standing one day at her Chamber Window, and perceiving
they had got down a Horse upon the ground, in order to the Gelding of him, ask'd some
that stood by, why they treated so handsome a Creature in that manner; whereupon answer
being made her, that he was too Fiery and Metalsome, and that the business of those that were
about him, was, with the taking away of the excess of Metal, which Stone-Horses are guilty
of, to deprive him of all generative Vertue; the Queen reply'd, that that trouble might have
been spar'd, since the Cahwa would have wrought the same effect; and that if they would
keep the Stone-Horse with that Drink, he would, in a short time, be as cold as the King her
Husband.
               They affirm further, that the Son of that King, whom they also, after his Father, call
Mahomet, being come to the Crown, Commanded that great Poet, Hakim Fardausi, to give
him a piece of his Writing, and promis'd by way of reward to give him a Ducat for every
Verse. The Poet in a short time made sixty thousand, which are at this day accounted the best
that ever were made in Persia; but the King who expected not he should have made such haste,
sent him to those who had the over-sight of his Revenue, who judging this to be too great a
summ for a Poet, told him he must content himself with a less recompence. Accordingly they
brought it so low, that Fardausi made other Verses, wherein he reproach'd the King with his
avarice, and told him, the present he had made him, might be rather though to come from a
Porter than a Prince. Whereto he added, that Shooe-makers and Bakers were wont to do so,
and that he could not be perswaded that the King was of Royal Extraction, but must rather be
descended from some Shooe-maker or Baker.
               The King was so nettled at these reproaches, that he made his Complaints thereof to his Mother,
who presently imagining, that the Poet had made some Discoveries of her, ingenuously
acknowledg'd to her Son, that the King, her Husband, being become impotent through his
excessive Drinking of Cahwa, she fancied a Baker belonging to the Court, and that this Baker
was his Father; That she chose rather to take that course, than leave the Kingdom destitute of
Heirs; That he was now to consider, that had it not been for that Baker, he had not been at
all, and that he would do well to recompence the Poet, so as that the business might take no
further wind, lest the people should deprive him of a Crown which belong'd not to him. The
Son made his advantage of the advice and remonstrances of his Mother, and ordered the Poet
should have what he had promised him.
               
                  
We said before, that the Persians are great frequenters of the Taverns or Tipling-Houses,
which they call Tzai Chattai Chane, in regard there they may have The, or Cha, which the
Vsbeques Tartars bring thither from Chattai.The use of The, or Tea. It is an Herb which hath long and narrow leaves,
about an inch in length, and half an inch in breadth. In order to the keeping and transportation
of it, they dry it, so as that it turns to a dark grey Colour, inclining to black, and so shrivell'd
up, that it seems not to be what it really is: but as soon as it is put into warm water, it
spreads and reassumes its former green Colour. The Persians boyl it, till the water hath got a
bitterish taste, and a blackish colour, and add thereto Fnnel, Anniseed, or Cloves, and Sugar.
But the Indians only put it into seething water, and have for that purpose either Brass, or
Earthen pots very handsomely made, which are put to no other use. They drink it so hot, that
they are not able to hold their Dishes, which are of Porcelane or Silver, in their hands: whence
it comes, that they have found out a way of making them of Wood or Canes, done over with
a Plate of Copper or Silver Gilt, and sometimes of Gold, so as that the heat not being able to
penetrate them, they may hold them in their hands, even though the water were boyling. The
Persians, Indians, Chineses and Iaponneses assign thereto such extraordinary qualities, that,
imagining it alone able to keep a man in constant health, they are sure to treat such as come to
visit them, with this Drink, at all hours. The quality it is, by experience, found to have, is,
that it is astringent, and that it consumes superfluous Humours, which incommodate the Brain,
and provoke Drowsiness. They who have Written of the affairs of the Indies, as Maffeus,
Linschooten, Trigault, and others, tell Miracles of it: but this herb is now so well known in
most parts of Europe, where many persons of quality use it with good success, that it must needs
be known, what are both its good and bad qualities: which Dr. Tulp, a Physician of Amsterdam,
hath very strictly examined, in the last Chapter of the fourth Book, of his Medicinal Observations.
               The Persians live either on the Fruits which their Gardens bring forth, or by the advantage
they make by Tilling the ground. Some live by Traffick, others by their Trades; some to the
Warrs, and there are those who get their livelyhood by Writing. For since Printing is not yet
used amongst them, and that they stand in need of many Copies of their Alcoran, they have
them done by a sort of people, who do not only get a livelyhood thereby, but grow very rich,
inasmuch as a Copy of it well written: will yield eighteen or twenty Crowns. Whence it
comes, that there is no man that hath Children, but he teaches them to write, and yet there are
an infinite number of men in Persia who live only by writing.
               It is a pleasant sight, as a man passes over the Maidan, or through the Basar, to see the
Tradesmen of all Professions in their Shops, where they sell what they had made at their Houses;
for it is very seldome seen, that a Tradesman works in his Shop, which for the most part
is at some distance from the place where he lives, and confin'd to certain parts of the Marketplace,
where every Trade hath its distinct quarter, only for the selling of Commodities. The
most common Professions are Weavers, Dyers, and Painters, who paint Flowers upon the
Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, and sometimes even upon Brocadoe. The ordinary length of their
pieces of stuffs is not above five or six Ells, it being as much as needs for a Garment according to
their fashion. The fairest Stuffs, as well for Painting, as Workmanship, are made at Iescht
and Kaschan, where they represent upon Silk and Cotton, the figures of Persons, and particularly
VVriting,Where the best Stuffs are made??? and the Characters of their Language, so exactly done, that no Painter can do
things with such Life and Art. Using only what they spend themselves in Cloaths, they Trade
with the rest into other parts, with great profit, as they do also with unwrought Cotton and raw
Silk, whereof there are great quantities brought into Europe, through the Indies. As for the
Silk, it is worth in Persia not above 2s. 6d. or 2s. 8d. the pound. Their odinary weight is the
Badman, which is not the same in all places; in as much as, at Tabris, it weighs but six pound;
in Kilan, where they make use of the Schach badman, it is twelve; and at Scamachie and Karabath,
it is sixteen pounds.Persia yields yearly 20000. Balls of Silk. It is conceived that Persia produces every year, one with another,
ten thousand Somms, or twenty thousand Balls of Silk, every Ball weighing two hundred and
sixteen pounds. The Province of Kilan it self, in good years, yields eight thousand Balls;
Schiruan, three thousand; Chorasan, as many; Mesanderan, two thousand; Karabath, two
thousand. In which accompt we do not comprehend what Georgia, which is richer in Silk than
any other Province, produces within it self. They say, that all Persia does not spend above a
thousand Balls of Silk, and that the rest is sold into Turkie, the Indies, Italy, and to the English
and Dutch, who Trade at Ormus, and who bring thither Tinn, Copper, English and Dutch
Cloath, nay some Cloaths made at Berry (in France) and Saux, which the Persians, who
are not good at the ordering of VVoollen stuffs, do so highly esteem, that ordinary Cloath is
sold there at 20. or 24. Crowns the yard.
               The Armenian Merchants, who are Christians, are the richest of any, by reason of the
pains they take in making Voyages themselves, which is more than the other Persians do;
though both have an absolute freedome to Traffick where they please themselves, as Foreiners
have the liberty to come into Persia, and put off their Commodities there, paying custom; contrary
to what is observ'd in Muscovy, where the Subjects cannot go out of the Kingdom,

without the Czaar's express permission. There is also this particular advantage in Persia, as
well as Turkey, that the VVars do not obstruct their Commerce, the Caravans and other Merchants
having the same freedome to go to and fro,Trading not obstructed by the Wars. in the time of war, as they have in Peace, inasmuch
as both those Princes are equally concern'd to improve the advantages they make thereby.
The commerce of the Persians would be incomparably greater than it is, if they could make
their benefit of that which the Sea affords them, and if Navigation were as well setled there, as
it is in Europe.
               The Wars, which the King of Persia is oblig'd to carry on sometimes against the Turks, sometimes
against the Mogul and the Vsbeques Tartars, make him stand in need of a great number of
Souldiers. Those who are entertain'd into his Service have a setled pay at all times, as we shall
have occasion to speak more fully to anon.
               Having spoken of the Shops, the Cellars and the Kitchins of the Persians, I must not forget
their Chambers, and what belongs to them; nor yet their Marriages A Persian, who thinks
himself able to maintain several Wives, will seldome be content with one. Polygamy is an old
evil, deeply rooted in them. Strabo is of opinion, that they took several Wives, because
they would have many Children, and to get the reward which their Kings gave those who had
many Males. They are still willing enough to take the Wives, but not upon the same Motives,
since they use all the means they can to hinder their getting of Children. What they do now is
purely upon the accompt of pleasure, that their enjoyments may be heightned by the variety.
To this purpose, they have a Proverb, which says, that, to have a perpetual Spring, a man
must often change Wives, and use them as Almanacks, which serve but for a year. The Alcoran
permits the Mahumetans to marry as many Wives as they are able to maintain. Whence
it comes that rich Merchants, who are oblig'd to Travel up and down the Country, marry
Wives, and keep Houses in several places, that where ever they come they may be at home.
Yet do I not advise any man to believe those, who say, there is Law in Media, whereby
men are enjoyn'd to Marry at least seven VVives; nor yet what Niger says in his Geography,
that the Children kill their Father and Mother, when they are come to seventy years of age.
These are idle stories, which have no ground in the antient History, and whereto we found nothing
consonant in our time.
               It is not our design to dilate much upon the inconveniences of Polygamy; but certain it is,
that,The inconvenience of Polygamy. in Persia, there is but little friendship among the VVomen. Some love there may be between
them, but it is no doubt of that kind which comes near brutality. It is impossible also
that a Family, where there are so many women, can be free from jealousie, which is inevitable
among those, who would all be lov'd, and absolutely depend on him, who should, but
cannot, love them all equally. The Persians themselves, to express the inconveniences of Polygamy,
say in their Proverbs, that, as two Asses are more troublesome to be driven, than a
whole Caravan; so a Judge finds not so much difficulty in deciding the differences of a Province,
as a man distracted by two VVomen, who cannot live together without some jarring. VVe
were told several examples of the great mischiefs happening in Families through Polygamy, and
and among the rest one, concerning Silfaher, Chan of Scamachie. He was a Person of very
great Authority in the Country, and well look'd upon at the Court, where he had Married the
Sister of Schach-Chodabende, who was Father to Schach-Abas. This VVoman conceiving a
jealousie at the affection her Husband express'd towards another young Lady whom he had
Married, and imagining her quality would take away all Comparison between her and her Rival,
was so highly incens'd against him, that she resolv'd to be reveng'd; and to that purpose
writ to the King her Nephew, to bid him beware of her Husband, as having some design upon
his Person. Schach-Abas, who took the least suspicions for certain proofs, immediately
Commanded Kartschichai-Chan, Chan of Mesched, who was then about him at Ardebil, to
go and bring him Silfahar's Head. Kartschichai being come to the foot of the Mountain of Elbours,
in the Province of Schiruan, sent one to Silfahar, to desire him to come to him. Silfahar,
not fearing any mischief from the other, who was his intimate Friend, departed upon the
first summons, and coming late at Night to the place appointed him by the other, he set up his
Tent near that of Kartschichai. The next day Kartschicai getting up betimes in the Morning,
went to Silfahar, who was in Bed, and having awak'd and kindly saluted him, he desir'd him
to rise and take a VValk with him, for he had some affairs of great consequence to communicate
to him. But while Silfahar was putting on his Cloaths, Kartschichai, perceiving his soul
was in a quiet posture, in regard he was going to his Prayers, made a sign to his Servants,
who knew what they had to do, to dispatch him, and having caus'd his Head to be cut off, he
brought it to Court.
               It happened also, not long before our Travels into Persia, that one who kept a Tipling-house
at Ardebil, whose name was Schiritzi Aly, being Drinking very late with one of his Friends,
upon that Bridge of the City. which is called Heider Aly, saw coming towards him a loaden
Mule, which seem'd to look after a Master, while the true owner, who was a Merchant, was
gone to ease himself on the River side. Schiritzi had the good nature and charity to drive the

Mule to his own House, to unload it, and to turn him out again to look for his Mastet, who
coming immediarely into the City, met with his Mule in the streets, but discharg'd of his burthen.
He went and made his complaints to the Governour, who bid him name the person that
had robb'd him, and he would do him Justice. But the Merchant, not satisfy'd with this answer,
made his Case known to the King, who presently recommended him to Aliculi-Chan, with
express order to see the Merchants loss made good to him, to the full value he should set upon
his Commodities, inasmuch as the Chan had not been careful to secure the High-way, and
neglected to make an exact enquiry after the Thief; which order the Chan was forc'd to obey.
Schiritzi, on the other side, finding his Fortune much better'd by this unexpected Wind-fall,
and not thinking one Wife enough, Marries a second, which he took up out of the Brothelhouse,
but had no Children by her, By the former, he had a Son, who, one day coming from
School, and finding in the Chamber a Melon, whereof some part had been cut, presum'd to
take a piece of it, and by that means gave the young VVoman occasion to strike him. The
Child's Mother came into the Room, and reveng'd him, not only by fighting with her Rival,
but also by the complaints she made thereof to her Husband, representing to him the insolence
of that young VVoman, with so much bitterness, that being no longer able to endure her Language,
he gave her a good Cudgelling. The VVoman exasperated at that, went to the Chan,
and acquainted him with the Adventure of the Mule. The Chan immediately sent for the Taverner,
and having found him guilty of the Fact, order'd him to be hang'd. And whereas the
two Women had discover'd the Robbery, out of pure animosity and private resentments, rather
than out of any affection they had for the Governour, or regard of publick Justice, he caus'd them
to be publickly ravish'd, and banish'd them out of the City. The Taverners Son was sold,
and all his Fathers Estate confiscated to the use of the Governour, who lost nothing by the bargain.
               The Persians are not so scrupulous in their Contracts of Marriage, but that many times it
happens a Man Marries his Brother's VViddow;Incest tolerated. yet could I not learn, that Incests were so common
there as some Authors would have it believ'd, nor that the Son meddles with his Mother,
or the Brother with his Sister. Nay it cannot be found, that, before the Reign of
Cambyses, who fell in love with his own Sister, there was any talk of these incests
in Persia, no more than there was in Aegypt, before Ptolomey's time. There Marriages are
celebrated as followeth.
               When a young Man hath a mind to Marry,Their Ceremonies of Marriage, and hath heard of some person he can fancy, he
employs others to make enquiry into the qualities and disposition of the young Maid, inasmuch
as neither he nor any of his Relations are permitted to see her, and if upon the account he receives
of her by them, he finds his affections inclin'd to her, he makes a demand of her by two of
his Friends, who had been his God-fathers at his Circumcision, or, for want of those, by two
others of his Kinred. This first Embassy ordinarily finds no very kind reception, lest they
should imagine the Father to be over-forward to be rid of his Daughter. But if on the other
side, the young mans Friends find that his addresses are not taken amiss, they continue them,
and proceed to Articles, and agree upon the Dower, which, in these Countries, the Friends
of the Bridegroom, and not those of the Bride are to give. The Dower is to be either in Money,
which the young man sends to his Mistriss, some few dayes before the Marriage, as a recompence
to the Father and Mother for their Care in the Education of their Daughter; or he promises
her by the contract of Marriage, a certain sum of Money, or such a quantity of Silk, or
Stuffs, to be paid in Case of Divorce. These contracts are pass'd in the presence of the Kasi, or
the Molla who signs them. That done, they name on both sides certain persons to be as it
were Agents, who in the name of the betroathed parties, go to the Kasi, or Ecclesiastical
Judge, if it be in the City, or, if in a Village, to the Molla, who is empower'd by the Kasi to
that purpose, and who, being satisfy'd that all is done with the consents of the Kinred on both
sides, as also of the parties contracted, Marries them by the said Agents, in the name of God,
of Mahomet, and of Aly, delivering them a Certificate of the Marriage. This Ceremony is
for the most part, performed in private, the Kasi or Molla taking along with him the two Agents
into a private room, or haply into the fields, to some place where no people come, out of
a fear that some trick might be put upon the new Married couple, or some Witch-craft used upon
the Bridegroom. Whence it comes, that, when the Marriage is celebated in publick, before
the Kasi, as it often happens, (the Persians it seems, having the superstition to do actions of
this consequence according to their Observance of certain Constellations, which they think fortunate
or unfortunate to them) that the Judge may not be frustrated in the execution of his
Duty, they oblige all that are present, to stretch out their hands, that they may not be able to
do any thing of Witchcraft under their Garments. The Persian, whom we brought along with
us to Holstein, told us, that when he was Married, one of his Wife's Kinred cut a little piece of
blew Galoom-lace off his Garment, wherewith he made his enchantments, which made him
impotent for above two years and a half, till such time as having heard of a Sorcerer that liv'd
at Serab, who had the secret to dissolve those Charms, he went to him about it. This pretended

Sorcerer, or Magician, who was lame in both hands and feet, seeing him coming towards him,
told him he knew what was the occasion of his discontent, and that he should be eas'd of it, as
soon as he had taken a Nail out of a hole of a certain Wall, which he told him of, which when
he had done, he could perform the duty of a Married man as well as any other.
               Strabo affirms, that, heretofore, the Persians observed the Vernal Equinox as the fittest time
for their Marriages; but now they are absolutely indifferent as to the Season, and a man may
be Married on any day, save only in the Moneth of Ramesan, which is their Lent, and during
the ten dayes of the Aschur, when the Ceremonies performed in remembrance of the interment
of Hossein employ their Devotions; inasmuch as during that time, they allow not of any Divertisement
at all.
               The Wedding day being appointed, the young man sends, the day before, to his intended
Wife, Pendants, Bracelets and other Ornaments, suitably to their qualities, as also some
Dishes of Meat, to entertain the Relations and Friends, who are to bring the young Woman to
him: but neither of them both are present at the Dinner. In the Evening, towards Night, the
Bride is conducted, on Horse-back, or upon a Mule or Camel, cover'd with a Veil of Crimson
Taffata, which falls down below her Knees, accompany'd by her Kinred, and Musick, to the
Bridegroom's house. As soon as they are come to the House, they carry the Bride with her
Maids into one Chamber, and the Bridegroom with his Friends into another, and Supper is
brought up. Which ended, she is led to the Chamber where she is to lye, where the Bridegroom
comes to her, and then is it that he hath the first sight of her. The Bridegroom, who
find his Bride broken up to his hands, may lawfully cut off her Nose and Ears, and turn her
away; but Persons of quality, for the most part, think it affront enough to the Bride who is
no Maid, to send her and her friends immediately packing away. But if he really finds her a
Maid, he sends the tokens of it, by an antient Woman, to her Friends, and then they continue
their entertainments for three dayes together. After the first engagement, the Bridegroom gets
up from his Wife, and goes to his Friends, among whom he spends some hours in Merriment.
Persons of any Learning who come to these Entertainments, instead of Drinking, divert themselves
with their Books, which, to that end, they bring along with them, and spend the time in
discourses of Morality, or speculative Philosophy, which they do also at those other assemblies
which they many times appoint for that purpose. Their Poets are never wanting at these Feasts,
and contribute very much to the Divertisements thereof, especially the next day after the Wedding,
and the day after. Among other things, there is brought in, a great wooden Dish full of
Fruit, in the midst whereof there is a Tree, having on every branch Fruit and dri'd Conserves,
and if any one of the Company can take ought thence, so as that the Bridegroom perceives him
not, his slight is recompens'd with a Present, which the Bridegroom is oblig'd to make him:
but if he be surpriz'd therein, he must make good what he should have taken, a hundred fold;
They have also this custom, that if any one of the Company is not there the next day precisely
at the hour appointed for Dinner, he is laid upon a Ladder set against the Wall, with his Head
downwards, and Whipp'd on the soles of his Feet with a Handkercher roll'd about, till he redeems
himself.
               They have also Dancing; but the Men Dance by themselves, in one room, and the
VVomen by themselves in another room, into which the Musick comes not, but stand at the
Door.
               The next day after the Wedding, the Bridegroom washes himself, in the Winter time, in
Baths, which are very ordinary in those parts, and in the Summer, in the River, or next Brook;
but the Bride baths her self in the House. In the Evening they set before every one of the Persons
invited, upon a Handkercher of Flower'd Cotton-Cloath, two spoonfulls of Chinne, which
is the Drugg, wherewith they Colour their Nails and Hands. That done, the Guests make
their Presents. If they have taken a little more Wine than they can well bear, as it often happens,
they take up their Lodging at the House where they Supp'd; in regard the Watch which
is kept very strictly there in the Night, suffer not any to go in the Streets without a Lantern.
Those who find themselves well enough to go, give the Guard somewhat to Drink, and are
brought home to their Houses.
               I shall here take occasion to say something of the excellent order observ'd in all Cities of Persia,The Watch in the Night.
for the Guard. At Ardebil there are forty men, who incessantly walk about the Streets,
to prevent Mischiefs and Robberies, with such Vigilance and Exactness, that they are oblig'd
to Indemnify those that are Robb'd. Whence it came, that, at Ispahan, we came many times
after Midnight, from the Monastery of the Augustines, which was above half a League from
our quarters, yet never met with any mischief by the way: nay if at any time, as it might well
happen in that great City, we chanc'd to lose our way, the Guard would bring us with Torches
home to our very Doors. It is reported of Schach-Abas, that, desirous, one day, to make
tryal of the Vigilance of those people, suffer'd himself to be surpriz'd by them, and had been
carried to Prison, had he not been known by one of the Company, who discovering him to the
rest, they all cast themselves at his Feet, to beg his pardon. But he express'd himself well satisfy'd

with their care, and told them they had done but their duty; that he was King in the
day time, but that the keeping of the Publick peace in the night depended on them.
               If it happen, that, after the Marriage, the Bride be oblig'd to live at her Husband's Father's
House, it is not lawfull for her to appear before him with her Face uncover'd, much more to
speak to him, till such time as the Father-in-Law hath hir'd her to do it, and given her a new
Garment, or a piece of Stuff to make one, to oblige her thereto. But after all this, she must
not uncover her Face in his presence, nor yet her Mouth when she eats: for she hath a piece of
Cloath, which they call Iaschmahn, ty'd to her ears, so as that it hangs over her Mouth, to
hinder her from being seen eating.
               The Persians keep their VVives more in restraint than the Italians do, and suffer them not
to go to Church, or to any great Feast, unless their Husbands go along with them. If a VVoman
permit her Face to be seen, all the Apologies she can make for her self shall not clear her
from the suspicion conceiv'd of her Dishonesty, even though she granted that favour to one of
her Husband's nearest Relations. This reserv'dness they also observe in their Hoases, where
they are kept up as close Prisoners. VVhen any business obliges them to go abroad, it it be a
foot, they cover themselves with a white Veil, like a VVinding-sheet, which reaches down to
half the Legg, and if it be on Horse-back, they are dispos'd into a kind of Chests, or at least
muffle up their Faces, so as that it is impossible to see them.
               The Ceremonies we mention'd before are only for ordinary Marriages;Marriage for a certain time. but besides these,
there are two other kinds of Matrimony among the Persians, which are celebrated quite after
another manner. For those who are oblig'd to sojourn at other places besides those where their
ordinary Habitations are, yet are unwilling to take up their quarters in publick places, take
Wives for a certain time, allowing them a certain Salary, either for a Moneth, or such term
as they agree upon. They call this kind of Marriage Mitthe, and to dissolve it, there is no
need of Bills of Divorce, but the time of the contract being expir'd, it is dissolv'd of it self, unless
both parties are mutually content to prolong it. The third kind of Marrying is, when a
man makes use of a Slave, that he hath bought, and these Slaves are for the most part Christian
Maids, of Georgia, whom the Tartars of Dagesthan steal, to be afterwards sold in Persia. The
Children which they bear, as also those Born in the Marriage called Mitthe, share in the Fathers
Estate as well as the others, who have no other advantage of them therein, than what was
granted the Mother by her contract of Marriage: but they are all accounted lawfully begotten,
inasmuch as, after the example of the antient Egyptians, they look upon the Father as the principle
of Generation, and say, the Mother does only foment and feed the Child when it is once
conceiv'd; and upon the same accompt it is, that they affirm, that the Trees which bare fruit
are the Males, and that those which do not are the Females.
               When the Women are in Labour,The superstition of the Persians. and that they find some difficulty in the delivery, the
Kinred and Nighbours run to the Schools, and make a present to the Molla, to oblige him to
give his Scholars leave to play, or at least to pardon some one of them that hath deserv'd to be
severely punish'd; imagining that by the liberty they procure for those Scholars, the Woman
in Labour is eas'd, and will be the sooner deliver'd of her burthen. It is also out of the same
perswasion, that, in such Emergencies, they let go their Birds, and many times purposely buy
some, that they may give them their liberty upon such an occasion. They do the like for persons
in the agony of Death, who seem unwilling to dye. The Muscovites let go Birds when
they go to Confession; believing, that as they permit the Birds to fly away, so will God remove
their sins far from them.
               The men take an absolute liberty to see the Women when they please,They are jealous. but they allow not
their Wives the freedom of seeing so much as one man, so far are they from permitting them to
see any in private, so excessive is their jealousie. The offences Women commit contrary to their
faith plighted to their Husbands are unpardonable, nor indeed can they be guilty of any which
they will punish with greater severity, nay indeed cruelty. We were told an example of it,
that had happened in the Province of Lenkeran, in the time of Schach-Abas, who coming to
understand, that one of his Menial servants, who was called Iacupzanbeg, Kurtzi Tirkenan,
that is to say, he whose Office it was to carry the King's Bows and Arrows, had somewhat a
light Wife, sent him notice of it, with this message, that if he expected to continue at Court,
and to keep in his employment, it was expected he should cleanse his House. This message, and
the affliction he conceiv'd at the baseness of his Wife, and his reflection that it was known all
about the Court,Adultery cruelly punish'd??? as also that of the hazard he was in to lose his place, put him into such a fury,
that, going immediately to his House, he cut in pieces, not only his Wife, but also her two
Sons, four Daughters, and five Chamber-maids, and so cleans'd his House by the blood of
twelve persons, most of them innocent, that he might not be turn'd out of his employment.
The Law of the Country allows them to kill the Adulterer with the Woman, if they be taken
in the fact. These accidents are not very extraordinary among them, and the Judge recompences
with a new Garment the person who does an Execution of this Nature: which I conceive is
instead of the Salary which he is oblig'd to pay the common Executioner.
               
                  
Divorce is lawfull among them, and the dissolution of the Marriage is made before the Judge,
upon hearing of what both parties have to allege for themselves: for it is Lawful, not only for
the Men,Divorce lawful. but also for the Women to give Bills of Divorce, shewing good causes, not only for
Adultery, but also in several other Cases. Impotence, or Frigidity, rather declares the Marriage
null, than dissolves it; and Adultery is punish'd among them, as we mentioned before. We
were told a story of a VVoman, who, desirous to part from her Husband, charg'd him with
impotence. The Husband desir'd the Judge to command the Woman to scratch his Back;
whereto she reply'd, I have scratch'd thee so often, that I am weary of it, and thou wouldst never
scratch me where it most itch'd. Another complain'd of her Husband, that he would have done
his work in the wrong place, whereupon the Judge ordered her to be separated from him, and
the Husband to be Gelt. They Marry again after Divorce, as well Men as VVomen, with
this difference nevertheless, that the VVomen are oblig'd to continue in VViddow-hood three
moneths and ten days, not only that it may be known, whether they are with Child, but also
that they may have time to work their accommodation with their Husbands, if they have
any such desire. The Turks following the Doctrine of Hanife, have, in this particular, a very
brutish custom, in regard that, in Turquey, there may be a reconciliation made after the Divorce,
but when a man hath put away his VVife three several times, or, at her puting away,
says only the word Vtzkatala, that is to say, I renounce thee thrice, he cannot take her again,
unless he permit the Molla to name some person, who is to lye with her before hand in her
Husbands presence, so as that he may be assur'd he hath done his work with her. I should not
set down a thing so extravagant, had I not inform'd my self of the truth thereof from Persons
of quality, either Turks born, or such as have liv'd several years at Constantinople, who have
all assur'd me, that, of sixty two Sects, whereof the Turkish Religion consists, many have
this Custom, nay what is more, that they give Money to those who do them that good office.
There are some indeed who think it sufficient to put a-Bed with their VVives a young Lad, that
is not able to perform the work of Matrimony, which they do only for form sake, thereby to
reconfirm the Marriage.
               To this purpose,A pleasant story. there is a Story, that during the time there was no other Religion allow'd
in Sulthania, but the Turkish, though there was a great number of persons who profess'd the
Persian Religion; the Sulthan, being one day incens'd against his Wife, said to her the word
Vtzkatala, so that being oblig'd by the Law to give her a Bill of Divorce, he immediately repented
of it, and not willing that another should make use of her, in order to his having of her
again, he ask'd his Ecclesiasticks whether there were not any Iman, who could dispence with
the severity of that Law. Whereto the Mufti, and the other Turkish Priests having return'd
their answer, that that Law was indispensable, he would needs hear what a certain Molla, named
Hassan Raschi could say in the business. This man was a Persian Born, and had the reputation
of a Jeaster, and one that made sport with things most serious, insomuch that there had been
no great notice taken of his affirming, that he knew an Iman, who would certainly dispense
with the Sulthan, had it not been for the passionate desire this latter had to take his Wife again,
wherein he was so earnest, that he hearkned to any advice was given him to that purpose. Hassan
came to see him; but instead of leaving his shooes behind him in the Antichamber, according to
the custom of the Persians, he brought them in under his arm. The Sulthan perceiving him
coming in that posture, ask'd him the reason of it, and whether he were afraid his shoos might
be stollen. Hassan made answer, that he was not afraid of any such thing, but only that he was
unwilling any other should put on his shoos, expressing thereby, that the Sulthan should not
permit another to lye with his Wife. Whereto he added, that in the time of Mahomet, some
body had done the Hanife the afront to take away his shoos. The Turkish Priests, who were
present at this discourse, laugh'd at him, and said, that if he had no better reasons to allege, to
satisfie the Sulthan, that he might take his Wife again, he might go his wayes, in as much as
Hanife had not liv'd in the time of Mahomet, but long after. Hassan Kaschi, making his advantage
of this answer, reply'd; If it be so, said he, that Hanife liv'd not in the time of Mahomet,
nor you neither, and that in the whole Alcoran there is not a word to be found of this
infamous Law, how can you tell whether Mahomet had any such intention? And how can
you impose this burthen upon the people? He thereupon cited the exposition of Saduk, Hanife's
Master, upon the Alcoran, and made it appear, that a Husband hath the power, not only
to give his Wife ill words, and to threaten her, but also to beat her, yet it shall not be in her
power to forsake him, for his so doing. This reason, which suited with the Sultan's design,
pleas'd him so well, that he not only took his Wife again, but he also profess'd the Persian Religion,
and either put to Death or Banish'd all the Turkish Priests.
               They relate another pleasant Story to the same purpose;Another story. to wit, that Solyman, Emperour
of the Turks, being one day angry with his Wife, did, in the heat of his passion, pronounce
the Vizala against her. He soon repented him of it, in regard his Wife, being one of the handsomest
Women in the VVorld, it went to his very soul to part with her; and it being not in
his power to take her again, till such time as she had pass'd through another man's hands, he

bethought him, the only way were to have er Bedded by a Dervis, of the Sect of those, whom
they call Dervis Rastkeli, who were in so great repute for their sanctity and austerity of Life, that
he had not the least fear he wouldmedde with her. It is to be observ'd by the way, that he, who
thus lies with the VVife, is before solemnly Married to her, and when he hath done his work,
is Divorc'd from her, otherwise it were adultery. Soliman then, having concluded the Mariage
between his VVife and the Dervis, ordered them to go to Bed together: but they gave one
the other such mutual satisfaction, and ere they came out of the Bed, were so well agreed, that
the next day, they declar'd, that they had an affection one for the other, and that they would
not be separated; so that, it being not in the power of the Law to force them to a Divorce,
Solyman was forc'd to let him enjoy his VVife, who went along with her Husband into Persia,
where he setled himself very well, by the means of his VVife, who had great VVealth.
               It must needs be,The Education of their children. that, of so many VVomen, there are Born a great number of Children.
Accordingly there are some Fathers have 25. or 30. But the modern Education of them differs
much from that of the antients; in as much as now they are not brought up by VVomen, and
the Fathers put them not out till they come to such an age, as they did antiently, when they
admitted them not to their presence till they were four years of age, according to Strabo, or five,
according to Herodotus, or seaven, according to Valerius Maximus. Nor do they now, as
heretofore, exercise them in Shooting and Riding; but they are put, very young, either to
VVork, or to School, to learn to VVrite and Read; there being very few Persians who cannot
do both.
               Their Metzid, or Mosqueies, where they say their Prayers, serve them also for Schools.
No City but hath as many Metzids as Streets, every street being oblig'd to maintain a Metzid,
with the Molla belonging to it, who is as it were the Principal of the College, and the Calife,
who is the Regent. The Molla sits in the middle of the form or Class, and the Scholars all
about him,Their Authors for reading. all along the VValls. As soon as they begin to know the Characters, they put
them to read certain Chapters taken out of the Alcoran, and afterwards the whole Alcoran.
Then they put them into the Kulusthan, or the Rose-Garden of Schich Saadi, and his Bustan,
or Orchard, and at last into Hafis, who set out the Bustan in Rime. These last Authors, who
were both of Schiras, which is the antient Persepolis; where the Language is more pure than
in any other place of Persia, are highly esteem'd, as well for the Excellency of their Style, as
the Praegnancy of their Inventions. The Children read very loud, and all at the same time,
the same Text, moving themselves all with the same agitation from one side to the other, much
after the manner that the VVind shakes Reeds.Their Writing. They all write upon their knees where ever they
are, or what age soever they be of, in regard they have not the use of either Stooles or Tables.
They make their Paper of old rags, as we do, which for the most part are of Cotton and Silk,
and that it may not be hairy or uneven,Their Ink. they make it smooth with a Polishing stone, or sometimes
with an Oyster or Muscle shell. They make their Ink of the rinds of Pomegranates, or of
Galls and Vitriol, and to make it thick, and more fit for writing, their Characters requiring
a full Body, they burn Rice or Barley, beat it to powder, and make a hard paste of it, which
they dissolve with Gum-water, when they go to write. The best comes from the Indies,
which though it be not all equally good and fine, is yet very fit for their Pens, which are not
made of Goose-quills,And Pens. as ours in Europe are, in regard they would be too hard for their Paper,
which, being of Silk or Cotton, is very tender, but they make them of Canes, or Reeds, and a
little bigger than our Pens. They are of a dark Colour without, and they are brought for
the most part from Schiras, or from the Gulf of Arabia, where there grows abundance of
them.
               The Persians have their particular Language,The Persian Language. which hath much of the Arabian, but nothing
at all of the Turkish. There are in it also many forein words, as Germane and Latine, insomuch
that it might be thought these Languages have the same Original, if it were not found, that it
happen also in almost all the rest, yet not so as that it may be thence inferr'd that all these Nations
come from the same source. To signifie, Father, Mother, a Tooth, a Pen, a Rat, a Yoak.
they have the same words with the Latine; the ne and tu are Latin and Persian words; and du,
no, de, signifie two, nine, and ten: yet is it not to be concluded thence, that the Persians are originally
Romans. True it is, that the Persians come from the Scythians, as do also the Germans;
yet would I not affirm, that the antient Goths and modern Tartars are the same people.
It must therefore be granted, that the modern Language of the Persians differs much from the
antient, if what Herodotus says be true, that all their words ended in S; though it may be
withall confess'd, that they have all a full termination, inasmuch as they have in a manner all
the accent upon the last Syllable. It is easie enough to be learnt, as having but few irregular
Verbs, and if it be true, that it is the same Language which was spoken antiently, the examples
of Themistocles and Alcibiades make it appear,The Persians learn the Turkish Language. that it may be attain'd in a short time. All
that is hard in it is the Guttural pronunciation thereof.
               Most of the Persians, with their own Language, learn also the Turkish, especially in those
Provinces which have been long under the Jurisdiction of the Grand Seignour, as Schiruan??? Adirbeitzan,

Erak, Bagdat, and Eruan, where Children are taught the Turkish Language, and
by this means, it is so common at Court, that a man seldome hears any one speak the Persian;
as in the Grand Seignor's Court, they ordinarily speak the Sclavonian, and in the Mogul's, the
Persian. But in the Province of Fars, which is the antient Persia, and at Schiras, they speak
only the Persian Language. They understand nothing of the Hebrew, Greek, or Latin; but
instead of these Languages, wherein the Europaeans study the Sciences, they have the Arabian,
which is to them as the Latin is to us; in regard the Alcoran, and all its Interpreters make use
of it, as do also all those who write any Books of Philosophy and Physick. So that it is not to
be much admir'd,Their Characters. that it is so common, that indeed they cannot express their own Language,
but in Arabian Characters.
               'Tis true,Their Vniversities. the Sciences are not improv'd to that perfection by them as they are by the Europaeans,
yet can it not be said but that the Persians are much addicted to Study, and they call
their Learned men Filosufs. To this end they have their Colleges, or Universities, which they
call Medressa, and the Professors who teach in them, Mederis. Their most eminent Colleges
are those of Ispahan, Schiras, Ardebil, Mesched, Tabris, Caswin, Kom, Iescht, and Scamachie,
which are all under the superintendency of the Sedder, or chief of their Religion, who is
oblig'd to take care for their allowances and maintenance. This is done out of the Revenue of
those Provinces which pay no Taxes to the King, as Kochtzeh, near Eruan, Vtuathzuk, near
Karabath, Tabakmelek, between Georgia and Karabath, Agdasch, and Kermeru.
               They have a particular inclination for Arithmetick, Geometry, Eloquence, Poetry, Natural
and Moral Philosophy, Astronomy, Astrology, Law, and Medicine, in regard they make
some advantage of the Profession of these Sciences. They have all Aristotles Philosophy in the
Arabian Language, and call it Dunja piala, that is to say, the Goblet of the World; with this
remark upon it, that as a man Drinking out of a great Bowl moderately, finds himself the better
for it, and taking so much of it that he is Drunk therewith, he both injures his Body and
disturbs the Mind; so is a man to make a temperate use of the Philosophy of Aristotle, and,
not deboysting himself, observe a Mediocrity in the Study thereof. Children are taught Arithmetick
in the Schools with their VVriting and Reading. In their accompts, they commonly
make use of the Indian figures; but the more Learned use the Arabian Characters.
               They joyn Eloquence and Poesy together, and comprehend these two Sciences under a very
few precepts: which bring a man in a short time to the practick part thereof. And indeed most
of their Eloquent pieces, which they embellish with abundance of Histories, and Moral Sentences,
are in Verse.
               For the excellency of their Language,Their best Authors. Pregnancy of conceit, and Elegance of expressions,
they read the Kulusthan of Schich Saadi, whom they prefer before all their other Authors. It
is a very Eloquent piece, though in Verse, full of figures and enrich'd with History, and Maxims
of Policy and Morality. Accordingly, there is not any one almost, but hath this Book;
nay some have perus'd and studied it so much, that they have it by Heart, and apply the Passages,
Sentences, and Comparisons thereof, in their ordinary Discourse, so pertinently, that it is no
small pleasure to hear them talk. They are also great Lovers of History, and delight much in reading
the Lives and Deaths of their Prophet Aly and his Son Hossein, who was kill'd in the VVar
against Iesied; which pieces are written in a style truly Historical, and of a noble height. They have
also several other Histories, and Chronicles, Ecclesiastical and Prophane, of the Lives and
VVars of their Kings; and some, of the affairs of other forein Nations: the best whereof are
those of Mirchond, Enweri, Zami, Walchi, Nussegri, and others. The best of all their Historians
is Mirchond, who hath written the History of Persia, in excellent good Language, in
several great Volumes, and it is a piece so highly esteem'd, that it is worth in the Country
above two hundred Crowns; and therefore I cannot think it can be had perfect in Europe, though
I know, that Golius, Professor of the Oriental Languages and the Mathematicks in the University
of Leyden, hath most of it, with several other excellent Books of that Nature. But there
is not any man, I know of, that hath so much of it, and makes so great advantages thereof, as
the incomparable Monsieur Gaulmin, Counsellor of State, and the Senior of the Masters of
Requests, who though he hath the best Library in Europe, for Books of this Nature, yet must it
be acknowledg'd, that he is so perfect a Master of all the Oriental Languages, that he needs not
be oblig'd for ought he can learn out of any of these Authors.
               I do not give this accompt of their Histories, that a man should give any great credit thereto,
especially when they speak of their Religion and Saints. For in Persia, as well as elsewhere,
they have their pious frauds, and think it a kind of Piety to establish and improve the errors of
their Religion, by Fables and Impostures: since that even in their profane Histories, they take
that freedom which is only allow'd Poets and Painters, as may be seen particularly in the History
of Alexander the Great, which they have so disguis'd, that it hath no Consonancy to
what is written of him by Q. Curtius, Plutarch, and Arrianus. But though it be not true,
yet it is Divertive enough, at least to excuse, if not deserve, this little Digression.
               
                  
They say then that Iscander (so they call Alexander the Great) was Born in Iunahn, that
is to say, Greece; that his Father's name was Betlimus, and that his Mother was the Daughter
of King Tzimschid,A fabulous History of Alexander the Great. who was the Son of Keikobath. They say Tzimschid liv'd seven hundred
years; That he was the wisest of all the Kings that ever Reign'd, and that he is to be acknowledg'd
the Inventor of Saddles, Horse-shooes, Bows, Painting, Tents, and Wine. That the
education of Alexander was committed to Aristotle, who knew so well how to ingratiate himself
with his Disciple, that being extreme unwilling to be without him, he oblig'd him to go
along with him in his first Wars, wherein he made great advantages of his advice. For Alexander
being as yet but fifteen years of age, bethought him one day to ask Aristotle, to whom all
Greece belong'd, whereto being answer'd by him, that his Grand-father by the Mother-side
had heretofore been Master of it, he, extremely troubled to find himself depriv'd of so great a
Kingdom, resolv'd upon the Reduction and Conquest of it, and afterwards to wage a War
against all the World. To that end, he went, with his Tutor, to Stampul, or Constantinople,
and made proffer of his service to the King there. Aristotle, who was one of the most
Eloquent men of his time, knew so well how to recommend the excellent endowments of Alexander,
that the King trusted him with the conduct of an Army, wherewith he Conquer'd Egypt,
and all the neighbouring Provinces. Afterwards, he conducted that Army against those of the
Hebbes, who still made opposition, and making their advantage of their Elephants, rendred all
Alexander's attempts fruitless, till Aristotle advis'd him to rub over with Nefte a heap of Reeds,
to set them a-fire, and to cast them among the Elephants, which were so startled at the fire,
that they were put into disorder, whereupon the Hebbes were defeated, and forc'd to submit.
Thence he went to Sengebat, the Inhabitants whereof have great Lips, and very long Teeth.
Their King, with some of his people, got into a Tower, where Alexander would have besieg'd
him. But Aristotle told him, that being Master of the City, he had cut off the Root of that
Tree, and that it would not be long ere he saw him fall without any further trouble. He took
his advice, and went thence to Iemen, and Conquer'd all Arabia. He went afterwards to
Aleppo, Erserum, Diabek, going on still along the River Tigris, as far as Mosel, and thence
fell down into Georgia, reduc'd all to his Subjection, and came at last to Berde, in the Province
of Iran. In this City, there lived at that time the Widdow of a certain King, named Melkchatun,
who hearing daily of the great wonders done by Alexander, employ'd several Painters, to
take his Picture, as also those of all the great Men of her time; insomuch, that Alexander going
disguiz'd, and in the quality of an Ambassador from Alexander, to give her a Visit, the
made a shift to discover him, and invited him to Dine with her. But instead of Meat, there
were brought up only great Basins full of Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones, which she desir'd
him to fall to and to make the best Cheer he could: whereupon Alexander telling her, that
there was not any thing could satisfie his hunger, she represented to him, that it was for those
useless trifles that he ruin'd so many Provinces and fruitfull Countries, such as were able to
produce what could maintain many Millions of People, and shew'd him, how that when he
had Conquer'd all the World, he must at last dye for want of Bread, if he still continu'd
the courses he then took, and intreated him not to deprive her of her Kingdom. Alexander
did as she desired; and they talk to this day of the great Wisdom of that Queen, of
whom they relate among other things, that, being very Rich, she did not impose
pecuniary Mulcts upon offenders, but oblig'd them to make Graves for the Burial of the Dead,
and they say there are yet many of those made by her Command to be seen near Nechtzuan.
That thence Alexander went to Schiruam, and built the City of Derbend, causing it to be fortify'd
on the side towards Persia, and drawing a wall all along the Mountain as far as the black
Sea, and building Towers at a League distance one from another, for Guards against the Invasion
of the Tartars. That afterwards, he went into Persia, became Master of almost all the
Provinces thereof, and engag'd against Darius, who was then, with an Army of two hundred
thousand men, in the Province of Kirman. That Darius had the advantage in the three first
Battels, but was defeated in the fourth. Alexander having drawn the Enemie's Army to a place
where he had caus'd several pits to be made, which he had covered with straw, and that Darius
was taken in one of them. Afterwards, he went into Chorasan, and thence into the Indies,
where, upon the intreaty of the Indians, he caus'd to be made a Palizado of Iron against the
Pigm??es, which is to stand till the day of Judgment. Afterwards, he defeated the Vsbeques,
and after that, he turn'd his Arms against the Hebbes, who rebell'd against him. That having so
many Kings in his power, he would needs be advis'd by Aristotle, whether it were not the safest
way to put them to Death. But Aristotle having represented to him, that some of their Children
might come to revenge that cruelty, he set them all at Liberty, except Darius, whom he
poyson'd. After this, Alexander coming to understand, that, in the Mountain of Kef, there
was a great Cave, very black and dark, wherein ran the water of Immortality, would needs take
a Journey thither. But being afraid to lose his way in the Cave, and considering with himself,
that he had committed a great over-sight, in leaving the more aged in Cities and fortify'd places,
and keeping about his Person only young people such as were not able to advise him, he

ordered to be brought to him some old Man, whose counsell he might follow in the adventure
he was then upon. There were in the whole Army but two Brothers, named Chidder and Elias,
who had brought their Father along with them, and this good old Man bid his sons go and tell
Alexander, that to go through with the design he had undertaken, his only way were, to take
a Mare that had a Colt at her heels, and to Ride upon her into the Cave, and leave the Colt
at the entrance of it, and the Mare would infalliby bring him back again to the same place
without any trouble. Alexander thought the advice so good, that he would not take any other
person with him in that Journey but those two Brothers, leaving the rest of his Retinue at the
entrance of the Cave. He advanc'd so far, that he came to a Gate, so well polish'd, that, notwithstanding
the great darkness, it gave light enough to let him see there was a Bird fasten'd
thereto. The Bird ask'd Alexander what he would have? He made answer, that he look'd for
the water of Immortality. The Bird ask'd him, what was done in the World? Mischief enough,
replies Alexander, since there is no Vice or Sin but Reigns there. Whereupon the Bird getting
loose and flying away, the Gate opened, and Alexander saw an Angel sitting, with a Trumpet
in his hand, holding it as if he were going to put it to his Mouth. Alexander ask'd him his
name. The Angel made answer, his name was Raphael, and that he only staid for a command
from God to blow the Trumpet, and to call the Dead to Judgment. Which having said, he
ask'd Alexander, who he was? I am Alexander, repli'd he, and I seek the water of Immortality.
The Angel gave him a Stone, and said to him, go thy wayes, and look for another
stone of the same weight with this, and then thou shalt find Immortality. Whereupon Alexander
asked, how long he had to live? The Angel said to him, till such time as the Heavens and
the Earth which encompass thee, be turn'd to Iron, or as others say, into Gold and Silver.
Alexander being come out of the Cave, sought a long time, and not meeting with any stone
just of the same weight with the other, he put one into the Balance which he thought came very
near it, and finging but very litrle difference, he added thereto a little Earth, which made the
Scales even; it being God's Intention to shew Alexander thereby, that he was not to expect
Immortality, till he himself were put into the Earth. At last, Alexander having, one day, a
fall off his Horse, in the barren ground of Kur or Ghur, they laid him upon the Coat he wore
over his Armour, and cover'd him with his Buckler, to keep off the heat of the Sun. Others
affirm, that this Coat was Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and that his Buckler was cover'd
with Plates of the same Mettal, and that then he began to comprehend the Prophecy of the Angel,
and was satisfy'd the hour of his Death was at hand, that accordingly he dyed, and that
his Body was carried into Greece.
               They add to this Fable, that these two Brothers, Chidder and Elias, drunk of the water of
Immortality, and that they are still living, but invisible, Elias, upon the earth, and Chidder,
in the Water, wherein this latter hath so great power, that those, who are in danger of being
destroy'd by water, if they earnestly pray, saying, Ia Chidder Nebbs, vowing a Sacrifice or
Offering to him, and firmly believing, that he can relieve them, shall escape the danger, and
save their Lives. Whence it comes, that, if any one perish, it is attributed to his Incredulity???
but if he escape, they are of a certain perswasion, that it is by the assistance of Chidder, to whom
those who escape Shipwrack, or any other danger upon the Sea, do every year, upon the same
day, give solemn thanks, and acknowledge the protection of this Saint. These Ceremonies are
performed in February, and those who keep the Vows they have made upon such occasions, invite
their Friends to a Supper, both Men and Women, relate to them the particulars of the
dangers they had been in, and how they were deliver'd out of them, by the means and assistance
of Chidder. Then they Sup together, and make good Cheer, but drink no Wine. In the mean
time, they serve up into another Room, several Dishes of Fruit and Conserves, and in the
midst of the room, they set in a Wooden Dish, full of Pease-Meal, a Wax-Candle lighted,
and as they go out of the room, they say, Chidder Nebbi, if this offering be acceptable to thee,
shew it by some sign. If, the next day, they find the track of any ones having been in the room,
or the print of a hand in the Meal, it is accounted a very good sign, and the Friends have another
meeting, to spend that day in Merriment. Whence it comes, that the Women, who are
not often admitted to these Feasts, find out ways to get into the Room, so as that they are not
perceiv'd, and take away a handful of the Meal, that the Feasting may be continu'd. The
Nassara, who are a sort of Christians, of Armenia, do also celebrate this Festival, but they
drink Wine thereat, which the Persians do not. We were told at Ardebil, that one day, a
Woman making her advantage of this Feast, had lock'd up her Gallant in the room where they
had prepar'd the entertainment for the Prophet. She went ever and anon to see him, and perceiv'd
not that a Child of hers, about four four years of age, follow'd her, who seeing a strange
face, fell a crying, so loud, that the Gallant took an Apple out of the Fruits design'd for Chidder,
and gave it the Child to make him hold his peace. But as soon as the Child had got the
Apple, he runs into the Hall, where he shew'd his Father the present, which Chidder Nebbi
had made him. The Father not knowing what to think of that Vision, and derous to see whether
Chidder was become visible, went into the room, and there found a man in a posture that

a little startled him. But the Gallant, fearing they would have Sacrifiz'd him to the Prophet,
made a shift to get away, and the Woman, pretending she had not seen any thing, it pass'd for
a certain apparition of Chidder.
               Ther's no Nation in the world more addicted to Poetry than the Persians.The Persians inclin'd to Poetry. There you have Poets
in all the Market-places, and in all Houses of good fellowship, where they entertain and
make sport for such as frequent them, as the Mountebanks, and such as shew tricks of Legerdemain
do in Europe. All bear with them, and the Great Lords think they cannot give their
Friends a better entertainment, than by Diverting them, while they are at Dinner, with the recital
of some Poem. The King himself, and the Chans have, among their other Menial Servants,
their Poets, whose only business it is to find out somewhat for their Diversion by whom
they are maintain'd, and which they are not to communicate to any other, without the consent
of their Patrons. The Poets are known from others by their Habit, which is the same with
that of the Philophers; to wit, a long white Coat, but open before, with great broad Sleeves,
and they have at their Girdle a kind of a Hawking-bag, in which are their Books, Paper, and an
Ink-horn, that they may give Copies of their verses to such as desire them. Their under Garment
hath no Sleeves, and would be a perfect Cloak, if it had but a Cape. They wear no
Stockings; their Breeches come down to their feet, like Pantaloons, and in winter, they
wear such as reach but to their ankles. Instead of Mendils or Turbants, they wear a kind of
Caps. Those who put off their Productions in the Market places and at Taverns, wear Skarfs
of several Colours, which come about their Bodies just above the waste, and passing over the
right shoulder fall down under the left arm, Most of these take for the Subject of their Poetry
the Religion of the Turks and their Saints, which they are pleas'd to rail at and make sport
withall.
               It may well be imagin'd, that, among so many Poets, there must also be some Poetasters, and
that there, as well as in other places, a man must expect to find but few Homers and Virgils.
Nay there are some so modest as to vent only the works of other Men, and finding in themselves
such a barrenness of wit as will not produce any thing, make it their business to disperse
their productions who are in repute. Persia hath this common with France, as indeed it hath
many other things, that it hath hardly any Author excellent at an Epick Poem, and that some
few Poets laid aide, who are in great reputation, the rest are rather to be pittied. The best,
and such as may justly be accounted good Poets,The best Persian Poets. are Saadi, Hafis, Firdausi, Fussuli, Chagani,
Eheli, Schems, Naway, Scabidi, Ferahsed, Deheki, Nessimi, &c. Their Poetry is suitable to the
modern way, and they will keep up the Rime, though they are not very exact in observing the
number of the Syllables. Nor do they think it much to use the same words to keep the Rime,
as imagining it no breach of the Rules of their Prosodia; as for example in the following Verses:

                     Tziri, tziri, Tziragh Iani tze?
                     Adamir a demagh Iani tze?
                     Tziri, tziri, tziragh es teri bud,
                     Adamira demagh cheri bud.
                  
               
               Where the Poet makes a pretty allusion between the words Teri and Cheri, whereof one signifies
moist, and the other, of or belonging to an Ass. The sense of the Verses, is to this effect;
Why does the Candle go out? Why does man boast and is vain-glorious? because the one wants
moist Suet, and the other is troubled with Asse's fat. They also delight much in Equivocations,
and many times very handsomely begin the subsequent Verse with the word that ended the precedent,
as in the following Example.
               
                  Kalem be dest, debiran behes hasar derem
                  Derem be dest nea Ied meker nauk Kalem.
               
               Their Study of the Law can be of no great extent,Their Law. in regard they have but few Laws, and
those they have are all taken out of the Alcoran, and the Commentaries upon it: which the
Kasis and the Divanbegs observe, in the decision of differences. They have besides these, certain
Local customs, but very few.
               In Physick,Medicine. or Medicine, they follow the Maxims of Avicenna, and their Physicians are all
Galenists. Phlebotomy is not very ordinary among them, but they administer continual Medicines
made of Herbs and Roots, and many times apply Fomentations and other outward remedies.
They have nothing of Anatomy, and their practice is so gross, that, when I was at
Scamachie, where our Physician was intreated to visit a Man, who, having drunk too much Aquavitae,
lay a dying, I saw a Moor-Physician, who had the sick party in hand, order a great
piece of Ice to be laid on his Stomack, maintaining his proceedure by this general Maxim, that
a Disease is to be Cur'd by what is contrary thereto. When Women or Children are troubled
with any Disease or Indisposition, they do not send for a Physician, but for the Midwife, whence

it comes that Midwives have some skill in Medicine. The Books which treat thereof,
have this extraordinary, that, the remedies they prescribe, are as fit for Horses as
Men.
               Our Physician, who had joyned to Galen's method certain Maxims of Paracelsus, and us'd
Chymical remedies with very good success, grew so famous in Persia, that the King himself
proffer'd him very considerable allowances, to engage him to continue in that Court. Nay,
he grew into such repute, after he had recover'd some persons who had been given over by
others, that the people began to look upon him as an extraordinary man, insomuch that they
brought to him some that were lame and blind from the Birth, to recover their limbs and sight
who never had had them.
               It is not of late that the Persians have apply'd themselves to the study of Astronomy.Astronomy. Heretofore
they who made profession thereof were called Magi, and now they call them Minatzim,
and they do not busie themselves so much in observing the motions of the Heavens and
Stars, and the pure contemplation of that Science, as in Prognosticating the effects which their
influences may produce, and to fore-tell those things, the contingency whereof they imagine to
themselves may be read in the course of the Heavens. So that it is rather Judiciary Astrology,
than Astronomy that they now Study, in regard the one would bring them no advantage at all,
whereas the other is the more beneficial to them in this respect, that most of the Persians have
this superstition, that they never undertake any thing of consequence, but they first consult the
Minatzi. To that end, the King and Great Lords have alwayes one of these about them,
who perpetually observes the Heavens, and fore-tells whether the time be fortunate or unfortunate
for the business they would undertake. And out of that reflection it is, that they say
themselves, that Astrology, who is dependent on Astronomy, is a rich Daughter, but comes
from so poor a Mother, that she is forc'd to preserve her Life, from whom she receiv'd her
own. These Astrologers are never without their Astrolabe, which they carry in their Bosoms,
that they may erect a Scheme at any time: but their skill is not great about Nativities, especially
those of persons of mean condition; which proceeds hence, that, having no Clocks, they
cannot get the precise hour, much less the minute of the Birth, which great persons have exactly
observ'd, by means of the Astrolabe.
               For the teaching of Astronomy they have neither Sphear nor Globe, insomuch that they
were not a little astonish'd to see in my hands a thing which is so common in Europe. I ask'd
them whether they had ever seen any such before. They told me, they had not, but said, that there
was heretofore in Persia, a very fair Globe, which they call Felek, but that it was lost during
the Warrs between them and the Turks. They haply meant that which Sapor, King of Persia,
had caus'd to be made of Glass, so large, that he could sit in the Centre of it, and observe the
motions of the Stars, and must no doubt be like that of Archimedes, whereof Claudian speaks
in the Epigram, which begins thus,
Iupiter in parvo cum cernerct aethera vitro.
               
               Antiquity might haply admire these works; but what miracle would it be thought, if they
saw the Globe which his Highness the Duke of Holstein hath ordered to be made in his City of
Gottorp. It is a double Globe, made of Copper, ten foot and a half Diameter, so that within
it, ten persons may sit at a Table, which, with the seats about it, hangs at one of its poles.
There a man may see, by means of an Horizontal Circle within the Globe, how the Stars and
the Sun it self, coming out of its Centre, moves of it self through its Ecliptick degrees, and
rises and sets regularly. The motion of this Globe exactly follows that of the Heavens, and
derives that motion from certain Wheels, driven by the water, which is brought out of a
Mountain hard by, and let in, as it requires more or less, according to the swiftness of the
Sphears.
               The Persians regulate their year according to the Moon,The Lunar and Solar year in Persia. as well as the Sun, so as that they
have both Solar and Lunar years; to wit, the latter, for their Festivals, and Religious Ceremonies,
which are appointed on certain dayes of the Moneth, and these Moneths beginning and
ending with the Moon, make their year shorter than ours by twelve dayes. Their Solar year
is of 365. dayes, and was so accounted even in the time of Alexander the Great, as Q. Curtius
expressly observes in the 7. Chap. of the 3. Book of his History, where he sayes, speaking of
Darius's Retinue, that, after the Magi, follow'd three hundred sixty five young Men, compleating
the number of the dayes of their year, which consisted of so many dayes, that is to say,
twelve Moneths of thirty dayes a piece, and five dayes over and above. It begins, at that very
minute that the Sun, entring into Aries, makes the Equinox, and brings in the first day of the
Spring. That day they call Naurus, or Neurus, that is, the new day. They count the years
of their age, according to the course of the Sun, so that to express how old they are, they say,
they have liv'd so many Narus's, that is, so many years. It is one of the principal functions of
the Minatzim, to observe, by the Astrolabe, the happy minute, in which the Sun comes to

the Aequator, and as soon as he declares it is, they all begin to rejoyce. Their Epoche is
the Hegira, or flight of Mahomet, which falls on the 10. of Iuly, in the 622. year of our
Saviour.
               The Persians had heretofore their Almanack, or Takhuim, which was particular to them,
and every day of the Moneth had its name from some of their Kings or Heroes, as Oromasda,
Behemer, Adarpahascht, Scharias, &c. as we find it in Scaliger, in his incomparable Treatise,
de Emendatione Temporum, and in the Ephemerides of Origanus: but they are not used now,
no more than the Epoche of Iesdetzird, or as Scaliger calls him, Iesdegird, who was the Son
of Schaherjar, and Grand Son of Chosroes, who was kill'd by Otman, the Son of Ophan, a Sarasin,
on the 16. of Iune in the 632. They had no other till the year 1079. at which time
Albu Arsalan, King of Chorasan, Mesopotamia and Persia, a Sarasin, having brought together
eight Astronomers, very Learned Men, reform'd the year of Iesdegird, and constituted another
Epoche, which they began on the 14. day of the year, and which is called Tzelalee, or Sulthance,
or, in the Arabian, Tarich, altzelalit, that is, the Era, or Epoche, of Augustus, from
the word Tzelaf, which signifies Majesty, or Highness. Now, they have the Arabian Kalender,
and the names of their twelve Moneths are, Mharem, Sefar, Rebbi Ewel, Rebbi Achir,
Tzemadi Ewel, Tzemadi Achir, Retzeb, Scabahn, Schawal, Dsilkade, and Dsilhatse. It is
also to be observ'd, that the Persians have a way of accompting by four years, much after the
same manner as the Greeks accompted by their Olympiads, and the Romans, by Lustra, which
consisted of five years, and then they give the first year of their accompt, the name of the first
Moneth of the year, to the four ensuing years, that of the second Moneth, and so of the rest;
so that to know that they speak of a Moneth, and not of years, they add, to the names of the
Moneths, the word Mah, which signifies a Moneth. Abraham Ecchelensis gives the Etymology
of it, as he does also that of the dayes of the week, in his History of Arabia, pag. 204. &c.
They begin the week with Saturday, that the seventh day, which is the day of rest, may fall
upon Friday, which to them is as the Sunday is to Christians, and Saturday to the Iews. The
names of the seven dayes of the week are these, to wit, Saturday, Scembe, Sunday, Iekschembe,
Monday, Duschembe, Tuesday, Seschembe, Wednesday, Tschaschembe, Thursday, Denschembe,
and Friday, Adine, or Tzumeh, that is, the day of Assembly, in regard that on that day,
they meet at their Assemblies to do their Devotions. They account Tscharchembe the most unfortunate
day of all the Week.
               They are extremely addicted to Astrology, and in imitation of the Chaldaeans, of whom,
doubtless, they learnt that Science, they are so superstitious, that they do not only credit all
the Astrologers tell them, but also, persons of quality do no business of any consequence, undertake
no journey, nay would be loath to put on a new Garment, get on Horse-back to Ride
abroad, or Bath themselves, but they first consult the Minatzim, who is so much the more credited
by them, in that many times they heighten the Vanity of their Art by a Profession, no
less deceitful than the other, which is Medicine. This perswasion of theirs is grounded on the
opinion they have, as well as the Arabians, that the Stars are governed by Intelligences, who
have an absolute power over sublunary things; so that it is no hard matter to make them acquiesce
in the prediction of the Astrologers. These are either Mountebanks, or Magicians,
who, by their equivocal expressions circumvent those who consult them, purposely to disturb
their Brains, and to put tricks upon them, as Stephen Alexander did upon Heraclius, when he
fore-told him, that he should perish in the water, obliging him thereby to fill up all the Lakes
and Ponds all over the Empire. After the same manner was also deceived Iohn Menard, a
Physician of Ferrara, who was told he should perish in a Ditch. He avoided them all, but that
of a young Woman, whom he Married in his old age, and who visibly shorned his dayes.
They attribute to every hour in the day one of the Signs of the Zodiack, to wit, to the first,
Aries, to the second, Taurus, and so forward; and they believe there are in every Moneth,
some unfortunate dayes, especially the 3. the 5. and the 23. and 25. of every Moon. Abraham
Ecchelensis, whom we cited before, relates, to this purpose, two remarkable stories, taken
out of the 9. Book of the Chronicles of Gregorius Barhebra, where he sayes, that in the 198.
year of the Hegira, there liv'd a Man, who, among other things, had a Ring, which made
him that had it on his Finger laugh as long as it was on. He himself was the onely man who
could use it as another Ring; and he had also a Pen, wherewith no body could Write, and
which no body was able to guide with his hand, but he himself. Whence it came, that the Calif,
Alamun, who liv'd in that time, would needs have his Nativity calculated by the famous
Astrologer Albumazar, who found that his Ascendent was in Taurus, between whom and Iupiter,
cauda draconis and Venus, there was a benevolent aspect, and that the Sun and Moon
were in the same degree of the Ascendent. The other Story is of a Physician, named Tabet Harensis,
who feeling a man's Pulse, told him he had eaten Veal, and taken of a Broath, whereof
the Milk was turn'd in the boyling, yet had not any reason to give for what he said, save that
the Physician knew it by some particular instinct, and that he had receiv'd that gift from secret
influence.
               
                  
Yet for all this prejudice they have for the influences of the Stars, they attribute much to
Chance, and endeavour to discover the secrets of things by those means, especially such as are
not yet come to pass, the knowledge whereof is not so easie.
               Tis true, they are for the most part Women, who address themselves to these people, who
have their Shops or Stalls in the Maidan, near the Dowlet Chane, and fore-tell things by Lot,
two manner of wayes. Some of them, whom they call Remal, have seven or eight Dice strung
together upon two little pieces of Wire, and they predict according to the falling of the Dice.
The others, whom they call Falkir, do their work with much more Ceremony. For they have
before them, upon a Table, thirty or forty little pieces of board, about an inch square, very
thinn and very smooth, which are mark'd with certain Characters on that side which lies downwards.
Upon one of these little pieces of board, he who desires to know what is to befall him,
is to lay down his Money, which the Falkir immediately puts up, and no doubt this is that
which is most certain in the whole Mystery. That done, he turns over a Book that lies before
him, about three fingers thick, the leaves whereof are Painted with all sorts of Figures, as
Angels, Devils, Satyrs, Dragons and other Monsters, and he opens the Book several times, till
he finds one that hath some rapport to the Characters upon the little board. Neither is that done
without Muttering between his teeth certain inarticulate and not intelligible words; and this is
the most infallible prediction they have among them.
               The political Government of Persia,The political Government of Persia. differs not much from that of the Muscovites. Both are
Monarchical, and so Despotick, that the Prince governs with an absolute power, making his
Will a Law, and, without any accompt to be given of his so doing, disposing of the Lives and
Estates of his Subjects; who are so far his Slaves, that they do not so much as murmur at the
Violence, wherewith the greatest Lords of the Kingdom are put to Death, without any kind of
proceedings against them.
               They call their Kings Schach, Paschach, and Padischach, words which have in a manner all
the same signification, to wit, that of King, or Lord. Yet does not the Emperour of the
Turks, when he writes to the King of Persia, give him the quality of Schach, but that of Schich
Ogli, that is to say, Ecclesiastick, or Son, or Kinsman, of the Prophet. Those who say,
the Kings of Persia assume the quality of Choda, that is God, are mistaken. For Chodabende is
the proper name of a man, as Theodosius, Theodore, &c. and signifies, oblig'd to God, or a
Servant of God; though it must be confess'd, that these Princes are Vain-Glorious enough to
assume extravagant Titles which make them equal to the Sun and Moon, and Companions of
the Stars; Ammianus Marcellinus saies of Sapor, King of Persia. Tis true on the other
side, that they are as free to give the same Titles to those Princes of Europe with whom they
live in good correspondence: for in the Letters which Schach Sefi writ to the Duke of Holstein,
he gave him the same qualities he assum'd himself. They would not have inscriptions of Letters
fill'd with the Titles of the Kingdoms and Provinces under their Jurisdiction: nay Schach-Abas
would have no other title at the head of a Petition than that of Schach, and one day said to a
man that had set several titles at the head of his Petition, Go thy wayes, friend, thy titles
will make me neither more powerfull nor more poor; Give me that of Schach, since I am so,
and think that enough.
               Most Authors give the Kings of Persia of the last Race the quality of Sophi;The quality of Sophi. and the Kings
themselves, especially those who have any zeal for their Religion, are much pleas'd with the
addition of that quality to their titles, out of the affection they bear Schich Sofi, or Sefi, the
first Institutor of their Sect; as the Kings of France take the quality of most Christian; those of
Spain, that of most Catholick, and those of England, that of Defenders of the Faith. Whence
they say, Ismael-Sofi, Eider-Sofi: and of this a man must taxe notice in the reading of their
History, inasmuch as if he do not, he may confound the Names of the Kings, and attribute that
to one which is to be understood of another.
               The Kingdom of Persia is Hereditary,The Kingdom of Persia Hereditary. and may be enjoy'd, not only by the Children lawfully
begotten, but also, for want of such, by natural Children, and the Sons of Concubines, who
inherit the Crown as well as the others, nay they are preferr'd before the nearest of the Collateral
Kinred, and the Nephews; since the Sons of Concubines and Slaves are not accounted
illegitimate in Persia, as we have said elsewhere. For want of Sons, the Crown falls to the
next of Kin by the Father's side, descended from Sefi, who are as it were Princes of the Blood-Royal,
and are called Schich Eluend. They enjoy many great Privileges and Immunities, but
many times, they are very poor, and have much ado to live. The Children of the Kings of Persia
make the Houses where they are Born, Free, and they are converted into Sanctuaries; insomuch
that if the Queen be delivered in any other place besides the Metropolis, the House is compass'd
with a noble VVall, to be distinguish'd from others.
               If we may credit Q. Curtius,The arms of Persia. the antient Arms of Persia were the Crescent, as the Sun was
that of the Greeks. Now, the Turks take the Crescent, and the Persians, the Sun, which they
commonly put upon the back of a Lion. But upon the great Seal of the Kingdom there are only
Characters, It is about the bigness of a half Crown piece, having within the Ring; To God

alone, I Schich Sefi am a Slave with all my Heart: and in the Circumference; Aly, let the
World say what it please of Thee, yet will I be thy Friend. He who before thy Gate does not account
himself dust and ashes, though he were an Angel, dust and ashes be upon his Head. In the Letters he
sends to Christian Princes, he observes this respect, that he does not set the Seal on the same
side with the Writing, but on the other side, at the very bottom.
               The Ceremonies performed at the Coronation of the Kings of Persia,The Coronation of their Kings. are not done at Babylon,
as some Authors would have it believ'd, nor yet at Kufa, as Minadous affirms,
but in the City of Ispahan. They are not so great as those done at the Inauguration of
Kings in Europe. They set upon a Table, about half an Ell high, as many pieces of Tapistry
of Gold an Silver, or Embroider'd as there have been Kings of the same Family, before him
who is then to be Crowned; so that at the Coronation of Schach Sefi, there were eight;
inasmuch as he was the eighth King of Persia of that House, accompting from Ismael the first.
That done, the chiefest of the Chans present him with a Crown, which he kisses thrice, in
the Name of God, of Mahomet, and of Aaly, and having put it to his Fore-head, he delivers
it to the Grand Master of the Kingdom, whom they call Lele, who puts it on his Head; and
then all present make Acclamations, of Long live the King; God grant, that, during his
Reign, one year may be multiply'd to a thousand; they kiss his Feet, make him great Presents,
and spend the remainder of the day in Feasting and Merriment. There is no such thing among
them as the taking of any Oath of Allegiance, or obliging the King to swear to the Conservation
of the Privileges, or Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, in regard their subjection is
pure Slavery; whereas among Christians, the condition of Kings is quite otherwise, for the
obligation is reciprocal, and the Kings are not absolute Lords, but are, or ought to be, Fathers
of their people.
               The Kingdom is of great extent. Those Provinces which lie most remote from the chief
Citie, and the ordinary residence of the Kings, cannot be governed otherwise than by Governours
or Lieutenants, who, in Persia, are called Chans; the word not signifying the imployment
they have in the said Governments, but a quality which all great Lords assume to themselves.
Of this we shall speak more at large elsewhere, and here give a short accompt of the Kings of
Persia who have reign'd within these hundred years; with some assurance, that the Reader will
think this digression the less tedious, when he finds me positively affirming, that there is hardly
any Author who hath written the History of them. We said before that the Emperour of the
Turks, when he writes to the King of Persia, give him not the quality of Schach, but of
Schich-Ogli, in as much as he is not descended from the antient Family of the Kings of Persia,
but from a later,Ismael
                   as we shall now make it appear.
               Hassan Padschach, who was sirnamed Vssum Cassan, that is to say Grand Signor, by reason
of the great Wars he managed, and where in he was alwayes victorious, was of the Family
of the Asimbels, and liv'd about the end of the fifteenth age. He was Governour of Armenia
Major, and having gain'd several victories over the Turks, he reduc'd several Poovinces by
force of Arms, and among others, Persia, whereof he made himself King. Vssum Cassan
had three sons, Vnger Mahomed, Calul, and Iacup. The first was strangled by the Father's
order,Iacup. against whom he had taken up Arms; and the second was poyson'd by the third; so
that Vssum Cassan dying, on the fifth of Ianuary 1485. Iacup succeeded him: but he enjoy'd
not long the Kingdom he had got with the price of his Brother's bloud; for his own Wife poysoned
him within a short time after his coming to the Crown. After his death, Schich Eider,
son-in-law to Vsum Cassan, sirnamed Harduellis, from the place of his birth, pretended to
the succession; but it was disputed against him, first by Iulaver, a Persian Lord, and afterwards
by Baylinger, and Rustan.
               The Turks, who slighted Schich Eider, by reason of the meanness of his birth, (notwithstanding
which Vssum Cassan had bestow'd on him his Daughter Martha, whom he had had
by Despina, the Daughter of Calojean, King of Trebisond) and hated him, particularly upon
this accompt, that he had quitted their Religion, presuming that a man, who pretended
much to Devotion and Sanctity, would be unexpert, if not unfortunate in the business of
Arms, declar'd a war against him, entred Persia with a powerfull Army, gave him battel, and
defeated him, in so much that falling alive into their hands, they flead his head and pull'd down
his skin over his ears. 'Tis true, there is so great discrepancy among the Persian Authors,
concerning this story, that we have been forc'd herein to follow the common opinion; though
there are some who affirm, that Eider was not King, but that Rustan, King of Persia fearing
he might come to be King, treated him as we said before. Nay, some affirm, that this happened
in the time of Iacup, the son of Vssum Cassan. But what cannot well be deny'd of the story,
is, that, about that time, the Turks became Masters of most of the Provinces of Persia; and
that Rustan was succeeded by Agmar,Ismae
                   Carabem, and Aluantes.
               Schich Eider, who first chang'd the quality of Schich, that is, Prophet, into that of
Schach, or King, left one son named Ismael: but he was so young, when his Father
died, that all could be done for him, was to secure his person at the house of a certain

Lord of the Province of Kilan, a Kinsman and Friend of his Father's, named Pyr Chalim,
who brought him up, and instructed him in the same Sect his Father had been of. Ismael
being come to years of discretion, discover'd himself to be a person of an excellent understanding
and great courage, and there were the greater hopes conceiv'd of him, out of this
respect, that his Father, who was well skill'd in Astrology, had Predicted that his son should
do wonders, as being the person designed for the restauration of Persia, by the reduction of
many Provinces, and the propagation he should make of his new Religion. Accordingly, he
made such advantage of the opportunity he then had, while the Emperour of the Turks was at
Constantinople, little thinking what might happen towards Persia, that having, by the advice
of Pyr, sent Deputies into the neighbouring Provinces and Cities, he so far satisfy'd them of
the right he had to the Crown, and prevail'd with them to reflect on the interest of the State,
and the preservation of Religion, that having got together an Army of twenty thousand men,
with which he left Latretzan, in the Province of Kilan, the Inhabitants of the other Provinces
came in so fast, that it was, of a sudden swell'd to three hundred thousand. With this Army,
he marched streight to Ardebil, whence he forc'd away all the Turks, some few onely excepted,
who were got into a street behind Schich Sefi's Sepulchre, where they Petition'd for
their lives, and promised to Embrace the Persian Religion: and thence it comes, that the said
street is, to this day, called Vrume Mahele. It was upon this exploit that many Persians
came to be sirnamed Kisilbaschs, as we have shewn before.
               Ardebil being thus reduc'd, Ismael went to Tabris Scamachie, and Iruan, and recover'd all
the Cities and Provinces which the Truks had taken from his Father, and had been possess'd of
ever since his death. He afterwards entred into Turkey, gave the Emperour battel, and defeated
him. The particulars of that War may be seen in the Letter which Henry Penia, who
was then in Persia, writ to Cardinal Sauli; and they agree with what the Persians themselves
write thereof. After this Victory he took Bagdat, Besre, Kurdestan, Diarbek, Wan, Esserum,
Ersingan. Bitlis, Adiltschouas, Alchat, Berdigk, Kars, Entakie. As soon as he had secur'd
the Frontiers against the attempts of the Turks, he turn'd his Armies Eastward, and took,
from the King of the Indies, the Province of Candahar, and the next adjoyning Province, the
same good success, which he had had against the Turks, still attending him. 'Twas after this
last Conquest that he went to Caswin, to be Crown'd. He stay'd there but just the time requisite
for that Ceremony, and to refresh his Forces, with which he afterwards went into Georgia,
Defeated the King of that Countrey, whom the Histories call Simon Padschach, and
forc'd him to pay him, yearly, three hundred Bails of Silk, by way of Tribute. The
difficulties which Schach Ismael Sofi met with in all these Wars, were not so small but the
Persians grew weary of them, though the zeal of their Religion induc'd them to suffer the
utmost extremities; even death it self, with resolution enough. But the consequence of these
Victories, and the good success which Ismael had in all his designs, was, that they raised him to
so high an esteem, that all the other Princes of Asia, nay, several Monarchs of Europe
courted his friendship, by solemn Embassies, which gave our Writers the first acquaintance
they had with the affairs of Persia. And whereas he made a strict Profession of the Persian
Religion, and had a great Devotion for Aly, so far as to assume the quality of Sofi, thence it
comes, that our Historians speak of him as the principal Propagator, nay, indeed, as the first
Institutor of that Sect. He died at Caswin, in the forty fifth year of his age, and was buried
at Ardebil. He had the reputation of being a great observer of Justice, but it is affirm'd of
him, that he made no great difficulty to drink Wine, and eat Swines flesh; nay, that, in
derision of the Turkish Religion, he had a Hog kept in his Court, which he named Bajazeth.
               Schach Ismael Sofi left four Sons, whereof the eldest, named Tamas, succeeded his Father
in the Kingdom of Persia,Schach Tamas. but not in the vertues and great endowments, which had made him
considerable all over the World. The three others, to wit, Helcasi, Beiram, and Sor-Myrza,
had certain Territories assign'd them. This change was perceiv'd at the very beginning of his
Government. For Sulthan Solyman, Emperour of the Turks, taking notice of the weakness
of Schach Tamas in matter of Government, raised a powerfull Army, enters the Kingdom of
Persia, under the Conduct of Sulthan Murat Bascha, and recover'd from the Persiaus all
that Schach Ismael had taken from the Turks, Bagdan and Wan onely excepted. Two years after
Solyman came in person into Persia, where he took Tauris, and besieg'd Sulthania, Schach
Tamas, who was in the mean time at Caswin, having not so much courage as to raise the Siege.
But as good fortune would have it, it happened, that during the time of the Siege, in the
moneth of March, some few dayes before their Naurus, there fell so great a Rain, accompany'd
by such a violent Tempest, that the Snow of the adjacent Mountains dissolving, and
the water over-flowing all the Valleys, Soliman who was incommodated thereby; and fround
the water of a reddish colour, contracted haply from the ground, through which it had pass'd,
was frightned thereat, raised the Siege, and departed the Kingdom. In his retreat, he destroy'd
all before him, but was engag'd neer Bitlis, where he was absolutely defeated. Schach
Tamas dying the 11. of May 1576. in the 68th. year of his age, and the 42th. of his

reign, left a very ill repute of himself among the Persians, who speak of him with some prejudice,
as well in relation to his Conduct, as his Courage. They change him, among other
things, that he was very careless of doing Justice to his Subjects, and had committed the administration
of the affairs of his kingdom to his Ministers, as they are ordinarily wont to do, who
cannot love a people that hath no affection for them. They blame him for protecting Hamajum,
the Son of Selim, king of the Indies, to whom he gave Refuge and Protection, against
the Persecutions of Tzelaleden Ekbet, his Uncle, a younger Brother of Selim's, who had usurp'd
the Crown, and demanded him of Schach-Tamas, that he might be put to death. But that was
a generous and just action, and is not to be produc'd among the examples that are alleged of his
violence and injustice, especially with any parallel to the ensuing story.
               Lavassap, Prince of Armenia, had two Sons, Simon and David, and left the former, as being
the Elder, the Government of the Country. David, who had too much courage to be satified
with a small Territory, found means to raise an Army, such as might frighten his Elder
Brother, who, being really afraid of an insurrection, desir'd the assistance of Schach Tamas,
who sent him four thousand Horse, ordering him who had the Conduct of them, if possible, to
take David alive, and send him to him, nay, to Crown him, in case he should comply so far
as to be Circumcised, but with this Proviso, that he should prefer Simon, if he would take the
Crown upon the same terms. David being taken in the first Engagement, soon hearkened to
the King of Persia's Proposition, and promis'd to change his Religion, and do homage for his
Province, if the King would establish him in his Brother place. Simon express'd a greater constancy,
and would not change his Religion; whereupon he was imprison'd, in the Fortress of
Kahak; and David, who after his Circumcision was called Dant-Chan, was forc'd to content
himself with the Government of Tiflis. Simon remain'd some time a prisoner; but the Reputation
he had of being a good Soldier, and a knowing person, brought him, first, acquainted, and
afterwards very intimate with Schach Ismael the second, the Son of Schach Tamas, who promis'd
to deliver him out of the Captivity, which he was to expect should have lasted as long as
he liv'd, and to restore him to his Territories, if he would change his Religion. He did so, at
left in outward thew, but Ismael dying soon after, he was little the better for his Promises.
He was indeed set at liberty some time after his death; but Chodabende, coming to the Crown,
minded not much the performance of his Brother's promises, and forc'd Simon to content himself
with the employment he bestow'd on him in the Wars he was then engag'd in against the
Turks.
               Schach Tamas had by several Wives eleven Sons, and three Daughters, and among the rest,
Mahomet, on whom upon his having shaken hands with all business, by reason of the weakness
of his sight, and embracing a devout kind of life, they bestow'd the Sirname of Chodabende, that
is (servant of God) Ismael, and Eider. Tamas had a particular kindness for Eider, his third
Son, and it was his design to prefer him before the two Elder in the Government of the Kingdom,
and to make the more sure work, he permitted him, even in his life time, to assume some
part thereof. But after his death, the Lords of the Countrey sent to Mahomet, to desire him to
accept of the Crown, which was his right by birth; and upon his refusal, they sent to Ismael,
who was, by his Father's order a Prisoner in the Castle of Cahak, for having, upon his own accompt,
made incursions into the Turks Dominions, though, in his Soul, he had an aversion for
the Persian Religion, and in effect made profession of the Turkish. Eider, who was but seventeen
years of age, was so impatient to get into the Throne, that he had the insolence to put the
Crown on his head, and present himself, in that posture, before his Father, who was then near
his death; and desirous to make his advantage of Ismael's absence, and Mahomet's refusal,
made use of the interest which Periaconcona, his Sister, had with the Grandees, to mount the
Throne. The Princess, who had declar'd for the interest of the elder Brethren, considering
with her self, that in their absence, Eider might commit such violences as might prevent her securing
of the Crown for Ismael, thought it not safe openly to oppose the pretensions of the
younger Brother, but suffer'd him to assume the title of King, and he was acknowledg'd as such
all over the Palace. But she had all the Avenues so well Guarded, that it was impossible for
Eider's friends to carry any tidings of it to the City. So that the young Prince coming to distrust
his Sister's carriage, and apprehending it might be their design to sacrifice him to his Brother's
ambition, conceal'd himself among the Women, till such time as Schamal, a Georgian, his Uncle
by the Mother-side, found him out, and cut off his head.
               Ismael 11. coming to the Crown, in the 43. year of his age, and reflecting on his long imprisonment,
confirm'd, by his procedure, the antient Proverb, which sayes, that the reign of
a Prince who returns from Exile, is ever cruel and bloudy. This man began his, with the executions
of all the Kinred and Frinds of Eider, and all those who had advis'd his Father to imprison
him, pursuing those whom he could not get apprehended, even as far as the Frontiers of
Turkey, and at his first entrance, discover'd the inclination he had to the Turkish Religion, which
he openly profess'd. To find out how the Grandees of the Kingdom were affected towards him,
a report was spread abroad of his death, but he rose up again too soon for those, who had been

so imprudent as to discover their aversion to his Government. For he brought to execution all
such as he conceiv'd any jealousie of, and exercis'd so great cruelty, that, his own Sister thinking
not her self secure, thought it her best course to prevent her own destruction by attempting
the King's. Certain it is, he dy'd a violent death, on the 24. of November 1577. and that Periaconcona
was the Contriver and Instrument of it: but this was done so secretly, that it is yet
not known, how Persia came to be rid of this Tyrant.
               Ismael II. being thus remov'd out of the way,Mahomet Chodabende, they made a shift so far to satisfie Mahomet
Chodabende, his elder Brother, of the danger, whereto he expos'd his Person and the Country,
if he suffered the Crown to come to a strange Family, that, at last, he resolv'd to accept of it,
but upon condition, that, before he were oblig'd to make his entrance into Caswin, they should
bring him the head of Periaconcona, who had imbru'd her hands in the bloud of two of his Brethren,
and in whose power it was in some respects to dispose of the Kingdom. She prostituted
her self to several of the Grandees about the Court, but particularly to Emeer Chan, whom she
had raised into some hopes of enjoying the Crown. As soon as Chodabende came to the Government,
which was in the year 578. he seem'd not to mind any thing so much as to imitate those
among his Predecessors, who had contributed most to the preservation and glory of the Kingdom
of Persia. This is the Testimony given of him by F. Bizarrus; but the Persian Authors
affirm, on the contrary, that never any Prince manag'd a Scepter with greater negligence and
pusillanimity, in so much that finding himself not fit for the carrying on of any Military design,
he spent all his time within the Palace, in Gaming, and diverting himself with the Ladies. That
he was unfortunate to his Wars, and that the common Enemy tasing advantage of his poorness
of spirit and effeminacy, made incursions into Persia, to wit, the Turks on one side, and the
Vsbeques Tartars, on the other: That both these Nations possess'd themselves of several Provinces
belonging to that Crown, and were not dispossess'd of them, as long as Mahomet Chodabende
liv'd. Minadous observes, among other passages, that the Turks kill'd, in one battel,
five thousand Persians, and took three thousand prisoners, whom the Turkish General ordered
to have their heads cut off, and having heap'd them up together, he sate down upon
the heap, and gave audience to a young Prince of Georgia who was come to give him a
Visit.
               Mahomed Chodabende dy'd in the year 1585.Emir Hemse. leaving three Sons, Emir Hemse, Ismael, and
Abas. The former, as being the eldest of the three Brethren, was Crowned King of Persia;
but Ismael, troubled to see the Crown on his Brother's head, manag'd his affairs so well, and
insinuated himself so much into the affections of the chiefest Lords of the Kingdom, that they
conspir'd the death of Emir Hemse.Ismael III Ismael got him kill'd, in the eighth moneth of his reign,
by a sort of people disguiz'd in VVomens Cloaths, who being cover'd with Veils, according to
the custom of the Countrey, came to the Schach's Chamber door, and told the Guards, that
they were the VVives of some of the Chans, whom the King had sent for, and that they waited
there in obedience to his commands. The Murtherers were no sooner got into the Chamber,
but they fell upon the King and kill'd him. But this death was soon after reveng'd upon the Contriver
of it, as we shall relate.
               Abas Myrza, that is to say, Prince Abas, Mahomet Chodabende's third Son, was Governour
of Herat, and was come thence, with an intention to see Emir Hemse, his Brother; but
hearing, in his way, of the Murther committed upon him, and having some reason to fear,
that the Murtherer might be advis'd, to secure himself in the Throne, by a double fratricide,
return'd back into his Government. The year following Abas Myrsa being advanc'd as far as
Caswin, while the King was at Kabach, there happened such frequent differences between the
people belonging to the two Brothers, that they heightned the reciprocal distrust they had one
of another. Abas Myrsa had about him a Lord of great quality, named Murschidculi-Chan,
who had acquir'd so great reputation by his prudence and courage, that Chodabende had
entrusted him with the conduct and education of that young Prince. This Murschidculi, knowing
that Ismael, who had express'd but too much animosity against his Brother, would never
pardon him, and that his life absolutely depended on that of his Master; and considering withall,
that if he prov'd the occasion of raising that Prince, whom he had Govern'd from his youth, to
the Throne, he would have a great share in the Government, resolv'd to prevent the King,
who was already come into the Province of Karabach, purposely to march in person against his
Brother. To effect this, some of the great Lords of the Court, who hoped to get into favour
with Abas Myrsa, corrupted one of Ismael's Barbers, named Chudi, who, coming to trim
him,Ismael III kill'd. cut his Throat. The Lords, who were present at the execution, and thought it concern'd
them to justifie themselves, kill'd the Barber, cut his body into little bits, and reduc'd it to
ashes. Thus dy'd Schach Ismael III. in the eighth moneth of his reign.
               Abas Myrsa had already so for gain'd the affections of the Persians,Schach-Abas succeeds. by his vivacity of
spirit, and the moderation they had observ'd through the whole course of his life, that he ascended
the Throne with the general satisfaction of all the people. But the favour of Murschidculi-Chan,
who had most contributed to his advancement, continu'd not long: for assuming to himself

the same authority over the King, which he had had before, while he was onely Myrsa
or Prince, he became troublesome and insupportable, and that in so high a degree, that, one
day, the King, desirous to give his opinion upon an affair of great importance, which had been
propos'd, Murschidculi-Chan had the insolence to tell him, before a full Council, that he
was not fit to speak of affairs of that nature, they being such as were above the reach of his age
and understanding. The King dissembled, for the present, his Resentment thereof, but considering,
that that Authority of Murschidculi-Chan would eclipse his own, and expose him to
the contempt of his Subjects, he resolv'd to rid his Governour out of the way. He complain'd
of his Favorite's insolence to three Lords of his Council, named Mehediculi-Chan, Mahomed
Vstadscahi, and Aliculi-Chan, of whom he thought he might be most confident; but finding
they demurr'd upon the business, and, being not too well assur'd what resolution the King
would take, in a business, which to them was of the greatest consequence of any in the World,
that they endeavour'd to disswade him from it, he told them, it was his will, that Murschidculi-Chan
should die by their hands, and that if they made any scruple to do it, he should find
means to be obey'd, as, on the contrary, he should not be backward in requiting their services,
who upon that occasion should implicitly execute his commands. This, extremity forc'd them to
follow the King into his Favourite's Chamber, into which he got ere Murschidculi-Chan
was awake; so that the King, having found him lying on his back, with his mouth open, gave
him the first blow over-thwart the mouth. The rest gave him each of them a stab; but Murschidculi-Chan,
being a very stout man, had the courage to get off his bed, and put himself into
such a posture, as should have given them more fear, than he had receiv'd hurt from them,
and no doubt he had dispatch'd some of his murtherers, had it not been for one of his Grooms,
who coming in at the noise, with a batle-axe in his hand, the King said to him; I would have
the life of Murschidculi-Chan, who is become my Enemy; Go, dispatch him, and I will make thee
a Chan. The Groom did his work as the king commanded, went streight to his Master and
dispatch'd him.
               The next day, the king put to death all the relations and friends of Murschidculi-Chan, that
so he might be absolutely eas'd of all the disturbances, which their discontents might have given
him; and conferr'd on the Groom the Dignity of Chan, with the Government of Herat.
This Execution happened in the year 1585. which was the first of the reign of Schach Abas.
               The first actions of Schach-Abas made a sufficient discovery of his abililities in order to Government,
and that there was no necessity of his being any longer under the Eye and Conduct of
another. All his thoughts were bent upon recovering the great Provinces, which the Turks and
Tartars had usurp'd from the Crown of Persia, and he made an absolute resolution to declare a
War against both those Nations, upon that score. Being one day at Caswin, he took a walk
out of the Citie, and ask'd the Lords who follow'd him, whether there could be a nobler Countrey
than that where they then were. There were some took the freedom to tell him, that it
was iudeed an excellent good Countrey, yet was it not to be compar'd with the Province of
Fars, much less with that of Chorasan, especially that part of the said Province, which the
Vsbeques had taken from Persia,Engages in a War against the Tartars. in the time of his Father's reign. Upon this discourse, he immediately
resolv'd upon a War against the Tartars, and having rais'd a powerfull Army, he
entred Chorasan. Abdulla, Prince of the Vsbeques, met him, and, at first, with some advantage
over him, in regard the Plague, which was got into Schach Abas's Army, and the unseasonable
weather kept it from being in action. The two Armies were neer six moneths in sight one
of the other; but at last Schach Abas set upon Abdulla, and forc'd him to retreat to Mesched.
Schach Abas continu'd three years in Chorasan, Abdulla being not in a condition to disturb him
in his new Conquest, and when he attempted it, he was so unfortunate, that his Army was
not onely defeated, but also he himself, with Tilem-Chan, his Brother, and his three Sons,
who were in the Army, fell into the hands of Schach-Abas, who order'd them all to have their
heads cut off. Afterwards Schach-Abas went to Ispahan, and found it so excellently well situated,
and the Countrey about it so pleasant, that he resolv'd to make it the Metropolis of the Kingdom,
beautifying it, to that end, with many Magnificent Structures, and among others, the
Allacapi, or Sanctuary, and the Sumptuous Mosquey Mehedi, of which we have given an
accompt already. In which Magnificence the Lords of the Court were desirous to imitate him,
by building many rich and noble Palaces.
               After these victories,And against the Turks. he march'd against the Turks, and having understood by his Spies, that
the Garrison of Tabris thought of nothing less than a War, he got together, with as little
noise as might be, a little Army, with which he went in less than six dayes from Ispahan to
Tabris, though it be ordinarily eighteen dayes journey for the Camels. Being come to the passage
of Scibli, within four leagues of Tabris, where the Turks kept a party, rather to receive
the customs upon Commodities, than to hinder the entrance of the Persians, he, with some
Officers left the Army, and advanc'd as far as the Turn-Pike. The Turks imagining they were
Merchants, the Secretary of the Custom-house address'd himself to Schach-Abas, and ask'd
him for the duties. Schach-Abas told him, that he who carried the Purse was coming behind,

and, having caus'd Dsulfakar-Chan to come up to him, he bid him give the other some money;
but while the Secretary was telling it, he order'd one to dispatch him, made the Soldiers who
kept the Post to submit, and pass'd over his Army. Aly Bascha, Governour of Tabris, having
intelligence hereof, got some Troops together, at lest as many as the distraction of his affairs
would permit him to do, and went to meet Abas, but there being a great inequality between
the Forces on both sides, he was overcome, and fell into the hands of the Persians. In the midst
of the Citie, there was a Citadel, built by Hassan Padschach, otherwise called Vssum Cassan,
which the Turks kept a moneth after, but, at last, it was taken, by intelligence, and afterwards
demolish'd. Thence he went to Nachtzuan; but the Turkish Garrison quitted the place, upon
the first news they receiv'd of the Persian Army's coming towards it, and retreated to Iruan.
Schach-Abas ordered also the demolishing of the Citadel of Nachtzuan, called Kischikalaban,
and went and lay before Iruan, which he took after a siege of nine moneths. This Conquest
facilitated his reduction of all the other Cities and Neighbouring Provinces, all which were reduc'd,
save onely the Fortress of Orumi, the strong and advantageous situation whereof, being
on the point of a Rock, putting him out of all hope of taking it by storm. He besieg'd it eight
moneths together, but finding that the Kurdes did him more mischief than the Turks themselves,
though they were a free people, and had no dependence on the Grand Seignor, he gain'd the
affections of the chiefest among them by Presents and Promises, putting them in hope of all advantages
on his side, if they would help him to take in that place, and promis'd them all the
booty they should find there. The Kurdes, who live onely by Rapine, were willing to serve
him upon those terms. But Schach-Abas having receiv'd that service from them, and taken the
Fort by their means, sent to invite the chiefest among them to come and Dine with him. He
had his Tent made with so many turnings and windings, and had those so done over with Cloaths,
that they who came in saw not such as were but six places before them. He had planted two
Executioners in the way, who dispatch'd his Guests as they came into the Tent; and this course
he took with them, out of an apprehension they might do the Turks the same services he had
receiv'd from them. He made Kahan Chan, Governour of Orumi and the neighbouring Province,
and marching still on, he became Master of all between the Rivers of Cyrus and Araxis,
and reduc'd into his power the Citie of Scamachie, after a siege of seven weeks, together with
the whole Province of Schirun, which he left under the Command of Dsulfakar-Chan his
Brother-in-law, The Inhabitants of Derbent, hearing what success Schach-Abas had had
against the Turks, kill'd their Turkish Garrison, and submitted to the King of Persia. Then
he entred the Province of Kilan, and reduc'd to obedience those people who fell off from the
King's of Persia, in the time of Schach-Tamas. He ordered to be made neer Lankeran, where
a great Fen in a manner cover'd that whole Province, and made the entrance into it very difficult,
a way or Bank of Sand, and setled Chans in several places of the Province; to wit, Baindurc-Chan,
at Astara, Mortusa Kuli-Chan, at Kesker, Heider-Chan, at Turkabun, a Visir,
at Rescht, Adam Sulthan, in Mesanderan, and Hosslein-Chan, at Astarabad.
               It was Schach-Abas his intention to sit still with these Conquests, but the quiet he had after
them was so little, that he had hardly the time to have his Soveraignty acknowledg'd. For,
being at Ispahan, about a year after this War, intelligence was brought him that the Turk was
coming into Persia, with an Army of five hundred thousand men; whereupon he got together
all the Forces he could, and appointed them their Rendezvous at Tabris, and ordered all the
Inhabitants of the Frontiers, to retire, with their Cattel, into Cities and Wall'd Towns, to
destroy all in the Fields, that the Enemy might make no advantage thereof in order to his subsistence.
The Turk having advanc'd, and encamp'd neer Tabris, the King of Persia caus'd it
to be publish'd through his Army, that such as were willing to serve as Volunteers, should list
themselves apart, and that for every Turks head they brought him, he would pay fifty Crowns.
About five thousand Persians listed themselves upon that accompt; so that not a day pass'd, but
some heads were brought in, and at his rising every morning, a good number was presented to
him. Nay, one Soldier, named Bairam Tekel brought him one morning five together, and by
that means gain'd the favour of Schach-Abas, who rais'd him to the Dignity of Chan.
               At the end of three moneths Tzakal Ogli, who commanded the Turkish Army, sent a kind
of Challenge to Schach-Abas, telling him, that if he had as much confidence in God and the
Justice of his cause, as he would have the VVorld believe, he should not be afraid of accepting
a general Engagement, which he thereby profer'd him. Abas was content, and having divided
the ground, the Sun and the VVind with his Enemy, gave him battel. It lasted all that day;
and the night following, the Turks, who had lost many of their men, retreated. The next
day word was brought to the Camp, that the Turks were retreated; but Abas, who fear'd
it might be a stratageme of theirs, stood on his Guard for three dayes, keeping the Army upon
continual duty, and not so much as going himself into his Tent during that time; till that the
Scouts having at last brought him word, that the Enemy was effectually retreated towards
the Frontiers, he advanc'd to the Mountain of Sehend, where he Encamped, and there it was,
that Mahumed Chan Kasak, Schaheruch-Chan, Esschar, and Iischan, Kurtzibaschi, were

cut to pieces, for having given the king poyson, who immediately taking an Antidore, receiv'd
no hurt thereby.
               Two years after this War, the Turk made another invasion into Persia, with an Army of
three hundred thousand men, and besieged the Fortress of Iruan, in the Province of the same
name: but he was forc'd to raise the siege and to retreat. About two years after that, Murat
Bascha, General of the Turkish Army, besieg'd and took Tabris, and kept it four moneths,
within which time there happen'd five set battels between those two Nations, with little advantage
to the Persians. And yet at last Schach-Abas defeated the Turks, and recover'd the Citie
out of their hands. Being after this expedition, return'd to Ardebil, he there caus'd to be
kill'd Dsulfakar, Chan of Scamachie in the manner we have related before, and put into his Government
Iusuf-Chan, an Armenian by birth, and by condition a Slave, who had a long time
serv'd him as on ordinary Foot-man.
               After this, Persia enjoy'd a Peace of twenty years together, at the end whereof the Turks
entred it again with a powerfull Army, under the Command of Chalil Basscha, with whom
joyned also several parties of the Tartars of Crim and Precop. Schach-Abas sent against them
Kartzschuckai-Chan, the most Valiant and most Fortunate of all his Captains, who wearied
them out, and forc'd them to retreat, after several Engagements, or Skirmishes rather, wherein
he took Prisoners two Tartar-Princes, Omersbeg, and Schahinkerai-Chan, and the Bashaws of
Egypt, Aleppo, Erserum, and Wan, The King, instead of treating them ill, presented each of
them with a Garment and an excellent Horse, and sent them back without paying any Ransom.
               Afterwards, Schach-Abas went into Georgia, where he staid nine moneths. During his aboad
there, Tameras-Chan, the Son of Simon had the confidence to enter with an Army into
the Province of Seggen, in the midst of Georgia, and to give battel to Schach-Abas; but he was
forc'd to retreat with great loss. While he was in those parts, he pay'd his Army twelve
Musters together, and hearing that his Soldiers spent most of their money in Tobacco, he forbad
the use of it, with such severity, that he caus'd their Noses and Lips to be cut off, who were
found to have taken of it,An excessive severity. contrary to the Prohibitions: and having understood,
that a Merchant, who knew not that the king had forbidden the use of Tobacco,
and brought several Bags of it into the Army, in hopes to make a greater advantage thereof
among the Soldiers, he order'd him to be set on a heap of Fagots, with all his Tobacco about
him, which being set on fire, he, and his Commodity were reduc'd to smoke and
ashes.
               After this was it that Schach-Abas went into Kilan, where he put to death his eldest Son, as
we shall relate anon. Schach-Abas had three lawfull Wives, and four or five hundred Concubines.
By his three Wives he had so many Sons, to wit, Sefi Myrsa, Chodabende Myrsa,
and Imanculi Myrsa. He ordered the two younger to have their eyes put out with fire, and
confin'd them in the Fortress of Alamuth, under a very strict Guard. The eldest Son was born
of a Christian Slave, of Georgia. This Prince having cast his Eye on a very handsom young
Maid of Circassia, whom a Merchant of Scamachie had presented to Schach-Abas, fell in Love
with her, and intreated his Father to permit he should marry her. The king who dearly lov'd
that Prince, by reason of the great complyance he had for him, consented thereto, and ordered
her to be brought up in the Seraglio, near the Mother of Sefi Myrsa, who had by her Sain Myrsa,
since king of Persia, under the name of Schach-Sefi.
               The Over-severe,Schach-Abas puts to death his eldest Son. or rather, Cruel, and Tyrannical reign of Schach-Abas, began to grow
so odious and insupportable to the Grandees of the kingdom, that some had the confidence to
cast a Note into Sefi Myrsa's Chamber, whereby they discover'd to him, that if he would
not stand in his own way, he might immediately succeed the king his Father, and that if he
would consent to the Execution of the Design they were engag'd in to that end, they would
soon show him how the business was to be effected. Sefi conceiv'd a horrour at the Proposition,
whereby he was to be a complice in his Father's death, and thereupon carried the Note to the
king, accompanying his free and innocent proceeding with so many protestations of the sincerity
of his intentions, and an absolute dependence on his Father's will, as might well satisfie any
other mind less distrustfull than that of Schach-Abas. He could not forbear expressing outwardly,
that he was very well satisfy'd with his Son, and commended his affection and piety: but
he afterwards fell into such frights, as depriv'd him of all rest, and oblig'd him to change his
Lodging twice or thrice in a night, with such disturbances, as he conceiv'd he could not be deliver'd
of otherwise than by the death of his Son. According to these apprehensions, being one
day at Rescht in the Province of Kilan, with the whole Court about him, a Flatterer so
heighten'd the distractions of his mind, by the false Alarm he gave him of a new Conspiracy
of Sefi Myrsa's, with several of the great Lords of the kingdom against him, that he resolv'd he
should dye.
               He thought, at first to employ, in that Commission Kartzschuckai-Chan, General of the Army,
or Constable of Persia, and would have oblig'd him to kill his Son with his own hands.

This Lord, was Originally descended from an Armenian Family, born by Father and Motherside
of Christians, and had been stollen away in his youth by the Tartars, who had Circumcis'd
and sold him to Schach-Abas. The freedom and sincerity of his disposition and demeanour,
had gain'd him the friendship of the whole Court, and his courage had so well setled him in the
king's favour, that having, by his means, had several great victories over his Enemies, he had
conferr'd on him the Command of his Army, and look'd upon him with such respect, that he
never call'd him by any other name than that of Aga, that is, the Captain.
               The king would needs put him upon this important service, as considering him to be the person,
who of any in his kingdom was the most oblig'd to him for his Fortune. But the grave old
Man, having laid down his Sword at the kings feet, and cast himself by it, told him, that he
was so infinitely oblig'd to his Majesty, that he would rather lose a thousand lives, than that
he should be ever reproach'd to have imbru'd his hands in the blood of any of the royal Progeny,
so far was it against his Soul to commit a Crime of that nature, and by putting to death the
Heir of the Crown, execute a command which the king could not impose upon him without regret,
and which were no sooner put in Execution, but he would repent him of it. Schach-Abas
was satisfy'd with this excuse, from him, and made the same Proposition to a Gentleman, named
Bebut-Beg, whom he found not so scrupulous as Kartzschuckai-Chan. This man having
undertaken that Commission went immediately to Sefi Myrsa, and having met him coming
out of a Bath, riding on a Mule, and accompany'd only by a single Page, layes hold on the
Bridle, stayes the Mule, and sayes, Alight, Sefi Myrsa, it is the pleasure of the king thy Father
that thou should'st die, and thereupon throws him down. The unfortunate Prince, joyning his
hands together, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven, cries out. O my God! what have I done to
deserve this disgrace? Cursed be the Traytor who is the occasion thereof. But since it is the pleasure
of God thus to dispose of me, Gods will and the King's be done.
               He had hardly the time to speak out those words, ere Bebut gave him two stabs with a
Chentze, which is a kind of Ponyard, ordinarily worn by the Persians in their Girdles, wherewith
he laid him dead upon the place. The body was dragg'd into a Fen not far thence, where
it continu'd above four hours. In the mean time, the news of this Murther being brought into
the City, the people ran in multitudes to the Palace, threatned to force the Gates, and would
have the Authors thereof deliver'd up to them, in so much that the Chans, who were afraid,
that in the fury of their first insurrection, the people would wreak their malice indifferently on
all they met, forsook the king, and got away. The Queen, Sefi Myrsa's Mother, understanding
that her Son had been kill'd by the king's express order, was so overcome with grief, that
not minding the humour of the Prince she had then to do withall, who could not endure the lest
opposition, she ran into the king's Apartment, and not thinking it enough to reproach him
with his inhumanity, and the barbarous death of an innocent Prince, and one whom he had
tenderly lov'd, she flew in his face, and beat him with her first. But the king, instead of being
angry with her, was at an absolute loss, and at last made her answer with tears in his eyes;
What would you have had me to do? News was brought me that he had a design upon my life. There
is now no remedy, what's done cannot be recall'd.
               On the other side, Schach-Abas had no sooner heard of this execution, but it repented him
of having commanded it, and express'd no small regret, that he had proceeded with so much
precipitation in a business of that importance. He thought it not enough to acknowledge it
done by his order, but would needs continue ten dayes shut up in a place where he would not see
the light of the Sun, as having all that time a Handkercher over his eyes. He liv'd a whole
moneth, and eat no more than what was purely necessary to keep him from starving. He went
in mourning a whole year, and all his life after he wore not any thing about him, that might,
as to matter of Cloaths, distinguish him from the meanest of his Subjects. And in some fort, to
eternize the memory of the Prince, he caus'd the place where he was kill'd, to be encompass'd
with a high Wall, made a Sanctuary of it, and allow'd it a certain Revenue, for the entertainment
of a great number of poor people. The first ten dayes of his greatest mourning being over,
he went from Rscht to Caswin, where he would needs entertain the Chans, whom he any
way suspected, and the Flatterer, who had made him jealous of the Prince, at a Dinner, but he
caus'd poyson to be mixt in their Wine, and kept them so long at Table till he saw them all
dead in the place.
               The action of Bebut-beg was indeed recompens'd with the charge of Daruga, of Caswin, and
some time after with that of Chan of Kesker; but he could not avoid the punishment which so
base a complyance too well deserv'd. For the first journey the king made to Caswin, after that
we spoke of before, he commanded Bebut, to go and cut off, with his own hands, his Son's
head, and to bring it him. He was forc'd to obey, and Schach-Abas seeing him coming into
the Room with his Son's head, ask'd him how he did. Bebut made answer, Alass my Liege, I
think I need not tell you; I have been forc'd with my own hands to kill my only Son, whom
I lov'd above any thing in the World; the grief I shall conceive thereat will bring me to my
Grave. The king reply'd, Go thy wayes, Bebut, and consider how great must have been my affliction,

when thou broughtst the news of my Son's death, whom I had commanded thee to put to
death. But comfort thy self, my Son and thine are no more, and reflect, that thou art in this equal
to the King thy master.
               Not long after this unhappy Paricide,Assassinate punish'd. Bebut ended his life after an extraordinary manner.
For, soon after he had taken possession of the Government of Kesker, one of his servants,
giving him water to wash after Dinner, according to the Persian custom, pour'd it on so hot
that it scalded his hands, which incens'd him so that he threatned to have him cut to pieces; but
the Slave prevented him, and considering that he who had been so barbarous as to murther his
Prince and his own Son, would make no great difficulty to rid the World of a servant, he
conspir'd with some of his Gamerades, who expected no better treatment from their Master,
and kill'd him the night following in his drink. Schach-Abas was not much troubled, that that
hatefull object was remov'd out of his sight, and would not have prosecuted the Murtherers,
had not the other Chans represented to him, that, if they were not made examples, no Lord
could think himself secure among his servants, after he had given them some theatning
language.
               But Schach-Abas's affliction, and the regret he express'd for his Son's death, how great
soever they might be, took not off the just apprehensions the Widdow conceiv'd, that he had
a design to put to death his Grand-Child Sain Myrsa. Whence it came, that she kept him a
long time conceal'd, and would not suffer him to be brought to Court, though the King, who
saw his two younger Sons, whose eyes he had caus'd to be put out, were excluded the Government,
by the Laws of the Kingdom, design'd that little Prince to succeed him. 'Tis reported
he had a great tenderness for him, and yet lest he should appear to soon, and the vivacity
of his spirit revive the affection which the people had express'd towards his Father, he endeavour'd
to have his senses dull'd, and commanded there should be given him every day about the
begness of a Pea of Opium, the use whereof is very common in Persia, as we have said elsewhere;
but that the Mother, instead of giving him that Drug, made him often take Treacle, and several
other preservatives against the poyson, which she conceiv'd she had some cause to suspect
might be given him.
               While Schach. Abas was in Kilan, Tamaras-Chan, taking advantage of his absence, entred
again with an Army into Georgia, and recover'd all those places, out of which he had been
forc'd. The King sent thither Aliculi-Ghan; Mahumed-Chan, Kasack, and Mortusaculi,
Chan of Talisch, and several other Chans, who could do no good there, but brought word
back, that they had found the Enemy so advantageously posted, that they durst not set upon
him. The King punish'd their seeming prudence with death, and went the next year in person
into Georgia, protesting at his departure, that if he return'd victorious from that VVar, he
would sell the Georgians, at an Abas, or fifteen pence a head. Upon which occasion they say
it hapned, that the King being Master of the Field, and having taken a great number of Prisoners,
a Souldier came to him, with two Abases in his hand, and desir'd him to sell him two
handsom young Maids, who were among the Prisoners, and that the King remembring his
Oath, permitted him to take his choice. It was about this time, that most of the Georgian
Christians, who liv'd at Ispahan at the time of our being there, came out of their Country to
settle themselves in the Metropolis of the Kingdom.
               Much also about the same time, was it, that Schach-Abas receiv'd Letters from Bekirkcha, who,
under the Grand-Seignor, commanded the Garrison of Bagdat or Babylon. This man,
dissatisfy'd with the Court, upon his being deny'd the Government of that place, at the Bassa's
death, under whom he had had the Lieutenancy, proffer'd Schach-Abas to deliver up the City
to him. The King hearkned to that Proposition, and immediately took his march with a good
Army towards those parts; but ere he got thither, Bikirkeha's discontent was over, so far that
he sent Schach-Abas word, that he had only Powder and Bullets at his service. He was so netled
at the affront, that he protested not to return thence till he had taken the City, though it
should cost him his life. Accordingly, having pass'd over the Ditch, after a siege of six months,
and having set fire to a Mine, which work the Persians are very excellent at, he caus'd an assault
to be given, entred the breach, and became Master of the City, without any composition.
Bikirkeha being found among the Prisoners, was sown up in a raw Ox-Hide. and in that condition
plac'd near the High-way, where the King order'd him to be sed, till such time as the heat
of the Sun having made the Hide shrink together, he died a very painful death. His Son cast
himself at Schach-Abas's feet, and satisfy'd him so far of his being wholly unconcern'd in his
Father's proceeding, that having begg'd his Pardon, he by that submission obtain'd the Government
of Schiras, which Schach-Abas made no difficulty to bestow on him; in regard that
lying at a great distance from the Frontiers of Turkey, he fear'd not his proving unfaithful to
him.
               The year following, the Emperour of the Turks caus'd Bagdat to be besieg'd, by the Bassa,
Hasis Ahmed; but Abas forc'd him to raise the siege, and continu'd eight moneths together in
sight of the Turkish Army, till such time as sickness having consum'd a great number of the

Turks, who were not so well able to endure the great heats, as the Persians, Hasis was oblig'd
to retreat to Constantinople. At his return from this expedition, Schach-Abas began to build
the Citie of Ferabath, in the Province of Mesandran, upon occasion of a Village, named Tahona,
situated upon a pleasant River, which, not far thence, falls into the Caspian Sea.
               This Victory procur'd him but two years rest. For the Turkish Emperour, desirous to recover
Bagdat, sent Chalil Bassa, with an Army of five hundred thousand men, to reduce it.
Schach-Abas commanded Cartzschugai-Chan to march to the relief of the Citie, with a small
Brigade, but consisting of choice men, and he follow'd him in person, with the whole Army.
He himself got into the Citie, and sent Kartzschugai-Chan to meet the Turk, whom he wearied
out with perpetual skirmishes for six moneths together. At last he gave him battel, disorder'd,
and defeated him, forcing him to fly as far as Netzed. Upon the first news of the Victory,
Schach-Abas left the Citie, to go and meet Kartzschugai-Chan, and being come neer him
alighted, and said to him; My dearest Aga, I have by thy means and conduct obtain'd so
noble a Victory, that I would not have desir'd a greater of God, come, get up on my Horse,
'tis fit I should be thy Lackey. Kartzschugai was so surpriz'd at this discourse, that he cast
himself at his feet, intreated his Majesty to look on him as his slave, and not to expose him to
the derision of all the World, by doing him an honour so extraordinary, as that it was impossible
he could any way deserve it. But notwithstanding all his intreaties, he was forc'd to get
up, the King and the Chans following on foot, onely seven paces. Schach-Abas had many
other Wars against the Turks; but the most signal Victory he ever got over his Enemies, was
at the reduction of the Citie of Ormus, which he recover'd from the Portuguez, six years before
his death. Of that an account shall be given in the subsequent Travels of Mandelslo.
               About the end of the year 1629. he took a journey to Ferabath, in the Province of Mesanderan,
which was the place he most delighted in of any in his Kingdom; but he there fell so
ill, that, perceiving he should not escape, he sent for four Lords of the chiefest of his Councel,
to wit, Isa-Chan, Kurtzibaschi, Seiul-Chan, Tuschmal, or Councellor of State, Temerbey,
Ouwogly, or Lord High-Steward, and Iusuf Aga, chief Gentleman of his Chamber, who
being come to his Bed-side, he told them. That, firmly believing the sickness he was then in
would be his last, it was his pleasure, that his Grand-Child, Sain Myrsa, should succeed
him, and assume his Father's name, obliging them all solemnly to promise him, that, after
his death, they would religiously execute his Last Will. The Astrologers had told Schach-Abas,
that Sain should reign but eight moneths at most; but when these Lords would have
spoke to him of that Prediction, the King made answer, Let him reign as long as he can, though
it were but three dayes; it will be some satisfaction to me, to be assur'd, that he shall one day have
on his head the Crown which was due to the Prince his Father.
               'Twas conceiv'd, he had had some poyson given him, upon which presumption the Hakim
Iusuf, his Physician, order'd him hot bathing for eight dayes together, and for four dayes
afterward another kind of Bath, of Cows milk: but all these remedies being either ineffectual,
or too weak, he seriously prepar'd himself for death, even to the appointing of the place where
he would be interr'd. But that the people might not certainly know it, he commanded the Ceremonies
of his Funeral should be Celebrated in three several places, at the same time, to wit,
at Ardebil, Mesched, and Babylon; but the more general report is, that the body was carried
to Babylon, and thence to the Netzef, of Kufa, neer the Sepulchre of Aly, upon this accompt,
that Schach-Abas, going to Kufa, soon after the reduction of Babylon, and looking on the
Netzef, said, he had never seen a more delightfull place, and that he should wish to be there
interr'd after his death. What ere became of his body, certain it is that he dy'd, in the year
1629. having liv'd 63. years, and reign'd 45. He discover'd the strength of his memory and
understanding, in the order he took, at his death, that it might be kept secret, till his Grand-Child
were assur'd of the Succession; commanding that they should expose his body every day
in the same Hall, where he was wont to administer Justice, set in a Chair of State, with his
eyes open, his back turn'd to the Hangings, behind which stood Iusuf Aga, who ever and anon
made him lift up his Arm, by means of a silk string, and answer'd those things which were proposed
by Temir-beg, on the behalf of such as were at the other end of the Hall, and who were
thereby perswaded that Schach-Abas was still alive. This was so well personated, that his death
was conceal'd, for the space of six weeks.
               The Persians have a Veneration for the memory of this Prince,The Persians honour the memory, of Schach-Abas. and speak of him as of the
greatest King that Persia hath had these many ages. And indeed, take but out of his life, the
examples of cruelty we have touch'd at before, it must be acknowledg'd, that, if we may not
number him among the good, yet must we assign him a place among the greatest Princes, of any
mentioned in the modern Histories. He was Wise and Valiant, and hath heightned the glory of
Persia by the great Victories he obtain'd over his Enemies, extending by that means the Territories
of his Kingdom of all sides, towards the Indians, the Turks and the Tartars. The Augustine
Friers told us, that, he was so far from having any aversion for Christian Religion,
that, on the contrary, he often came to their Monastery, made them Dine with him, sent for

                  
                  

                  
them in the night, put their Beads about his Neck, sighing, and saying, that he knew not
which Religion he should embrace, and discoursing very familiarly with them. He had a great
sence of the miseries of the Poor, and took a particular care for their subsistence. Whence it
came that it was ordinary with him, after his departure out of some Citie to return into it again
incognito, to go to the Market, and to examine their weights, and the goodness of their Bread
and other Provisions, severely punishing such as he found guilty of any Circumvention. Being
one day at Ardebil, he ordered to be put into a red hot Oven, a certain rich Baker, who refus'd
to sell Bread to the Poor, under pretence that he was oblig'd to keep it for Abas, and
his Soldiers, who, as he said, could never be satisfy'd; and he caus'd to be fasten'd, by the
back, to the hooks on which the Mear had hung, a Butcher, whose weights had been found
too light. He took a pleasure in bestowing, in Alms, the money he got from publick places,
as being perswaded they could not be acceptable to God, if that sacrifice were made of that
money which is taken from the people. He could not endure those Judges who receiv'd money
on either side, and severely punish'd such as were guilty of Concussions, and manifest injustice.
For, coming to understand that a Kasi, or Judge of Ispahan, after he had taken Presents from
both sides, to wit, some 70. l. sterl. from each, would have perswaded them to come to accommodation,
he ordered him to be set on an Ass, with his face towards the tayl, which serv'd
him for a Bridle, and upon his Judge's Robe caus'd to be put the Entrails of a Sheep newly
kill'd, cut in several places, and in that posture he made him take several turns about the Maydan;
having it cry'd before him, that this should be the punishment of a corrupt Judge.
               While Temir-beg,Schach-Sefi succeeds his Grandfather. and Iusuf Aga, expos'd, at Ferabath, the Carkase of Schach-Abas,
as we said before Seinel-Chan made all the haste he could to Ispahan, whither he brought the
news of the King's death to the Daruga, Chofrou Myrsa, and having consulted with him about
the means they should use to advance Sain Myrsa to the Throne, they went together to the
Appartment of the Princess, his Mother, which is called Taberick-kale, and intreated her to
put the young Prince into their hands. The Mother, who still had before her eyes the violent
death of her Husband, believing it was some fiction, and that they had order from Schach-Abas
to Murther the Prince, lock'd her self up in her Chamber, and made all passages so fast, that
these two Lords being out of all hopes to perswade her, and being afraid to let slip the opportunity
of executing the deceas'd Kings last Will, after they had lain three dayes at the Princesse's
Chamber door, sent her word, that if she would not open, they should be forc'd to break it.
Upon this message she at last opened the door, and presented to them the Prince her Son; but,
conceiving it was in order to his present execution, with these words; Go child to the same place
where thy Father is, here are the murtherers ready to dispatch thee. But when she saw those Lords
prostrate themselves, and kissing the Prince's feet, her fright was turn'd into perfect joy. The
Lords conducted the Prince to the Palace-Royal, where they set him in the Divan-Chane, upon
a Table of stone, on which were as many Carpets, (which they call (Kalitse Ahdalet, or
Carpets of Justice) as there had been Kings of Persia of his Family, (in as much as every King,
at his first coming to the Crown, causes one to be made for him) and having sent for all the
Chans and Lords who were about Ispahan, they Crown'd him, kiss'd his feet, and wishing him
a long and happy Reign, setled him in the Throne of his Ancestors.
               Immediately after the Ceremonies of his Coronation, he took the name of Sefi, according
to the desire of Schach-Abas, and bestow'd on the Chosrou Myrsa the Dignity of Chan, with
the name of Rustam, as desirous, by that means, to revive, in his person, the memory of the
great Heroe, so highly Celebrated in their Histories and Romances.
               It is reported that Schach-Sefi came into the World with his hands all bloody,The beginning of his reign cruel, and that
Schach-Abas, his Grand-Father, hearing of it, said, that that Prince should often bath his
hands in blood. Accordingly, till the time of our Embassy, his reign had been so cruel and
bloody, that Persia had not, for many ages before, seen so many executions. For immediately
upon his coming to the Crown, he follow'd the counsel of the Chancellor, Predecessor to him
whom we knew, and made away Rustan-Chan, whom he had made Generalissimo of the Armies
of Persia, and Governour of Tiflis, and several other Lords, and caus'd to be cut in pieces,
or kill'd with his own hands, all his own relations, and what other persons soever he was any
way distrustfull of, by that means so accustoming himself to blood, that, when he was incens'd,
he spar'd none, and kill'd or order'd to be kill'd, upon trivial occasions, such as he
was any way displeas'd with. I shall here produce a few examples thereof, that the Reader may,
by them, as a Pattern, judge of the rest of his life.
               He began his cruelties, by an onely Brother, though born of a Concubine, whose eyes he
caus'd to be put out. Chodabende, and Imanculi Myrsa his Uncles, younger brethren to Sefi
Myrsa, whom Schach-Abas, their Father, had confin'd in the Castle of Alamuth, thirty
Leagues from Caswin, after he had put out their eyes as we said before, were cast down headlong
from a high Rock, for this reason, as Sefi said, that, having lost the benefit of their sight,
they were useless in the World. Afterwards he dispatch'd Isa-Chan, his Uncle, after he had
cut off the heads of his three Sons, upon the following occasion.
               
                  
Isa-Chan was so much in favour with Schach-Abas, that the King, willing to make it appear
what extraordinary respect he had for him, bestow'd on him his Daughter, by whom he had the
three Sons,Kills another Vncle and his three Sons. whom Sefi put to death. She was a very handsom Woman, and of a pleasant conversation,
insomuch that Schach-Sefi, her Nephew, was extremely taken with her company.
This Princess, being one day with the king, took the freedom to jeast with him, and to tell
him, she much wondred, that he, who was so young and vigorous, and had so many great
beauties to command, could get no Children, whereas she had had three by her Husband.
The king made answer, that he was young, and having, as he hoped, many years to reign,
there would be time enough to get Heirs to inherit the Crown after him. But the Princess
desirous to keep on the jeast, reply'd, that, ground not well cultivated would hardly
bring forth any thing, imprudently adding, You speak very well, my Liege, but I fear me,
that after your death the Persians will be glad to pitch upon one of my Sons to succeed you.
The king was extremely troubled at the boldness and bitterness of the jeast, but made a shift to
dissemble it, and to get out of the Room, without the Princesse's perceiving that he was incens'd
against her.
               The next day, the King commanded the three Sons of Isa-Chan to be brought to him; the
eldest was 22. years of age, the second 15. and the third 9. and having convey'd them into a
a Garden, he caus'd their heads to be cut off, and at Dinner time having dispos'd the three heads
into one of those cover'd Pots, in which the Persians bring the Rice and Meat to be set on the
Table, and sending for the Mother, he order'd them to be taken out one after another, by the
Nose, and said to the Princess; See the children of a Woman who bragg'd so much of her fertility;
go, thou art young enough to bear more of them. The Princess was so astonish'd at that horrid
Spectacle, that she was not able to speak a word; but perceiving in the Kings eyes and countenance
the eruptions of his indignation, which she imagin'd might break forth to her unavoidable
death, she cast her self at his feet, kiss'd them, and said to him, All is well, all is well;
God grant the King a long and happy life. This forc'd complyance sav'd her life. But as soon as
she had left the Room, Sefi sent for Isa-Chan, and pointing with his finger to the heads of his
Children, ask'd him what he thought of that pleasant Spectacle. Isa-Chan, who knew what
humour the Prince was of, and whom he had to do withall, smother'd the tenderness of a paternal
affection, and made answer, that he was so far from being displeas'd thereat, that if the
King had commanded him, to bring the heads of his Sons, he would have been the Executioner
himself, and that he would have no Children, if the Kings pleasure were it should be otherwise.
This base and bruitish flattery sav'd Isa-Chan's life at that time; but the King reflecting,
that he could not be faithfull to him, at lest that it was impossible he should love him, after he
had been so treated by him, gave order his head should be also cut off.
               We said before,Kills Seinel-Chan with his own hands. that Isa-Chan was one of those who had most contributed to the advancement
of Schach-Sefi to the Throne of his Predecessors. Seinel-Chan had also done much in that
business; whence it came he was not to expect any better treatment than the other, from him
whom he had rais'd to a condition to commit so many inhumane actions. Schach-Sefi, having
forc'd the Turks, to raise the siege they had lay'd before Bagdat in the year 1632. encamp'd
with his Army near Hemedan, at which place, several Lords, reflecting on the executions
wherewith the King had signaliz'd the beginning of his reign, said among themselves, that since
in his tender age, he could commit so many cruelties, it was likely he would in time, extirpate
all the Grandees of Persia. Seinel-Chan, who was present at this discourse, went immediately
to the King, and gave him an account of what had past in that conference, advising him to rid
himself of those who had most credit among them, and so secure his own life. The King made
him answer; Thy advice, Seinel-Chan, is so good, that I will immediately follow it; and I will
begin with thee; for thou art the person of greatest age and most authority among them, and must
needs be of the conspiracy. And I shall in that follow the example of the King, my Grand-Father,
whose reign was neither safe nor happy, till he had executed him, who had the same charge of Kurtzibachi,
which thou now enjoyest. Seinel-Chan reply'd, that that would be no hard matter for
him to do; that, for his part, he was arriv'd to the greatest age man could attain, and that it
would not trouble him much, his life should be shortned some few dayes: but that his Majesty
would haply one day be troubled, that he had put to death one of his most faithfull servants,
and that he should rather consider the importance of the discovery he had made to him,
and the earnestness he had therein express'd to serve him. This answer delay'd the execution of
what the king had resolv'd to do; so that he thereupon went to his Mother, who had follow'd
him in his expedition, with the other Ladies of the Seraglio, according to the antient custom
of Persia, to acquaint her with what he had heard. The next morning the Princess sent for
Seinel-Chan to her Tent door, to hear from him all the circumstances of that Conspiracy, but
as soon as the king heard that Seinel-Chan had spoken to his Mother, he was so incens'd thereat,
that he went and kill'd him with his own hands, in the presence of the Princess.
               This certainly was one of the greatest persons in the kingdom, who ought his fortune to his
conduct, and the trust wherewith he had serv'd Schach-Abas in several affairs of great importance;
whereof we shall here allege only one example.
               
                  
Schach-Abas being to send a solemn Embassy to Lahor, to the Great Mogul, about the differences
there were between them for the Frontiers of Candahar, would needs employ in it
Seinel Chan, as being the person, whom, of all his Ministers, he repos'd greatest confidence in;
and as he took leave of him in order to his departure, he said to him: For this employment, I
have made choice of thee, Seinel, out of the assurance I have of thy fidelity, whereof I expect the
utmost demonstration in this Embassy. For as this shirt sticks close to my back, so would I have
thee to be so tenderly concern'd in my interests, that thou do no thing in this charge that may be prejudicial
either to my reputation or my service. Seinel-Chan promis'd him his utmost care, and
was as good as his word. For being come to the Moguls Court, he refus'd doing him reverence,
according to the custom of the Countrey, by putting both hands first to the ground,
and afterwards upon his head, but he entred the Room with a grave and setled gate, and only
saluted the king with his Salomalek. The Indian Prince was so troubled at it, that he sent to
intreat him to demean himself otherwise, and to render him the same respects, as the Ambassadors
of Persia were wont to approach him withall. Nay, he would have prevail'd with him
to do it, by the proffers he caus'd to be made him of several considerable Presents; but perceiving,
that nothing would work with him, he bethougth him, to make, opposite to his Throne,
a Door so low, that Seinel-Chan could not come in at without stooping, and consequently not
avoid doing him reverence. But Seinel-Chan found means to elude that Artifice, and entred the
king's Chamber backwards, so that the first part that came within the Door was his britch.
This irreverence put the Mogul out of all patience; so that, he not only forbore making him
those Presents, which are ordinarily made Ambassadors, and in those parts are of no small value,
but also forbad his people to supply him with the ordinary Provisions; which reduc'd
him to such extremities, that he was forc'd to sell his Plate, and what ever there was of Gold
or Silver about the Saddles and Trappings of his Horses, to subsist. The Mogul made his complaints
to Schach-Abas, of this demeanour of Seinel Chan, and the king pretended to be troubled
at the little respect he had rendred the Mogul; but he made it appear, on the contrary, that
he was well satisfy'd with his behaviour towards that Industhan Prince. For not long after he
honour'd him with the Title of Chan, and bestow'd on him the Government of Hemedan, Terkisin,
Kulpcjan, &c. to be enjoy'd by him during his life, but upon condition, he should be alwayes
about the Court, as having one of the chiefest places in the Councel.
               Seinel-Chan being thus kill'd, the Princess, Schach-Sefi's Mother; who conceiv'd a horrour
thereat, represented to him how much he was to blame, for treating in that manner one of his
Grand-Father's most antient servants, one that had done himself so great services at his comming
to the Crown; and the king seem'd to be somewhat troubled thereat. But he reflected
not much on those Lectures, since that not many dayes after, the Chancellor, the Lord high
Steward, nay, his own Mother found not better treatment from him; as may be seen in the
following relation.
               The king being,Puts to death his Chancellor and others. during the foresaid expedition, encamped in the Mountain of Sehend, within
a League of Tauris, and the Lord High Steward, named Vgurlu-Chan, being one day to
command the Guard about the king, at which the Chans are oblig'd to be personally present,
when the king is in the field, it was his misfortune to go and Sup with Tabub-Chan, Chancellor
of the kingdom, who had also invited the Dawatter, that is, the Secretary of the Closet,
whose name was Hassan-beg, and a certain Poet. Supper being near ended, the Kischitzi-baschi,
that is, the Captain of the Guard, named Mortusaculi-Chan, came to give Vgurlu-Chan
notice, that it was time to come to the king's Tent. But the Chancellor, unwilling to dismiss
his Guests, sent away the Kischitzi-baschi, and told him that there was no great necessity of
Vgurla-Chan's being there in person, and that the king, being but a Child, would take no notice
of Vgurla's absence, and so he might set the Guard well enough without him.
               The Captain reiterated his instances for his coming away, and press'd the high Steward to
come and do his duty, and told him, that otherwise he should be oblig'd to make his complaints
thereof to the king. The Chancellor, importun'd with this discourse, commanded his
people to thrust Mortusaculi-Chan out of Doors; which they did, but so roughly, that he was
hurt in the face. He went, all bloody as he was, to the king, and gave him an account of what
had pass'd at the Chancellor's. The king commanded him to say nothing of it: but the next
day, the Chancellor being at Dinner with the king, and sitting in his ordinary place, the king
having commanded him to come near, said to him; What does he deserve, who, eating the
bread, and living by the pure favour of his Master, is so far from paying the respect due to him,
that he slights him? The Chancellor made him answer, he deserves death. Whereto the king
reply'd, Thou hast pronounced thy own sentence; Thou art the person, who living only by
my favour, and eating at my Table, hast had the insolence to treat me as a Child, in the discourse
that pass'd yesterday, between thee and Mortusaculi-Chan. The Chancellor would
have justify'd himself; but the king not giving him the time to do it, run him into the belly
with his Cymitar. The Chancellor, as he fell down, only cry'd out, Ha Padschach-Aimahn,
and the king commanded his Rika, who are a part of his Guard who carry Pole-Axes, and many

times do the work of Executioners, to cut his head into little bits. There happened to be one
of the Pages, who conceiving a horror at that cruelty, turn'd aside, and would not look on it,
which the king observing, laid to him; since thy sight is so tender, it will be of no great use to
thee, and commanded his eyes to be immediately put out.
               The Execution of Tabub-Chan was soon follow'd by that of Vgurlu-Chan, who receiv'd his
by the king's command, from the hands of Aliculi-Chan, Divanbeg, or President of the Counsel,
who was sent to bring him his head. Vgurlu was coming out of the Bath, and going to
put on his Cloaths when Aliculi-Chan came to him. Vgurlu seeing him coming in, attended
by two servants, was a little startled at it, though they were very good friends, and said to
him, Wo is me! dear friend, I fear thou bringst me no good news. Aliculi-Chan made answer,
Thou art in the right, my dear Brother, the king hath commanded me to bring him thy
head, the only way is to submit; whereupon he clos'd with him, cut off his head, made a
hole in one of the cheeks, thrust his finger through it, and so carry'd it to the king, who looking
on it, touch'd it with a little Wand, and said; It must be confess'd thou wert a stout man,
it troubles me to see thee in that condition, but it was thine own fault; `tis pitty, were it
only for that goodly beard of thine. This he said, by reason his Mustachoes were so long, that,
coming about his neck, they met again at his mouth, which is accounted a great Ornament in
Persia.
               Mortusaculi had his charge conferr'd on him. Hassan-beg, who had also been at the Chancellor's
Feast, receiv'd the same treatment; and the Poet, who was afterwards fasly accus'd
of having put this Execution in Verse, and sung them in the Maidan, was conducted to that
place, where they cut off his Nose, Ears, Tongue, Feet, and Hands, whereof he died some few
dayes after.
               Not long after this Execution, the king sent for the Sons of these Lords, and said to them;
You see, I have destroy'd your Fathers, what say you of it? Vgurlu-Chan's Son said very resolutely,
what do's a Father signifie to me? I have no other than the king. This unnatural answer
restor'd him to the Estate of the deceas'd, which otherwise would have been Confiscated
to the king: but the Chancellor's Son was reduc'd to great misery, and had not any thing allow'd
him of all his Father had enjoy'd, for his expressing a greater Resentment of his death,
than Complyance for the king.
               The king, being come to Caswin, issued out his commands, that all the Lords and Governours
of Provinces should come to Court. They all obey'd this order, save only Alymerdan-Chan,
Governour of Candahar, and Daub-Chan, Governour of Kentze, who thought it enough
to assure the king of their fidelity, by sending him, each of them, one of their Wives, and one
of their Children, as Hostages; but the king thought not that submission sufficient; whereupon
Alymerdan-Chan absolutely revolted, and put his person and the Fortress of Candahar under
the Protection of the king of the Indies. Daub-Chan, understanding by the Achta, or Groom
of the king's Chamber, who had been sent to him, how dangerous it were for him to come to
Court, took the advice of his friends, and resolv'd to retire into Turkey. To effect his design,
he thought good to try how his servants stood affected towards him, and having found there
were fifteen among them who were unwilling to follow him, he caus'd them to be cut to pieces
in his presence, writ a very sharp Letter to the king, and carried away all his Wealth along with
him, to Tamaras-Chan, a Prince of Georgia, his Brother-in-law, and went thence into Turkey,
where he still liv'd at the time of our Embassy, and was much respected by Sulthan Ibrahim, Emperour
of Constantinople. The king, to be reveng'd of both, sent their Wives to the houses
of publick prostitution, and expos'd the Son of Daud-Chad to the brutality of the Grooms
about the Court, and the common Executioners of the City; but Alymerdan's Son, by reason
of his beauty, was reserv'd for the king's own use.
               Sometime afterwards, the king sent orders to Imanculi-Chan, Governour of Schiras, Brother
to Daud-Chan, to come to Court. He had notice sent him of the intention the king had to
put him to death: but he made answer, that he could not be perswaded they would treat him so
ill, after he had done such considerable services to the Crown: but however it might happen, he
would rather lose his life, than be out of favour with his Prince, and become a Criminal by his
disobedience.
               According to this imprudent resolution, he came to Caswin, where the Court then was;
but he was no sooner come, ere the king ordered his head to be taken off. Schach-Sefi intended
to save the lives of Imanculi's Children, and, no doubt had done it, had it not been for the ill
Office which was rendred them by a wicked Parasite, who, seeing the eldest Son of them at
the king's feet, aged about 18. years, his friends it seems having advis'd him to make
that submission, told his Majesty, that he was not the Son of Imanculi, but of Schach-Abas,
who had bestow'd one of his Concucines in marriage on the Father, being before hand with
Child by him.
               That word occasion'd the death of that young Lord, and fourteen of his Brethren, who being
conducted to the Maidan, were all beheaded near their Father's body. The Mother made a

shift to get away, with the sixteenth, into Arabia, to her own Father's, who was a Prince
of those parts, and as we were told. he was living at that time, and had his Habitation at
Helbise, three dayes journey from Besre, or Balsara.
               The bodies of these executed persons remain'd three dayes in the Maidan in the open air, till
that the King, fearing the lamentations, which the Mother of Imanculi made there day and
night, would have rais'd the people into an insurrection, commanded them to be taken away.
               The Persians do still bemoan the death of this Imanculi-Chan, out of a remembrance of his
liberality. He was the Son of Alla-Werdi-Chan, who, upon his own charge, built the Bridge
of Ispahan, and who was as much look'd on as any Lord in Persia, for the noble actions he had
done in the Wars.
               The King's cruelty was as great towards the Ladies, as his inhumanity towards the men. For,
about that time he kill'd one with his own hands, and committed several other murthers. When
he intended any Execution, he was ordinarily clad in Skarlet, or some red stuff, so that all
trembled when he put on any thing of that colour. These unheard of cruelties frightned all that
came neer him, and put some upon a resolution to shorten his dayes by poyson: but that which
they gave him prov'd not strong enough, so that he escap'd the effects of it with a sickness of
two moneths. As soon as he was recover'd, he caus'd and exact enquiry to be made, whereby
it was discover'd, by means of a Woman belonging to the Seraglio, who had been ill-treated
by her Mistress, that the poyson had been prepar'd in the appartment of the Women,
and that his Aunt, Isa-Chan's Wife, had caus'd it to be given him. He reveng'd himself sufficiently
the night following: for the Seraglio was full of dreadfull cries and lamentations, and
it was found the next day, that he had caus'd a great Pit to be made in the Garden, wherein he
had buried forty Women alive, whereof some were Ladies of the Seraglio, others their servants,
and such as attended on them. It was also much about the same time, that a rumour
was spread abroad, that his Mother dy'd of the Plague; but it is more likely the accompany'd
the forty Ladies, who had been buried alive, as we said before.
               He express'd, when occasion requir'd, courage enough, and it is certain the beginning of
his reign was remarkable for the great Victories he gain'd over his Enemies.He press'd more terity than courage in his actions. He defeated Karib-Schach
in the Province of Kilan. He forc'd the Turks to raise the siege of Bagdat, and took
by asault the Fortress of Eruan; though, to speak impartially, the glory of these good successes
be due to the Valour and Conduct of his Generals, and to fortune rather than his prudence:
for he discover'd not much in any of his actions, which were for the most part temerarious,
and without any dependence one of another. To prove this, we need onely instance
the reduction of Eruan.
               The King, finding that, after a siege of four moneths, his affairs were little advanc'd, fell
into that impatience and despair, that he would go in person upon the assault of the place,
saying, he would rather dye in the in the attempt, than with infamy rise from a place, which
the Turks had heretofore taken in three dayes. He had already put on the Cloaths of one of his
Foot-men, that he might not be distinguish'd from others, and had given order for the storming
of the Place, when the Lords, who durst not contradict him, intreated the Princess, his
Mother, to represent to him, how impossible it was to take a place before there was a breach
made, and that the danger whereto he would expose himself, would have no other effect, than
his own death and ignominy, with the destruction of the whole Army. All the answer she
could get to these representations, was, a good box o'th'ear, the King being still bent upon
his former resolution of assaulting the Place, and to that purpose he had taken a Pole-Ax in his
hand to lead them on. But the principal Lords cast themselves at his feet, and intreated him to
grant them but one day more, wherein they promis'd to do all that lay in the power of men
against the Place. They obtain'd their desire, order'd the Whole Army to fall on, even to the
boys, and carried the Place by storm; but they lost in the action above fifty thousand men.
               The good success, which till that time had attended his designs, soon chang'd, after the executions
of so many great persons as he had put to death: and of this there was a remarkable instance
in the loss of Bagdat, which the Persians were not able to maintain against the Turks,
who recover'd it out of their hands, twenty six years after they had taken it from them.
               The onely good action he did during his whole reign, is, that he sent back to their several
Habitations those poor people whom Schach-Abas had taken out of Eruan, Nachtzuan, Chaletz,
and Georgia, to the number of seven thousand, and had brought to Ferabath, where they were
employ'd in great buildings, and liv'd in a miserable slavery: yet were there not above three
hundred that made their advantage of this good deed of his, all the rest having perish'd through
misery, and been starv'd.
               He took great pleasure in drinking,Subject  wine. and had a great kindness for such as bore him Company
in that exercise: but his ordinary divertisements were Women and Hunting, not much minding
matters of Government, or the administration of Justice to his Subjects.
               He had three lawfull Wives,His Wives??? one whereof was the Daughter of a Colonel; whose employment
it had sometime been to drive the Mules which brought water to the King's Kitchin, and

came to be known to Schach-Abas, by a service he did him one day while he was Hunting, in
helping him to some fair water, the weather being extremely hot, when no other could meet
with any. This service was requited by the Present the King made him of the Village of Bilou,
neer Nachtzuan, where this Mule-driver had been born. This was the first step or his advancement,
and what made him noted at Court, where he found means to get an Office, which
is no hard matter in Persia for such as have money, and having some time after taken an employment
in the Wars, he prov'd so fortunate therein, that he got the command of a Regiment of
a thousand men. Schach-Abas thought his Daughter so handsom, that he made a Present of her
to his Daughter-law, Sefi-Myrsa's Widdow, and appointed her to be brought up in order
to a Marriage between her and his Son Sain-Myrsa, since named Schach-Sefi, who, at his
coming to the Crown, accordingly Married her.
               The second Wife was a Christian, the Daughter of Tameras-Chan, a Prince of Georgia; and
this Marriage confirm'd the Peace which Schach-Abas made with that Prince.
               The third was a Tartar of Circassia, the Daughter of Bika, and Sister to Prince Mussal,
of whom we have often spoken heretofore. The Mother brought her as far as the River Bustrou,
at the time of our Travels, and writ to Schach-Sefi, that she sent him her Daughter, not as a
Concubine, or Slave; but as his lawfull Wife; That is was her hope he would look on her as
such, and that she should find from him a kindness and affection equal to that she her self had
express'd towards the Princess, his Mother, who, though she had been her Slave and had
often undress'd her even to her Stockins, had been treated, and look'd on by her, as if she had
been her own Daughter; That, on the contrary, rather than her Daughter should be ill treated,
she wish'd her drown'd, with all the misfortune that might happen to her, in the River Bustrou.
               Besides these lawfull Wives,His Concubines. he had above three hundred Concubines; for, all the handsomest
Maids all over Persia were brought to him. The greatest Lords themselves Present him
with the Maids they either have brought up in their own houses, or are found among their relations.
Of this we had an instance in our time in the Calenter of Scamachie, who having had
some ill Offices done him at the Court, recover'd the King's favour, by presenting him with his
own Neece, one of the greatest beauties of the Countrey, and a sum of money sent to the
Chancellor.
               The Armenians, to prevent the searches which are often made amongst them for Maids of
twelve years of age, dispose of them in Marriage, if they are handsom, before they come to
that age. By reason of this great number of Concubines, it happens, that the King lies with
some of them but once, and then bestows them on those Lords of the Court who are most in
his favour.
               Schach-Sefi dy'd in the year MDCXLII.His death: in the twelfth year of his reign, or, to speak
more truely, his Tyranny. 'Tis conceiv'd his life was shortned by poyson, as the onely remedy
they could make use of against his cruelties, which they must needs be afraid of, who
had so many examples thereof perpetually before their eyes, wherein they sound that neither
Age nor Sex could secure any person from his inhumanities. As to his person, there was nothing
of this cruelty to be read in his countenance, but on the contrary it was amiabe, of a
mild aspect, and his complexion so good as gave but little grounds to infer he had so barbarous
a heart. He was of a mean stature, and very well shap'd as to his person, and at the time of
our Embassy,Schach-Abas succeeds his Father. he had but one Son, named Abas, who succeeded him in May the same year
1642. being then but 13. years of age: and he it is who now reigns.
               The Kings of Persia have the Provinces and Cities of their Kingdom Govern'd by Chans, Sulthans,
Calenters, Darugas, Visirs, and Kauchas, dignities and employments which are conferr'd
there according to valour and virtue, and not in consideration of birth and extraction.
Thence it comes that there are so many persons of such resolute courage, that they cheerfully
hazard their lives, as knowing it is the onely way to get into the greatest charges of the Kingdom,
which are neither hereditary nor venal in Persia. 'Tis true, the Children of these Lords
are look'd upon,Dignities not Hereditary. with some respect to their Fathers, and that they enjoy their Estates,
but they are never advanc'd to their dignities, but purely upon the account of worth and
services, from which they are inseparable. The King never makes any Chan, but with the
title, he gives him where withall to maintain it, and that during his life, which many of them
lose meerly that they might be depriv'd of their quality.
               Every Province hath its Chan, and its Calenter, who have their several Habitations in the
chief City. The Chan is as it were the Governor of the Province, and is entrusted with the
administration of Justice, with the power of putting his Judgements in Execution, notwithstanding
any Appeal. The Calenter hath the over-sight of the King's Demesn, and the Revenues
of the Province, which he receives, and gives an account thereof to the Council, or, by
order from the King, to the Chan. The Daruga is, in a Citie, and the Kaucha, in a Village,
what the Chan is in respect of the Province. The Daruga do's also Execute the Function of
the Calenter in his Jurisdiction, but with a dependence on the Governour of the Province.
The King employes the Chans and Sulthans in the Embassies he sends to forein Princes???

but they are not so chargeable to him as some conceive, in regard he finds but one half of the
Presents which the Ambassador carries along with him, the Province, whereof he is Governour,
being oblig'd to defray all the rest of the Charge.
               Most of the Chans are oblig'd to maintain a certain number of Soldiers, who are to be ready
to serve in the Armies, when any occasion requires: and in this is all the Revenue of the Province
spent, not including what is rais'd by way of Imposition, which is carried into the Exchecquer.
Besides that, they also send the King certain New-years-Gifts, which are very considerable.
The Provinces and Cities, which have no Chans, and are Governed by a Daruga,
as part of Georgia, the Cities of Caswin, Ispahan, Kascham, Theheram, Hemedan, Mesched,
Kirman, Ormus, &c. maintain no Soldiers, but pay Taxes to the King. The order
they observe, especially in the Frontier-Provinces, for the subsistence of so great a number of
Soldiers, is such, that it is no hard matter to raise a powerfull Army in a short time. And
indeed this the Schach makes very much his advantage of against the Potent Enemies he hath
about him, and by whom he is in a manner encompass'd of all sides, as the Vsbeques Tartars,
the Turks and Indians. He is never at quiet with the former, concerning the Frontiers of Chorasan;
with the Mogul, about those of Candahar, and with the Turk, about the Provinces
of Bagdat and Eruan, for which they are in perpetual War, whence it comes that they often
change Masters.
               Their Armies consist onely of Horse;The Persian Army consists onely of Horse. for the Infantery, which is, upon occasion, to serve
on foot, is, in its march, mounted as our Dragoons. The ordinary Arms of the Foot are
Musquets; but the Horse are Arm'd onely with Darts and Javelins. They have us'd Muskets
and great Guns but since the reign of Schach-Abas, nor do they use the latter so much in the
assault as defence of places; in as much as their Armies making ordinarily great dayes marches,
and with little or no Carriages, it would be troublesom to them to take great Guns along with
them, as such as would much retard their Expeditions. No slight or stratagem in War but they
are apt enough to make their advantage of. At the siege of Iruan, in the year 1633. they had
the invention of casting into the place, with their Arrows, small Glasses full of poyson, which
so infected the air, that the Garrison was extremely incommodated thereby, and made incapable
of handling their Arms,Their Military Offices. for the defence of the place. They call the General of the Army
Serdar, a Colonel of ten or twelve thousand Horse Kurtzibaschi, him, who commands a
thousand men, Minbaschi, a Captain of a hundred men, Iusbaschi, and a Leader up of ten
men, Ohnbaschi.
               At the time of our being there, all the Military Commanders were persons of very mean extraction.
               Arb, Schan of Schiruan was the son of a poor Countrey-man of Serab, and his first employment
had been in the Train of Artillery, wherein he made such Discoveriers of his Conduct
and Courage, that Schach-Abas bestow'd on him that Government, which is one of the
most considerable in the Kingdom.
               Aga-Chan was the Son of a Shepheard neer Merrage. This man ordered his business so
well, at the siege of Wan, that his services were recompens'd with the Government of his
Countrey.
               Kartzschucai-Chan, was the Son of a Christian, of Armenia, and had been sold to Schach-Abas,
who made him a Chan, and afterwards General of his Army. He acquir'd so great reputation
in that employment, that the Schach himself would needs be his Lacquey, as we said
elsewhere.
               Salma-Chan, a Kurde by birth, had some time been an ordinary Groom.
               Emir-Kune-Chan was the Son of one of that kind of Shepheards, who live in Tents or Huts
upon the Mountains, & grew so famous at the siege of Eruan, that the King entrusted him with
the Government of the whole Province. What a particular kindness Schach-Abas had for this
person, may be guess'd by the ensuing story.
               The Turks, who lay before the Citie of Eruan, having rais'd the siege, Schach-Abas got
into the place, where he spent the best part of the night in drinking with Emir-Kune, wo grew
so familiar with him, that taking the King by the Mustachoes, he kiss'd his very mouth, yet
did not the King take it any way unkindly. Emir-Kune who remembred not what he had
done in his Wine, was much astonish'd when some gave him an accompt of what had pass'd the
next day, and so frightned thereat, that hanging his Cytimar about his Neck, he went in that
posture to the King's Chamber door, according to the custom observ'd by such as know they
have deserv'd death, and by that submission beg their Pardon. The King sent him word he
might come in, whereto the other having made answer that he was not worthy to set his foot
within the King's Chamber, having abus'd his goodness as he had, Schach-Abas comes out of
the Room, and took off the Cymitar from about his Neck, and deliver'd it to him, as an assurance
of his favour. But he strictly forbad him the drinking of any Wine ever after, in as much,
as being got drunk, he knew not what he did. Some time after Emir-Kune-Chan having in a
fight, been wounded in the Arm, and the Physicians having given it as their opinion, that

that abstinence would be prejudicial to his health, the King did not only take off the prohibition
he had made him, but sent him a certain number of Mules loaden with the best Wine in the
Countrey.
               The Persians hate and contemn Cowards,The Persians hate Cowards. and the Officers who neglect their duty in the
Wars are most severely punish'd. An instance hereof was seen in Aliculi-Chan, Governour of
Shorosan, who having let slip the opportunity of engaging Tameras, Prince of Georgia, though
he might have fought him with advantage, Schach-Abas caus'd him to be dress'd in Woman's
Cloaths, and so sent him to the Army, where he was walk'd up and down all day among the Soldiers.
The allowance of a Hors-man is three hundred Crowns per ann. towards the keeping of
himself and his Horse; and that of a Muskettier two hundred. They have the reputation not to
be over-scrupulous in the keeping of their word, as was seen in the Capitulation they granted
the Garrison of Iruan, which was very ill observ'd.
               Those who speak of the Wealth of the King of Persia,The Schach's Revenue. think they speak of a vast and incredible
sum, when they assign him a yearly Revenue of eight Millions of Gold, and imagine they
raise the Reader into admiration, when they affirm that the Province of Candahar alone brings
in yearly near a Million of Gold; that the Cities of Bagdat and Iruan, with the Country thereabouts,
pay in a manner as much, and that it hath been found by the Register's Office of the
Chancery, that the King gets out of the Suburbs of Ispahan, and the Villages within the Baylywick
thereof, near forty thousand Crowns. But those who know, that the Province of Normandy
it self payes yearly such a sum as amounts to almost as much as all the King of Persia's
Revenue, will grant there is no hyperbole in what we have affirm'd. This Revenue was very
much diminish'd in the time of King Tamas, when the Turks and other neighbouring Princes
over-run Persia, so as that they were possess'd of several Provinces belonging to that Crown.
Besides, there is hardly any Bridge or Passage, not only upon the Frontiers, but also all over
the Kingdom, nay, in all Cities almost, but there is somewhat to be paid, without any distinction
of persons, Foreiners or Natives. All Merchandises pay, and the King takes, upon
every Bail of Silk, ten Crowns. There is no Horse sold, but pays xv. d. to the King; an Ox
as much, and an Ass one half, and a Sheep, which are as thick as Ants all over the Countrey,
iij. d. a piece. The King lets out the Caravanseras, which are in Cities, and are appointed for
Lodgings for Foremers and VVare-houses for Merchants, especially at Ispahan, where
there are twenty five of them, of which not any payes less then five thousand Crowns
per ann.
               He Farms out also the Fishing of the Rivers, the Baths, and Stoves, the places of publick
Prostitution, and the Springs of Nefte. He sells also the water which comes into the Fountains,
and raises only from the River of Senderut, at Ispahan, the yearly sum of sixteen thousand
Crowns. All the Armenian Christians, whereof there is a very great number in Persia,
pay yearly a Poll-money, of two Crowns for every head. Nay, what is more, there is not a
person, those only excepted, who are maintain'd by, or have some relation to the King, but
payes a Tax proportionably to what he gets, even to the very Midwife, I say nothing here of
the Presents brought the king from all parts, and which fall by several Chanels into the Prince's
Treasury. The great Lords, though they make good the king's Revenue, yet abate nought of
their own advantages, and find wayes to fleece the Countrey, so as that it is not to be admir'd
there is so little wealth to be found among the people. For there is nothing so true as what a
certain Emperour sometime said, that it is impossible the spleen should be swollen in any
body, and that the other Members of the same body should not be wasted and become
Hectick.
               'Twas also Schach-Abas, who ordered the melting down of seven thousand and two hundred
Marks of Gold for the making of the Pate we have mentioned elsewhere, which his Successors
still produce at the entertainments they make Foreiners, and consists for the most part in
Dishes, Pots, Flaggons, and other Drinking-Cups.
               What we said before of the Military Officers,Officers of the Court. to wit, that they were most of them but meanly
clad, is as true in those Officers who belong to the Court. For there was hardly any one,
who could make ostentation of but ordinary Parentage.
               The Eatemad Dowlet,Chancellor. or Chancellor, who was the President of the king's Council, the Soul
of affairs, the principal Minister of State, and as it were Viceroy of Persia, was the Son of one
who got his livelyhood by writing at Mesanderan, as we have said elsewhere. These Scriveners,
as I may call them, are employ'd only in the Coppying and Transcribing of Books, in regard
they have not as yet, ia this Countrey, the use of Printing, as we have in Europe. He is
called Eahtemad Dowlet, in regard he hath the oversight of the kings Revenues and Treasury.
This was the most self-concern'd person of all that ever had the management of publick affairs,
as a Minister of State. For there was no business done at Court, whereof he made not some
advantage; and there was no charge or employment to be gotten, but the person petitioning
for it must have made his agreement with the Chancellor; whose exactions were, in this particular,
excessive, not only upon the accompt of the Presents, which, being made by him twice

every year to the Court, rendred the king himself in a manner a complice of his concussions,
but also upon this consideration, that being an Eunuch, all the Wealth he got was at his death
to fall to the king.
               The Kurtzi-baschi,Kurtzi-baschi. who had the command of ten thousand Horse, whom Schach-Ismael appointed
as a standing Army, to be constantly maintain'd, named Tzani-Chan, was a Peasant's
Son of Schamlu, who, in the time of Schach-Abas, had been a Menial servant to a Lord of
the Court. These Horse, in time of Peace, retire to their own Habitation, yet are paid as duely
as if they were in actual service, and meet not again till there be an Army on foot, enjoying in
the mean time divers Privileges and Exemptions, which the other later kings of Persia have
granted them.
               The Meheter,Meheter. that is the Lord Chamberlain, or chief Gentleman of the Chamber, named
Schaneser, was a Gcorgian born, of Father and Mother Christians. He had been carried away
in his infancy, and sold to the Court of Persia, where they had made him an Eunuch, so that
he needed not be Circumcis'd to receive the Character of the Persian Religion. He had been a
Page, attending in his Chamber, to Schach-Abas, and was much in favour with Schach-Sefi,
upon this account, that being alwayes near the king's person, in all both Publick and Private
Assemblies, nay, even within the Seraglio, he had the king's Ear, and knew how to comply
with his humour, and make his advantage of the opportunities he had to speak to him, by which
means he obtain'd those favours of him, which another could not have ask'd.
               The Wakenhuis,The Secretary of State. that is, the Secretary of State and of the King's Revenue, who having forty
Clarks under him, perpetually employ'd, issues out all the orders and dispatches which are sent
into the Provinces, and takes an account of all that's receiv'd towards the charge of the King's
house, was called Myrsa Masum. He was a Peasant's Son of the Village of Dermen, in the
Mountain of Elwend, near Caswin, where there are, among others, two Villages, to wit, Dermen
and Saru, whence come the best Pen-men of any in the Kingdom, in regard there's not an
Inhabitant but puts his Children to writing as soon as they are able to hold a Pen, and keep
them so constantly employ'd therein, that even in the fields, and as they keep their flocks, they
pass away their time in that Exercise.
               Aliculi-Chan,Diwanbeki. who had the charge of Diwan-beki, that is, President of the Councel for the
administration of Justice, was the Son of a Christian, of Georgia. He had been taken during the
War which Schach-Abas had in those parts, and sold at Ispahan, where he had serv'd as a Lacquey,
which had also been the condition of his two Brothers, Rustam-Chan, Governour of
Tauris, and Isa-Chan, Iusbaschi, who were made Eunuchs as he was himself. The functions of
his charge consisted principally in presiding at the judgement of Criminal causes, joyntly with
the Seder and the Kasi, and the other Ecclesiastical and Secular Judges, whom they call Schehra,
and Oef, under the Portal of the King's Palace, at the place named Diwan-Chane; and to be
personally present at the Executions of Malefactors.
               The Kularagasi,Kularagas
                   that is, Captain of the Kulam, or Slaves, who are sold to the King, to serve
in the Wars upon any order they receive to that purpose, was called Siausbeki, and had been
one of Schach-Abas's Footmen. Of these Kulams there are about eight thousand, and are permitted
to live at their own Habitations, as the Kurtzi are, and have the same pay; but they
enjoy not the same Privileges or Exemptions, having nothing of that kind which is not common
to them with the king's other Subjects.
               The Eischikagasi-baschi,Eischikagasi-baschi or Lord high Steward, who hath the over-sight of forty Stewards
that serve under him, called Mortusaculi-Chan, was the Son of a heard-man, or one of those
people whom the Persians call Turk, who have no setled Habitation, but remove their Tents
and Huts to those places, where they think to find the best Grass for their Cattel. I said these
Eischikagasi were a kind of Stewards, of whom there are at all times four or five at the Court,
who stand at the door of the king's Appartment, and serve by half-years, under their Baschi,
or Chief, who carries the staff they call Dkenk, and stands before the king when he eats in
publick, on dayes of Ceremonies. He is also one of the two who take Ambassadors under the
Arms, when they are brought to audience. We have already related, how Mortasaculi-Chan
succeeded, in this charge, Vgurlu-Chan, whose head Schach-Sefi had caus'd to be cut
off. Imanculi Sulthan, whom the king of Persia sent upon an Embassy to the Duke of Holstein,
our Master, had the quality of Eischakagasi.
               Schahe Wardi,The Master of the Ceremonies. who was Iesaul Scebet, or Master of the Ceremonies, was the Governour of
Derbent's Son, but his Grand-father was a Peasant, of the Province of Serab. The Iesaul Scebet
carries also a staff, and his principal function consists in placing strangers at the king's Table,
and at publick assemblies.
               The Nasir,The Controller. or Controller of the king's house, whom they also give the quality of Kerek jerak,
because he executes the function of a Purveyer, whose name was Samambek, was the Son
of one of the ordinary Inhabitants of Kaschan.
               The Tuschmal,Tuschmal??? who hath the over-sight of all the Officers belonging to the king's kitchin,

was called Seinel-bek, and was the Son of Seinel-Chan, whom the king kill'd with his own
hands, in the presence of his Mother.
               The Dawatter,Secretary of the Closet. that is, the Secretary of the Closet, whose name was Vgurlu-bek, was the
Son of Emirkune-Chan, He had, in that charge, succeeded Hassan-beg, who was kill'd by the
king's order, because he had been at Supper with Talub-Chan, as we related before The word
Dawatter is deriv'd from Dawat; which signifies an Ink-horn, in as much as the principal function
of this charge consists, in carrying the Ink-horn, and presenting that part thereof where
the Ink is to the king when he is to sign any thing. For the king himself carries the Seal about
his Neck, and Seals or Signs himself, by pressing the Seal upon the Paper, after he had put it
into the Ink.
               Aly-baly-bek,Master of the Horse. who was Myra-chur-baschi, that is chief of the Gentlemen of the Horse,
or Master of the Horse of Persia, was a Senkene by birth, and his Father was a Drover, who
traded altogether in Oxen.
               The Mirischikar,Grand Faulconer. or Grand Faulconer, whose name was Chosrow Sulthan, was a Christian,
an Armenian born, one, notwithstanding his Religion, very much in the king's favour.
               Karachan-bek,Huntsman. who had the charge of Sekbahn-baschi, that is, Overseer of those who kept
the Dogs for Hunting, or chief Hunts-man, as I may call him, was also a Sen-kene, and the son
of a Shepheard.
               The Iesalkor hath two functions,Jesaulkor. to wit, that of Grand-Marshal of the Lodgings, and that
of Judge of the king's houshold. He marches before the king, as well in the Citie as in the
Country, with a staff in his hand, to make way. He hath under him several other Iasauls, who
are as it were Harbingers, and sometimes is employ'd in the securing of persons guilty of Treason,
and such as are imprison'd by the king's express order.
               The other Officers belonging to the Court, are,
               The Suffretzi, that is the Carver.
               The Abdar, who serves the king with water to drink, and keeps it in a Jarr seal'd up, to prevent
any body's putting of poyson into it.
               The Chazinedal, or Overseer of the king's Revenue.
               The Ambadar, who hath the over-sight of the king's Granaries.
               The Iesaul Neder, who keep the king's shooes, when he puts them off in the anti-chamber.
               The Mehemndar, who conducts Ambassadors from one Province to another, till they
come to Court, to their audience there, and so back to the Frontiers.
               Besides these, there are yet several other Officers, not so considerable as the precedent, as,
               The Kischitzi-baschi, Captain of the Guard.
               The Tzabedar, Controller of the Artillery.
               The Tzartzi, who publishes the king's commands.
               The Tzelaudar-baschi, who is as it were a Captain over the Grooms that conduct such Horses
as the king would have led.
               The Kitaddar, Library-keeper.
               The Meamar, Ingeneer and Architect.
               The Mustofi, Purveyer for the House.
               The Seraidar, Surveyer of the buildings.
               The Klita, Captain of the Gate.
               The Scherbedar, Overseer of the Conserves and Spices.
               The Cannati, Confectioner.
               The Omatzdar, Governour of the Pages.
               The Schixtza, Cup-bearer.
               The Eachtzi, who keeps the Gold-plate.
               The Achtzi, Clark of the kitchin.
               The Eemektzi, who bakes the bread which the king himself eats.
               The Forrasch, who makes the fire.
               The Sava, Water-bearer.
               The Bildar, are such as serve for Pioneers, when the king goes any journey, to make the
wayes even, and steps for the safer treading of the Camels. They help also to pitch up Tents,
and dig pits in the ground, whether to get water, or serve for Privies.
               The Schatir, Foot-men.
               The Rica, are men who carry Pole-Axes, and are alwayes about the king's person, as his
Guards; but sometimes they also do the work of common Executioners.
               All these Officers have their Salaries and other Allowances, which are very duely paid them,
not out of the Treasury or Exchequer, but they are charg'd upon the Demesn of certain Villages,
whereof they themselves have the disposal, or they are assign'd them out of some part of
the Taxes, or haply on the Tribute paid by common Prostitutes.
               The Persians seldom meet about affairs, but the Cloath is lay'd. At the two Audiences the
king gave us, as well at our comming thither, as our departure thence, we Din'd with him, and

at all the conferences we had at the Chancellor's, we alwayes found a Collation of Preserves, and
after that the Cloath was lay'd, and the Meat serv'd up.
               When the King eats in publick,The Hakim, Minarzim, and the Seder??? or comes into any assemblies, besides ten or twelve Lords
of the Court, he is ordinarily attended by the Hakim, or Physician, the Seder, and the Minatzim.
The Physician appoints what Mears he should eat of. The Minatzim, or Astrologer,
acquaints him with the fortunate and unfortunate hours, and whatever he sayes is believ'd
as Oraculous: and the Seder, who is the chief of their Ecclesiasticks, explicates to him those
passages of the Alchoran, and such points of their Divinity, where there seems to be any difficulty.
The King and the Kasi joyn together in the naming of the Seder, and they make choice
of him among those, whom they think best skill'd in the explication of the Alchoran, and the
Laws which depend on it. They take his advice not onely in Ecclesiastical, but also in Civil
affairs, but especially in Criminal. He is shew'd the charge and proceedings against the Criminal,
and he returns his advice seal'd with his Seal. The King for the most part follows it, adding
these words, This is the advice of the Seder, which we confirm; then he orders his own
Seal to be set thereto.
               Civil causes are commonly try'd before the Secular Judges whom they call Oef.The administration of Iustice. They are a
kind of Lawyers according to their way, and they have for their chief the Diwan-beki, who
ought to be well vers'd in the Law of Mahomet. Their Pleading dayes are Monday and
Thursday, and the place where they meet for the administration of Justice, is a spacious Arch'd
Hall under the Palace-Gate, where they hear both sides, and if the Causes be of importance,
they report the same to the King, and acquaint him with the opinions of the Judges, whereupon
the King decides them.
               It is forbidden by their Law to put out money to use.Vsury forbidden. Yet they stick not to do it; but if the
Usurers be discovered, they are look'd on as infamous persons, and not admitted into the company
of such as are of any quality, nay, they are also very severely punish'd. Of this we saw
an eample as we pass'd through Ardebil, where they had an odd way to take out a Man's Teeth???
who, by way or interest, had taken one and a half in the hundred for a moneth's time. They
lay'd him all along on the ground, and knock'd out his Teeth one after another with a little
Mallet. They call this kind of Usurers Sudehur, that is, eaters of Interest of Usury, The Persians
are permitted to lay out mony upon Lands, Gardens, and Houses, which they enjoy
while they are out of their money, and if they be not redeem'd within the time agreed upon
between the parties, they are forfeited to the Mortgagee.
               Their punishments are cruel,Their punishments. and proportionable to the irreclaimable obstinacy of that people
who are violently bent to Vice, and laugh at gentle chastisements, and moderate pains. The
least Crimes are punish'd with mutilation of Members. They cut off the Nose, Ears, and sometimes
the Feet and Hands of Malefactors, nay, they are put to death, by cutting off thier
Heads. That defiling, which the Latines call Violatio, is not punish'd with death, but they
think it enough to cut off the part which hath offended, to prove which, there needs onely the
Woman's Oath, if she hath the confidence to reiterate it thrice. The two last Kings, Schach
Abas and Schach-Sefi, have been rather cruel than severe in their punishments, as may be inferr'd
from the examples we have already produc'd thereof, nay, they have been so far such
towards some Criminals, that they have caus'd them to be ty'd between two boards and sawen
asunder. Schach-Abas had sent into Spain one named Teinksbeg, who returning from his Embassy,
and having not brought home all his Retinue, and the King understanding by the Interpreter,
that his ill usage of them had caus'd many of his people to run away, he took the pains
himself to cut off his Nose, his Ears, and a good piece of flesh out of his Arm, and forc'd him
immediately to eat them, bloody and raw as they were. Imanculi-Chan, who was sent Ambassador
to the Duke of Holstein, our Master, treated his Domesticks no better. For a very
trivial fault, he caus'd a Spit red hot to be apply'd to the back of one of his Retinue; and he
order'd another's fingers to be knock'd with the back of an Hatchet, till all the bones were
bruis'd: which oblig'd five or six of his Train to leave his service, and return into Persia by the
way of Italy: for which cruelties he had no doubt been punish'd at his return, had not the
Chancellor made his peace with the King.
               As to the Religion of these people, I could make a long digression, to give some accompt
of that of the antient Persians, and shew how they ador'd the Sun, Moon, Venus, Fire, and
other things, which they made Divinities; but it is besides my design, and therefore I shall
onely say something of that of the modern, and the difference there is, between the Religion
of the Persians and that of the Tuks.
               Both these Nations follow the Doctrine of that grand Impostor Mahomet,The Religion of the Persians. and acknowledge
the same Alcoran; yet do's not that hinder, but they have a mortal animosity one against the
other. And whereas their enmity is chiefly grounded on the difference of their Religions, we
shall here briefly shew wherein it consists.
               Monsieur Busbeque sayes in the third Letter of his Embassy to Turkey, that a man may judge
of the difference of these two Religions, from the conversation he had with a Persian Visir, named

Rustan, who told him, that the Persians had a greater hatred for the Turks, and accounted
them much more profane than the Christians; but he gives no other particular thereof.
Others, who have written of the same subject, as Paulus Iovius, Bizarrus, Minadous, and
a certain English Gentleman, named Thomas Herbert, have given no better an accompt of it;
some, by reason of the little acquaintance they had therewith, and others out of negligence,
having not deliver'd what they might have learn't during the aboad they made in Persia. I have
had the curiosity to make a stricter enquiry into it, and to inform my self as well from such
as I became intimately acquainted withall at Scamachie and Ispahan, by means of the Mathematicks,
as by the reading of some Books, which I have compar'd with what I had learnt thereof
my self.
               The Persians are as free to assume the quality of Mussulman's as the Turks.The Etymology of the word Mussulman. This word is deriv'd
from that of Salama, which comes from another Hebrew word, which signifies, he hath
deliver'd, or saved. And the reason of it is, that the Mahumetane Religion, being to propagate
it self by Arms, and the Alcoram ordering those to be presecuted and kill'd, who refus'd
to pronounce this confession, Ia illah illalahu, Mahumeda resul-alla, that is, There is no other
God but one, and Mahomet the Apostle of God, such as, by this profession, saved themselves
from, or avoided death, were called Mussulmans, that is to say, the saved or delivered. But
the present Turks explicate it otherwise, and affirm, that they who make profession of their
Religion, are Mussulmans, that is, sav'd from eternal damnation. Whence it comes, that
they do not call their Sons Mussulmans, till they are Circumcis'd.
               The Circumcision of the Persians is not celebrated,Circumcision. till the Children are seven, eight, or nine
years of age, and then they intoxicate such as are to be Circumcis'd, with a certain drink, to
make them insensible of the pain they are to endure, in the cutting of the Prepuce; and in this
they agree with the Turks. But the difference between their Religion and that of the Turks,
consists.
               
                  1. In that they explicate not the Alcoran after the same manner.
                  2. That they have not the same Saints.
                  3. That they have not the same Miracles.
                  4. That they have not the same Mosqueyes, nor the same Ceremonies.
               
               The very Principles of their Religions are contrary,The difference between the Religion of the Persians and of the Turks. in as much as Mahomet, having appointed
by his last Will and Testament, that Aly, his Nephew, and Son-in-law, (for he was
the Brother's Son and had Married his Daughter Fattima) should succeed him, as well in Temporals
as Spirituals, Ababeker, Omar, and Osman, all three Father-in-law's of Mahomet,
who were more considerable and powerfull then Aly, and had contributed much to the propagation
and establishment of Mahumet's Religion, usurped, successively one after another, the
Califate, and Political Government of their Son-in-law, notwithstanding the opposition, which
Aly and his friends would have made against it. 'Twas after their death, that Aly obtain'd
the Califate, which yet he was not so possess'd of, but that it was pretended to, and, disputed
against him, by the relations of the three last Califs. Aly did not change any thing in the Alcoran,
and though he gave several Interpretations to the words of Mahomet, and explicated
the sense of his Law, yet did he submit to his Authority, where it was clear, and where the
Text admitted no explication, in so much that this occasion'd no change in the Religion.
               But about the year 1363.The initials of the Religion of the Persians. there happen'd to be at Ardebil, a very learned man, named Sofi,
who pretended himself deriv'd from the Family of Aly, and gave out, that he was, in a right
line, descended from Musai Kasim, the Son of Hossein, who was the Son of Aly. The austerity
of his life, and the outward innocency of his demeanour, manag'd by an understanding
that had the knack of making the most advantageous discoveries it could of it self, brought him
into great reputation, and rais'd him to the quality of Schich. He slighted, at least in appearance,
all the pleasures and enjoyments of this World, clad himself in a Sheep-skin, and would
not wear any thing about him but what was of Wool. Some affirm, that he had the name Sofi
given him, from the word Suff, which signifies Wool, though others are of opinion, and that
with greater probability, that the true Etymology of his name is deriv'd from the word Sefid,
which signifies pale and white, in as much as it is the custom of the Persians, many times, to
give the sirname from the colour of the face, as the Chancellor of Persia, who liv'd at the
time of our Embassy thither, was named Saru Tagge, from the yellowish colour of his countenance.
               Sofi was the first who ventured publickly to teach and write, that the succession of Mahomet,
which belong'd to Aly, his Nephew and Son-in-law, had been illegally usurped from
him and his Posterity, by Abubeker, Omar, and Osman: That God, who had been very
much offended at that procedure, had rais'd him the said Sofi, and had endu'd him with all qualities
necessary for the restauration of the glory of Aly, which had been in a manner buried for
many ages. And to make it appear, that Aly was a man after God's heart, he reviv'd a great

number of Miracles, which he said had been suppress'd by the malice of the Turks: That Aly
had given a true explication of the Alcoran, which his Successor, Tzafersaduck, had reduc'd
into writing, and that in those Commentaries there were many precepts contrary to the opinions
of Hanife, whom the Turks follow, but much more rational. There is not any Nation in the
World more inclin'd to change, and more addicted to Novelty, than the Persians. Sofi's new
Doctrine soon found credit among them, in so much that they forsook that of the Turks, in
whom this Schism heightned the animosity which neighbourhood and perpetual Wars about the
Frontiers had already but too much blown between those two Nations. However, the Persians
made it their business to confirm the reputation of their Aly, and added to their Creed, whereof
we spoke before, these words Aaly welli Alla, so that they said, There is but one God, Mahumet
the Apostle of God and Aly, Coadjutor or Lieutenant of God: Nay, they presume to
affirm, that though Aly be not really God, yet he comes very neer him. And to prefer him
even before Mahomet himself, they add hereto, that it was God's intention to bestow the Alcoran
on Aly, and that it was by mistake it fell into the hands of Mahomet. But as to Abubeker,
Omar, and Osman, they who at Prayer time call the people together (for the Persians, as
well as the Turks, use no Bells) will be sure to Curse these three pretended Prophets, and to
execrate them to the pit of Hell. They have commonly these words in their mouth, Kiri Sekder
deheni Abubeker, Omar, Osman, Hanifebad, that is, many Dogs stones stop the mouths of these
Prophets, which is an abomination to the ears of the Turks, who, upon this accompt are become
irreconcileable Enemies to the Persians, especially since Sedredin and Tzinid, (whom
some name Gutnet) express'd so great a zeal for the establishment and advancement of their
Sect, which is, in process of time, grown so strong, that their Schichs are become Schachs,
that is their Prophets have chang'd their quality into that of Kings.
               The Persians not thinking it enough to have establish'd the Sanctity,The Saints of the Persians. nay, in some measure
the Divinity, of Aly, were of opinion that he had communicated some part of that quality to
those of his Family, and that they might bestow the denomination of Saints upon his first Successors,
of whom there were related many Miracles, whereby their memories have been celebrated,
and their Sepulchres enrich'd by the Presents sent into them. He had lft two Sons,
Hassan, and Hossein, who left Seinel, Abedin, Mahumed-Bagur, Tzafer-Saduk, Musai-Casum,
Risa, Mahumed-Taggi, Alli Naggi, Hossein Alkeri, and Mehedi, whereof some, to
wit, Hassan, Scinel, Abedin, MahumedBagur, MahumedTaggi, and Alli Naggi, are interr'd
at Medina; Tzafer Saduk, at Bagdat, and Hossein, Musai-Kasum, and Hossein Alkeri, at Kelbula
or Kufa. They affirm that Mehedi is not dead, but lies hid in a Cave near Kufa, where he
is to remain till the day of Judgement, which is to be, when his shooes, which he left at the
entrance of it, and which are already turn'd half way, shall be quite turned towards the Cave,
so as that at his coming out he may put his feet into them, to go and convert all the World to
the Faith of the Alcoran.
               On these twelve Saints they bestow the quality of Imam, or Prelate. To these, as also to
the Institutor of their Sect Schich-Sosi, they address their Prayers and Devotions, and it is to
the four Sepulchres of them, that they go on Pilgrimages, especially when their affairs permit
them not to go to Meca, or Medina. They give the Pilgrims a Certificate or Testimonial, called
Sijaretname, whereby they are not only known to be true Mussulmans, professing the true
Persian Religion; but there is also a further particular advantage of these Testimonials, in that
they save their lives, who are in disgrace with the Kings or Governours of the Provinces where
they live. We have seen instances hereof in our Interpreter, whose name was Rustam, who
took one of them, to avoid the punishment which he migh have suffered for embracing the Christian
Religion in England, and another in Tzirrachan, who took this course to save himself, as
we have related elsewhere.
               The Persians Celebrate every year,Their Festivals. with great Ceremonies, the memory and death of Hassan
and Hossein. The Turks deride them for it, and on the contrary, have a great Veneration for
Abubeker, Omar, and Osman, and highly esteem Hanife, their chief Commentator and Paraphrast
of the Alcoran. The Persians execrate the memory of the three former, and speak of
the last as an Impostor, who hath made false explications of the Alcoran. They affirm, that
Hanife, being a servant to Tzafur Saduk, was very carefull to preserve the water, wherein that
Saint had wash'd his hands, which he carried into Turkey, rubb'd therewith the eyes of several
blind people, who by that means recover'd their sight, and wrought divers other Miracles, the
honour whereof belongs only to the Saints of Persia. They add to this, that Schach Tamas,
after the taking of Bagdat, caus'd the body of Hanife, who had a very sumptuous Tomb there,
to be taken up; and that he converted the Masur, or place of his Sepulture, into a Stable, and
the Sepulchre into a Sink or common House of ease.
               There are many Authors have Commented on the Alcoran;Commentators upon the Alcoran. but they who have had a particular
illumination for that work, and have, in their opinion, best understood the Sentiments of
Mahomet, are Aly and Tzafur-Saduk, whom the Persians prefer before all the rest. The
Turks most esteem Hanife; and the Vsbeques Tartars, as also the Indians follow the explication

of Hembili, and Maleki. The Alcoran, in many places, is not to be understood; not
only in that Mahomet himself seems to have affected obscurity, as not knowing himself what
he would say; but also in this regard, that, many times, he alludes to stories which peradventure
never happened, and whereof the Commentators certainly having no knowledge, have
supply'd the defect with their own fictions, fables, and impostures, which have no likelyhood
of truth in them. But not to digress from the Persians, whom it is our particular design here to
give an accompt of, it is a thing much to be admir'd, that these people, who are so ingenious,
and so wise in their Generation, and so excellently well vers'd in the affairs of the World,
could be brought to believe things so ridiculous, and the many fables, their Books of Devotion
are fill'd with. As for instance, among others, that Duldul, (so they call Aly's Horse)
was got of a Rock. That it was the Angel Gabriel who brought him the Sword, called Dzulfakar,
wherewith he did so many great exploits: That with the said Sword, he kill'd a Dragon
that had seven heads; and cut a Devil to pieces. And that Sulthan Mahomet Chodabende,
being one day a-hunting neer Kufa, discover'd thereabouts a Sepulchre with this Inscription,
Vnder this place ly Adam, Noe, and Aly, and that thereupon the Sulthan had ordered the building
of the Citie of Netzef, where he had erected a Tomb in memory of Aly. But there is
not any thing so ridiculously flat as the story they relate of Aly's drinking with the Angels in Paradise.
               And that there may be no scruple made of the supernatural,Miracles. and as it were Divine power, attributed
by them to the Author of their Sect, they relate a great number of Miracles wrought
by him, which Miracles indeed are chargeable with some imposture among those of other perswasions,
but in the Religion of the Persians, they are the more impertinent, in that they make
their Saints do them, without any necessity. As for instance, when they affirm, that Schich
Sofi, being yet very young, and going to see Schich Sahadi, who was a great Saint, and a very
wise man, and liv'd in the Village of Sahedan, in the Province of Kilan, he there took particular
notice of the pains the Inhabitants were at in weeding their Grounds, and moved to compassion
thereat, he commanded the Weeds not to pester the Earth any longer. He was immediately
obey'd. But Schich Sahadi observing it, said to him; I see, Son, what thou art able
to do; but thou art to consider, that if thou ease these Pesants of the employment wherein they
spend their time, they will be lost through idleness. Schich-Sofi thought this so excellent a consideration,
that he presently resolv'd to serve that holy man, with whom he continu'd seven
years, and learnt of Sahadi many noble things. It is upon this accompt, as they affirm, that
the said Village, to this day enjoyes an absolute and perpetual privilege and exemption.
               They relate also that Tamberlane, whom they call Temurleng, desirous to see Schich-Sofi, and
to be assur'd whether his Sanctity was answerable to the great reputation he had acquir'd all over
the East, resolv'd to give him a Visit, and to have an evident Demonstration of the truth of his
Doctrine, he bethought himself to make a tryal of it, with a resolution to rest satisfy'd as to
his Sanctity, if he behav'd himself in three things as he expected he should; to wit, 1. if he
came not out to meet him: 2. If he entertain'd him with Rice, boyl'd, not in Sheep's Milk,
but that of wild Goats: and 3. If the poyson he would order to be given him, should not kill
him. Hereupon Tamberlane being come to Schamasbu, where Sofi then liv'd, went streight to
his Chamber, Sofi saw him well enough coming, but would not go to meet him, till Tamberlane
had set foot within his Chamber: then Sofi rose up, and said to him, I know well enough what
respect is due to the King, but it was your pleasure I should not meet you. I humbly crave your
pardon. 'Tis a tryal you were pleas'd to make of me. This Complement pass'd, he made
Tamberlane sit down, opposite to the Door, and caus'd to come of the neighbouring Forrest a
great many wild Goats, which were milked in Tamberlane's presence. At last Sofi perceiving
they were going to give him poyson; call'd for a clean shirt, which he put on, and having drunk
the poyson, he fell a dancing round the Room, according to the manner of the Schichs, and
continu'd that exercise so long, till such time as having put himself into a sweat all over the body,
he took off the shirt, out of which he wrung the sweat, which the poyson had made of a
Green colour, and having put it into a Glass, presented it to Tamberlane, to satisfie him that it
had done him no harm. That thereupon Tamberlane made no further doubt of the truth of Sofi's
Doctrine; that he bestow'd on him several Villages near Ardbil, and made him a Present
of a great number of Turks, whom he was to instruct in his Religion.
               The Turks believe not a word of all these Miracles; but however, they have a great Veneration
for the memory of Aly. They acknowledge he was a near Kinsman of Mohomet's, that
he is truly an Iman, or Saint, and that he led a very exemplary life; and particularly that he
was valiant, and a very good Horsman; and thence it comes, that, when they get on Hors-back,
they say Isa Aly, in the name of Aly.
               As the Persians will not admit of any of the Laws and Ordinances which Abubekar,Their purifitions. Omar,
Osman, and Hanife, affirm to be grounded on the Alcoran, so they also contemn all the Ecclesiastical
Ceremonies of the Turks, and have particular ones of their own, which they believe to
be as necessary, as any thing that is most essential in the business of Religion. For instance,

when the Persians intend to do their Devotions, especially their Prayers, they prepare themselves
by external ablution as the Turks do, but after an absolutely different manner. They
turn up their sleeves above the Elbow, wash their hands, which they afterwards put, two several
times upon the Arms, stroaking them from the Elbow down to the Wrist. Then they stroak
their faces only with the right hand. The Turks, on the contrary, take up so much water as
they can hold between their hands, and therewith rub their faces, stroaking them three several
times, from the Forehead down to the Chin, and afterwards from the Chin up to the Forehead.
They wash also their Noses and Mouths, by drawing in with their breath the water, which, to
that end, they take up between their hands. The Persians stroak their Heads with a moist
hand, from the Nape of the Neck to the Forehead, and afterwards the Feet up to the Ancles.
But the Turks pour water on their Heads, and so apply their moist Hand to the Feet, which they
are oblig'd to wash, before they begin these Ceremonies: but this the Persians do not. The
Turks put the fore-finger into the Ear, which they afterwards rub all about with the Thumb,
and then with the same fore-finger stroke their Heads from the Nape of the Neck, to the
Throat. These Ceremonies are perform'd in their Houses, before they go out in order to the
doing of their Devotions, in the Mosquey; whither the Women come not at all, out of a fear
they might distract the Devotions of the men. The Persians have a stone, wherewith they often
touch their forehead, while they are at their Prayers; or haply they lay the stone upon the
ground, and touch it with their foreheads. It is made of a greyish Earth, which is to be had
about Metzef and Kufa, where Hossein was kill'd, and interr'd, near Aly, and thence it is that
the said stone derives all its vertue. The Figure of it is Octogonal, and it is somewhat above
three inches Diameter, and contains, with the names of their twelve Saints, that of Fattima,
their common Mother. They are made by the Arabians, who bring them into Persia to be
sold.
               The Persians being come to the Mosquey begin their Prayers with Alla Ekber.Their Prayers. When they
Pray, their Arms hang down negligently, and they have their eyes fasten'd on the ground. On
the contrary, the Turks have both their hands upon their Breasts. The Persians, afterwards,
put their hands upon their Ears, and turn their faces to the South, out of this regard, that Meca
and Medina are towards that Quarter, in respect of the Citie of Ardebil, where their Sect
had its first Institution and Original. There is some probability, that, in this particular, they
would imitate the primitive Christians, who, in their Prayers, turn'd their faces towards the
East, to express, that Christ, their Sun of Righteousness, was risen. Whence it came that the
Christians being charg'd in the time of Severus the Emperour, as if they ador'd the Sun, Tertullian
vindicates them in his Apology, and gives an accompt of the true cause of that Ceremony.
               The Persians having thus turn'd their faces towards the South, begin their Prayers with that
of Allhemdo lilla. Having said that, they set their Hands on their Knees, and in that stooping
posture they say the Prayer Subhanna Rebbi, and repeat the Alla Ekber. Then they kneel down,
touch their foreheads with the grey stone, and repeat the foresaid Prayer of Subhanna Rebbi,
stretching out their Arms. After all this, they make the last Prayer upon their Knees, then rise
up, and turning to the left and right hand, they pronounce with a low voice, Salom alekom,
Salom alekom, saluting the Angels who have assisted them, and kept the Devil from disturbing
them in their Devotions, The Turks salute the Angels before they have quite made an end of
their Prayers. The Religion of the Persians obliges them to say their Prayers five times a day,
to wit, in the morning at Sun-rising, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, and as they go
to bed. Their chief Prayer is the Fatah, and next to that, the Allhemdo lilla, which Translated
is to this effect. Glory be to the Lord of all Creatures, to the King of the last judgement. We honour
thee; we invoke thee; assist us in our necessities; Lead us in thy wayes; bring us into the path
of those to whom thou hast done good, and not into the way of those, upon whom thou hast poured out
thy wrath, nor into that of such as thou suffrest to go astray. Amen.
               And whereas all the Chapters of the Alcoran begin with these words,They are very devou. bismilla rahman rahim,
in the name of God, &c. the Persians accordingly never undertake any thing, but they pronounce
the bismilla, and sometimes say, benahm ohnki namesch heres tzanehaft, that is, in his
name, who is the refuge and protection of Souls, they express a great attention and devotion in
their Prayers; insomuch that going sometimes into the great Metschid Mehedi, at Ispahan,
at the time when they were at Prayers, I could never observe, that they so much as took notice
of me; but they had their eyes either fastened on the ground, or lifted them up to Heaven,
according to the subject of their Prayers. There are some among them, who pray with such violence
at their own houses, that they put themselves out of breath, and many times fall down in
a swound. I remember to this effect a story of one of my Neighbours at Scamachie, who was
so earnest in his Devotion, that having said his Prayer very loud, and pronounc'd with all his
might, above fifty times the word Hakka, which signifies, God, he at length could not pronounce
it without a great deal of difficulty, and at last his voice quite fail'd him. There are
some, who, at their Prayers use a certain kind of Beads, which they call Moher Thebish, consisting
of three dozen, distinguish'd by so many great Beads.
               
                  
Upon Friday, which is their ordinary Festival, their Chaltib, or Preacher, gets up into
the Pulpit, and reads certain Chapters of the Alcoran, with the explication thereof. They
make no account at all of our Bible, and say it hath been falsify'd by the Iews and Greeks, and
that for that reason God sent the Alcoran, as a Corrected Bible, or the true word of God.
While I was at Scamachie, I shew'd the Minatzim Chalil, the Pentateuck in Arabick. He
knew the book well enough, but said of it, Chrabdur, that is, it is a book that's corrupt and
abolish'd; the Alcoran is much the better.
               They have very strange and extravagant opinions concerning the Creation of the World,Their opinion concerning Heaven and Hell.
the first man, the stories of the Bible, the last judgement and eternal life. They affirm, among
other things, that, at the beginning, God made seven Hells, & as many Paradises, but
that to the foresaid number there was an eighth Paradise added, upon the following occasion.
Ath, King of Persia, and Grand-father of Nimroth, one of the most powerfull Princes of his
time, grew so vain-glorious and proud, that he would be respected as a God: and to the end
there should not any thing of Magnificence be wanting, he lay'd out several Millions of Gold,
in building the noblest and most Sumptuous Palace, that the Wit and Art of man could imagine,
which was to serve him for a Paradise. But the King being upon his way to go and see it, and
take possession thereof, there rose up such a thick Mist, which so cover'd the House and Gardens
that were about it, that it seemed to have quite vanish'd, so that it could never yet be
found: and that this is the eighth Paradise, which God hath joyned to the other seven.
               The Persians have also the custom of dedicating or devoting their Children to some Saint,They dedicate their Children to Saints. as
soon as they come out of the Mother's Womb, to which Saint they are to be as it were Slaves
as long as they live. As a badge of this slavery, they make a hole in their Ears, as soon as
they are born, and thence it is they have the name of Mahumedculi, Imanculi, Aaliculi,
that is, the Slaves of Mahomet, Iman, and Aaly. This they ordinarily do, when they are
some years married before they have Children, or when the Children thrive not well. There are
also some who devote them to a Monastical life, and promise to make them Abdallas. And
yet if the Children that have been so design'd express no inclination to a Monastical life, they
may go to some holy place, and for a sum of money be dispens'd of their Father's vow.
               They have also a Lent or Fast,Their Lent. which lasts a moneth every year. They call it Rusch, or,
with the Turks Orutz, and they begin and end it, according to the prescription of the Alcoran,
with the Moon??? of the moneth Ramesan. They observe it with somewhat more austerity than
the ordinary Fasts, in as much as they neither eat nor drink between Sun-rising and Sun-set:
but they have all the night to do what they please in, and they commonly spend it so well, that
they never fast less than they do at that time. For having sufficiently furnish'd themselves with
Meat and Wine in the night, they ly down in the morning, and sleep away part of the day.
Such as are unwilling to fast, may, for money, get a dispensation.
               There is in Persia a sort of people whom they call Seid,The Kinred of Mahomet. and they are of the Posterity of Mahomet
and Aly, and enjoy several particular Privileges and Exemptions. They do not shave
their heads as the other Persians do, but onely cut their hair about the breadth of two fingers,
and let the rest grow, which they tie up together in a tress. They are not permitted to marry
out of their own Family, in regard the Alliances they might make elsewhere would much diminish
the King's Revenue. They are clad in white, and their shooes are low and flat-soal'd.
They are forbidden not onely the drinking of Wine, but also being in the place where any is
Drunk; so that if they are invited to any entertainment, the other Guests must be content with
Duschab, or onely water. The touching of a Dog renders them unclean. One untruth would
forfeit all their Privileges; and whereas all the other Persians swear by the name of God, Aly,
Schich-Sofi, and by the Beyamber ba embia, that is, by the Posterity of Aaly, these Seid have
no other Oath than that of Eulademen, that is, by my birth. Those of them who live in Cities
are commonly rich, in regard they are possess'd of Lands and Villages, for which they pay
not the King any thing, whence it comes they are sufficiently proud and insupportable. There
are some who assume the quality of Seid, though they go from Citie to Citie, and live by
Alms. They shew their Testimonials where they come, but they are for the most part Counterfeit,
and such as make use of them are accounted Impostors; and thence it is they call them
Cher-Seid, that is, Saints-Asses. Some of these last mentioned carry, about them, some hair,
in round boxes of silver, which they say was taken off Mahomet's head, and have the sleight
to make the several hairs come streight out at a little hole, perswading the simple, that that is
done by some supernatural and miraculous vertue. This hair they fell at a very dear rate, and
the Persians make use of it in their Devotions, putting it upon their books, when they say
their Prayers.
               At Kimas, in the Province of Kilan, there was one of these Mountebanks, who having
found out the trick of setting Cotton on fire by means of a Chrystal cut half round, and held in
the Sun like a burning-glass, would have people perswaded by that Operation, which he affirm'd
to be Supernatural, that he was of the Kindred of Mahomet. After our return to Holstein,
I shew'd the Persians, whom Schach-Sefi sent thither, that it was the easiest thing in the

World to get fire from the Sun, and I lighted paper in the very depth of Winter, by means
of a Chrystall full of cold Water, or a piece of Ice, which I had made half round in a Pewter
Dish. They were astonish'd at it, and said, that if I had done as much in Persia, I should have
pass'd there for either a great Saint, or a Sorcerer.
               There is yet another sort of Ecclesiasticks in Persia,Another sort of Religious men. who are thought to be descended from
Aly, instead whereof the Turks have the Dervis, of whom the Kulesthan makes many pleasant
stories. These are called Abdalla's, and are a kind of Monks or Friers. They are very meanly
clad, with a kind of sleeve-less Coat, of several pieces, quilted like Mattresses. Some of
them wear onely a hairy skin, having at the waste, instead of a Girdle, a Serpent of brass,
given them by their Doctors, when they make their profession, as a mark of their Learning. It
is the Suffibaschi, or chief of the Suffi who Consecrates them in the Sufficane, at Ardebil, Ispahan,
and Meschet. These Abdallas trudge up and down the Markets and other publick places,
to assemble the people, and Preach to them the Miracles of their Saints, and to curse
Abubeker, Omar, Osman, and Hanife, as also the Saints of the Vsbeques Tartars, of whom
they relate ridiculous and obscene stories, to make them abominable and despicable. This Contributes
somewhat to the establishment of their Religion, and heightens in the Children the
hatred they have against the Turks, for those are the chief Auditors of these Market-Lectures;
and thence it comes, that these Abdallas are never seen neer the Frontiers of Turkey. There
are some of them, who take whatever their Auditors give them, and thence it comes they are
also termed Kalanderan; for after they have spent about half an hour in talking and telling of
stories, much after the manner of our Mountebanks, they have some small money given them,
whereupon they dismiss the assembly, to go and Preach in some other place. They have in
their hand a Hatchet or Scepter of wood, wherewith they make their Gestures, and handle
them, as those in our parts, who shew tricks of Legerdemain, do their sticks. They set out
their Discourse with all sorts of Fables, and sometimes bring in such palpable lies, that some
make no difficulty to interrupt them, and reproach them with their impudence. They are a
lewd sort of people, addicted to all manner of vices. Tipling-houses and places of publick prostitution
are their ordinary retreats, and they are for the most part Buggerers and High-way-men.
That they may commit their Robberies with greater safety, they go in the night time into
Caves, and, Counterfeiting the neighing of Horses, they make a discovery of what number
passes by. Hence it comes, that there are few that will give them so much as Lodging, in so
much that they are forc'd to take up their quarters in Chapels, built for that purpose neer the
Mosqueyes.
               I shall here relate, to this purpose, what happen'd, at the time of our Embassy, in the Village
of Lekere, within three leagues of Ardebil, to one of these Abdallas, who address'd himself
to a young Woman, desiring her to give him a night's Lodging. The Woman excus'd her
self upon the absence of her Husband, and told him, that, another time when her Husband
were at home, he should not be deny'd. The Abdalla finding the young Woman to his mind,
and seeing her go out to milk the Kine, made his advantage of the opportunity, crept into the
house, and hid himself under a bed, which the Persians, in the Summer time, put on high
Tressels, as well to prevent the inconvenience they receive from insects, as that they may make
use of the floor to put their Corn upon. The VVoman being return'd from milking, desir'd a
young Maid of the neighbourhood to keep her company that night, and while they were at Supper,
she intreated the Maid, to reach some Cakes she had lay'd upon the bed; which she did,
but finding the Abdalla lying under it, and imagining it was with the VVomans consent and
privity that he was come thither, she would stay no longer with her. The Abdalla perceiving
the Maid was gone, comes out, salutes the young VVoman, and desires her to Lodge him, and
having obtain'd that, made it his further intreaty, that she would afford him part of her own
bed. The poor Woman finding her self alone, made as if she consented, and told him, she
would onely go into the next Room to get somewhat for his Supper: but as soon as she was got
in, she lock'd the Door, and barricado'd her self in with certain Bags of Rice. The Abdalla
finding himself chows'd, lay'd hold of a little Child, and threatned the VVoman to kill it, if
she would not open the Door. The VVoman made answer, that her honour was dearer to her
than her Child, and that her Husband, who would be the most injur'd in its miscarriage, would
get more of them. Upon that the Abdalla kill'd the Child with a broad Knife, which these
Villains are wont to carry at their Girdles, and call Bukdan, cut him into four quarters, and
beset himself to force open the Door. To get into the Room, he made a hole under the Threshold
of the Door, and thrust himself into it to get through; but ere he had quite pass'd his
head and shoulders, the VVoman cries out; and finding a Plough-share in the Room, gave him
so many strokes over the head and neck therewith, that he dy'd of it. The Neighbours, coming
in at the noise, and, immediately after the Husband, found this sad Spectacle of the Abdalla,
and, having got open the Door, the VVoman swounded in the Room. Being come to her self,
she call'd to mind, that the Rogue, finding himself hurt by the first blow she had given him,
had begg'd his life, and told her that he had wherewithall to purchase it: whereupon the Husband

took the pains to search him, and to examine his ragged Coat, which had so many pieces
about it, as made a shift to Lodge eight hundred Chequines, whereof the Peasant made his advantage.
The Abdalla's body was burnt.
               The Persians interr their Dead,Their Interrments. within three hours after the Soul is gone out of the body,
unless it be in the night time. They wash the bodies before they are interr'd, and this Ceremony
is perform'd, in the house, to persons of quality, or in a place built in the Church-yard
for that purpose, which they call Mordeschar Cane, for the common people. I had the opportunity
to see these Ceremonies at Caswin, in our return from Ispahan. 'Twas the body of a
young man of about twenty years of age, whom they carried in his Cloaths, and before he
was quite cold, singing all along, to the Church-yard, where they stripp'd him, and cast him
into a Cestern built about with Free-stone, about sixteen foot square. The Grave-maker having
wash'd the body all over, they put a clean shirt about him, wrapp'd him in a shrowd of
Cotton Cloath, and lay'd him on a Ber, to be carry'd to the Grave, which was not far thence.
Persons of quality have this further Ceremony done them, that at their coming out of the Bath,
the body is set upright, and they pour Camphir water, which they call Kafur, upon the head,
whence it runs down all over the body, all the Overtures whereof are stopped with Cotton.
Then they lay it near the Grave, and the Priest having read some passages of the Alcoran, raises
up his head a little, which he presently lets down again, and then he is put into the Grave
without any Coffin. The Graves are made very hollow, and some are vaulted, and others cover'd
with boards??? the body is laid down on the right-side, with the face towards the West,
upon this accompt, that the Persians, among other things, are of a perswasion, that at the last
Judgement, the Sun and Moon shall be very sad, and that the Sun coming to the West shall
stand still, and that both those Planets shall become as black as Coal. That then the Angel
Gabriel shall come and beat the Sun and Moon, and force them to return from the West to the
East, and that the last judgement shall begin at the West. Then the Priest, having taken up a
little earth in his hand, read another passage of the Alcoran, went seven paces from the Grave,
then return'd to it again, and having read another passage, retir'd with all the company. After
these Ceremonies, persons of quality are wont to make a Feast, the third day after the interrment,
but without any Wine, and if the deceas'd hath left much Wealth behind him, they
make another Feast on the seventh, and another on the fortieth day, as also at the Naurus, at
the Kurban, and at the Ramesan, being sure to distribute some Almes among the Poor.
               The reason why they make the Graves so hollow, and stop up all the Overtures of the body,
is, the belief they are of, that when the Priest goes seven paces from the Grave, two Angels,
named Nekir and Munkir, come into it, and, if the Overtures were not stopped, might
be incommodated by some uncleanness. They believe, that, during that time, the Soul returns
into the body, that she raises it into a sitting posture, that it may give the Angels an account
of all its Members had done in this World. Then he makes these questions to the deceas'd;
In whom hast thou believ'd? whereto it answers, In one onely God, my Heavenly Father.
Who is thy Prophet? Mahomet. Who is thy Iman? Aaly. If he answers pertinently to
the questions, and can give any account of the use of his Members, there is no doubt made but
he is sav'd, and that the Angels thereupon seize the soul, and absolutely separate it from the body.
There are only persons of age who are subject to this examination; Children being not
oblig'd to give any account of their Faith.
               The Persians, to shew that Abathalib, Aly's Father, is infallibly sav'd, affirm that he was,
before, named Emiram, and that he dy'd before Mahomet. Being buried, and the Angels having
ask'd him who was his Prophet, he made answer, it was Mahomet; but when they ask'd
him who was his Saint, he was at a loss, and knew not what to say, for he knew not then that
his Son Aly should become so great an Imam. Whereupon the Angel Gabriel going to Mahomet,
bid him send Aly to Abalhalib's Sepulchre, and to say to him, Father I am thy Imam,
and shall draw thee to me at the day of Judgement: and that thence it comes, they gave Emiram
the name of Abathalib, that is, the seeking Father, in as much as the Father had sought,
and found his Imam.
               The interrments of great Lords and persons of quality are performed with great Pomp, and
the body is accompany'd by a great procession. We made mention, in the fift book of this Relation,
of a Gentleman of Scamachie who had drunk so much Aquavitae, that he dy'd of it the
next day. The Ceremonies of his interrment were as followeth.
               In the first place, in the head of the Procession, there marched six men carrying Banners, and
great and long Poles, much like those we had seen at our entrance into that place, with this
difference only, that those at this Funeral were wreath'd. Next marched four Horses, the first
whereof carried the Bow and Arrows of the deceas'd, and the other three some part of his
Cloaths. After these, one of his Menial servants, mounted on an excellent Mule, carry'd his
Mendil, or Turbant. This man was follow'd by two men, carrying on their heads, certain
Towers, which they call Nachal, adorn'd with great Plumes of Feathers, who danc'd and
leap'd to the sound of the Musick, which came after them, and consisted of Tabours, and Copper

basins, which they struck one against another. Between this Musick and the Dancers, there
were carried eight Dishes of Preserves, having each of them a Sugar-Cake in the midst, cover'd
with blue paper, which is the colour of their Mourning, and about every Cake three Wax-Candles
lighted. Next marched divers of the Suffi, who were distinguish'd from others by their
white Turbants. Then follow'd two bands of Musicians, who with all their might sung the
la illa illaha, and the Alla Ekber, accompanying their cries with such distorted Countenances
and Postures, as Scaramuzza himself would be much troubled to imitate. Then follow'd three
young Boyes, having their right shoulder and arm naked, and their foreheads and arms so
scratch'd, that the blood trickled down to the ground. Lastly, there follow'd three men, carrying
each of them a Tree, whereto they had fasten'd certain red Apples, and the Tresses of hair,
which the said Gentlemans three Wives had either pluck'd or cut off their heads, as also certain
pieces of red and green paper. These went immediately before the body, which was carried by
eight men upon their shoulders; and upon the Bier there was a very fair Garment, lined with
the precious skins of the Buchar-sheep. Behind the Corps there follow'd four men, carrying, in
a very high Chair, a young Lad, who read certain passages of the Alcoran, and the Procession
was clos'd with the Relations and Friends of the deceas'd, who went along with the body to a
certain place of the Citie, where it was to remain, till such time as it should be transferr'd to
Bagdat, to be dispos'd near their Imams.
            
            
               
               THE
TRAVELS
OF THE
AMBASSADORS
FROM THE
DUKE of HOLSTEIN
INTO
MUSCOVY, TARTARY,
and PERSIA.
               The Seventh Book.
               HAving given an account, in the precedent Book, of all we thought worthy our
observation in the City of Ispahan, during the abode we made there, as also
of all we could learn of the State of the Kingdome of Persia, and the Inhabitants
thereof, and their manner of life, at least as far as was consistent with
the relation of our Travells; it shall be our business in the subsequent to set
down the particulars of our return, and to reconduct the Ambassadors into
their Countrey.
               All things being set in order for our departure,Some of the Retinue take Sanctuary. there hapned a difficulty which occasioned
no small distraction. The King of Persia had commanded AbasculiChan, our Mehemander, to
conduct us, in our return, through the Province of KILAN, out of this consideration, that
the said Province being one of the best and most fertile of all the Kingdome, it was his pleasure
we should pass through it; as well that we might be eye-witnesses of the riches of it, and give
an account thereof in Germany, as that we might find there those conveniences, which we had
not met withall in our coming thither, and which we should hardly light upon elsewhere. But
in regard the Inhabitants of Kilan are cruel and barbarous, whereas all the other Persians are
civil and obliging, it rais'd an apprehension in some, that the King had given those orders purposely
to ruine us, and it was reported, that his Majesty, being incens'd against the Ambassador
Brugman, who in several Occurrences had demean'd himself insolently and imprudently,
intended to make those people the instruments of his revenge upon him, and all of us. And this
it had been the more easie for him to do, in that he needed only to awaken the resentments of
the Governours of Derbent and Scamachie, whom the Ambassador Brugman had indiscreetly
affronted at our first passage that way. Most of our people were so prepossess'd with this apprehension,
and had given so much credit to the report, which was spread up and down the Citie,
to that effect, that five of our Retinue went and took up their Quarters with Lyon Bernoldi,
in the Alla-Capi, or Sanctuary, to wit, the Captain of our ship, Michel Cordes, his Mate, one
of the Pages, the Chirurgeon, who afterwards went along with Mandello into the Indies, and
one of the Guard.
               
                  
We left Ispahan, on the 21. of December, towards the evening. Most of the English
Merchants accompany'd us above a League out of the Citie, to a certain place, where they
gave us a Collation,DECEM. at the foot of a pleasant green Hill; which done, they took leave of us,
and return'd to the Citie.The Ambassadors leave Ispahan. The same night, we travell'd three Leagues, to a Village named
Reschman, where we continn'd all the next day, as well for some reasons, not fit to be discover'd
as in expectation of the Poslanick, or Muscovian Envoy, who was to take the same
way, and accompany us. The Augustine Fathers of Ispahan and F. Ambrose, Prior of Tistis,
came thither also, to take their leave of us, and afterwards, Monsieur Malon, the most
considerable person among the French Merchants, came also to make us his Complements.
Monsieur Mandelflo came also to the said place, as well to take his final leave of us, as to acquaint
us, that the King of Persia had appointed Imanculi Sulthan, Eischickagasi, or one of
his Stewards, for the Embassy he intended to send to his Highness the Duke of Holstein, our
Master; that he carried along with him a Present amounting to five and twenty thousand
Crowns, and that he was taking his leave, in order to his departure from the Court, within
a few dayes after.
               The 23. after we had taken leave of our friends, not without the shedding of some tears, we
got on hori-back, and reach'd that day to the Caravansera of Dombi, five leagues from our
former lodging.
               The next day, we got five leagues further, and took up our lodging at night in a Caravansera,
called Serdehe.
               The 25. being Christmas-day, we saw, neer the Village of Kaskabath, within two leagues
of Serdehe, how the King was encamped there under several Tents, which being of divers
colours, made a very delightfull show. The Ambassadors sent thither the Sieur Francis Murrher,
who understood the Turkish language. He made the King so handsom and respectfull a
Complement,Come to Natens. that his Majesty openly express'd how much he was satisfy'd therewith. In the
mean time we pass'd on, and went and lodg' in the little Citie of Natens.
               The 26. we travell'd on, and took up our Quarters at night in a Caravansera, named
Chotzakassim.
               The 27. we came to the Citie of Kaschan,Kaschan??? where the difference which happen'd between
the Ambassador Brugman and our Mehemander, put us to much trouble. For the Mehemander,
thinking it a disparagement to him to be domineer'd over by the Ambassador, would have return'd
to the Court, to make his complaints of the ill treatment he receiv'd from us; and had
done it, had it not been for the Ambassador Crusius, who reconcil'd them, but it was his business
for four dayes, which we spent to no other purpose at Kaschan. We found the weather
there very fair, and hot enough, though it were in the very depth of Winter.
               
                  M.DC.XXXVIII.
                  IANVARY the first,JANUA. we Celebrated the beginning of our New year by the firing of
our great Guns, which were discharg'd three times, and afterwards by a Sermon and the ordinary
Prayers. In the after-noon, we got on hors-back, and reach'd that day five leagues,
to the Village of Sensen.
                  The 2. we got five leagues further, and took up our Quarters at night, at Kasmabath.
                  The third, we came to the Citie of Kom,Kom??? where we were assign'd lodgings, in very fair
houses neer the Basar, upon the complaints we made of the losses we had receiv'd in our former
passage that way, when we were quarter'd in certain old ruin'd houses, where we had many
things stollen from us.
                  We continu'd there all the 4th. and the Mehemander, to show he had forgotten all former
differences, treated us so well that day, that we had all the reason in the World to be assur'd
thereof. The Muscovian Ambassador, who seem'd willing to have a little debauche, oblig'd
us to pass away the night with him.
                  Ian. 5. we travell'd five leagues, to a Caravansera, named Schaferabath. But ere we were all
got out of the Citie of Kom, we found the Sun eclips'd soon after his rising. It was not quite
three degrees above the Horizon, when the Moon depriv'd us almost of all sight of it, and so
overshadow'd it, that, to my judgement, in the greatest obscurity, the eclipse was three parts
of four.
                  Neer this Caravansera,The Mountain of Kilissim. and on our right hand, we discover'd the Mountain of Kilissim, which
is not very high, but encompass'd of all sides with several barren and stony Hills, which produce
nothing but Salt, as do's also all the neighbouring Champaign, which is all white, by
reason of the Salt and Saltpeter. This Mountain, as also, those of Nachtzuan, Kulb, Vrumi,
Kemre, Hemedan, Bistan, and Suldus, supply all Persia with Salt, which is digg'd out of
them as out of a Quarry. The Persians speaking of the Mountain of Kilissim, have this expression,
Kim keder kelmes, that is, those who go it up come not down; an equivocation
wherein many of our people have been mistaken, in so much that they have set down in their

Journals,1638. that the said Mountain is so dangerous, that such as go up it, never come down
again. Whereas the true meaning of those words is onely this, that they who go up that Mountain,
come not down, that is, that as long as they are getting up they do not come down,
in as much as both cannot be done at the same time. The Persians affirm indeed, that Schach-Abas
one day commanded one of his Hunts-men to go up to the top of it, and that he did so,
and made it appear by the fire he made there, and that he never return'd thence, and that it
could never be known what became of him: but this is onely a made story.
                  The sixth,Brugman hurt. we continu'd our journey, but ere we were well got out of our Quarters, the
Ambassador Brugman's horse fell down under him, in a very plain way. He had not onely the
right Arm put out of joynt by the fall, but his brains were also so disorder'd, that we thought
he would hardly ever be his own man again. But indeed we had all a sad day's journey of it, in
regard most of our horses tir'd, nay, mine falling down dead under me, I was forc'd to make
use of my man's, who went afoot, and carried the Portmantle upon his head. We lodg'd that
night,Come to Saba. at Saba, where we stay'd all the next day, to give the Ambassador Brugman some rest,
to recover his senses.
                  The 8. we left Saba betimes in the morning, and travell'd that day nine leagues, to a Caravansera
named Choskera. In our way, we lost one of the Mules, which being stray'd some distance
from the rest, had been driven out of the way by some Peasants. They were pursu'd to
the next Village, where the Mule was found, with some part of its burthen, in a house, among
a great many Women, who had made a shift to unload the beast, but finding themselves
surpriz'd, and fallen into the hands of strangers, they cry'd out as if they had been undone.
The Thieves were got away, so that all could be done, was to bring away the Mule with what
was left.
                  As soon as we were lodg'd in this Caravansera, the Ambassador Crusius gave order for the
seizing of certain Sea-men who had committed several insolences at Saba; but they put themselves
in a posture of defence, and endeavour'd to make an insurrection in the Retinue, in so
much that we were oblig'd to disarm them by force, and to put them into Irons, wherein they
continu'd till our coming to Scamachie. In all this quarter, and till we came to the Mountain
of Kilan, the weather was cold enough, and the Snow upon the ground was above half a foot
deep.
                  Ian. 9.Meet with an Ambassador from the King of Poland. having travell'd about three leagues, neer an old uncover'd Caravansera, named Hetzib,
we met with a Lord whom the King of Poland sent Ambassador to the King of Persia. His
name was Theophilus de Schonberg, a person, though well advanc'd in years, of a very good
countenance. He was a German by extraction, and yet in the discourse that pass'd between him
and the Ambassadors, which lasted above an hour, he spoke altogether in Latine: but taking
leave of us, he discover'd himself to be a German. He told us, among other things, that the
King his Master had given him a Retinue of 200. persons, but that the great Duke of Muscovy
would not permit him to pass with so many: which had occasion'd him to stay six moneths at
Smolensko, whence he had been forc'd to send back most of his people, and reduce them to the
number he then had about him, which was, 25. persons.
                  He also deliver'd us some Letters from the Armenian Archbishop, whom we had met at Astrachan,
and told us, there were arriv'd in that Citie some Provisions which had been sent us from
Nisnovogorod.
                  We saw that day, on our right hand, a very fair Countrey-house, which the King had built
upon the Hill call'd Kultcbe, for the convenience of hunting. We intended to lodge the next
night at the Village of Araseng, and to travel that day but six leagues, but the Inhabitants
told the Harbinger whom the Mehemandar had sent thither, to take up Quarters, that they
would not receive us, and that if we attempted to lodge there by force, they were able to prevent
it, and make us repent our rashness, not dissembling the design they had, to cut all our
Throats, if we came within the Village, They had not forgotten the affront which the Kaucha,
or Judge of the Village, had receiv'd, at our first passage that way, from the Ambassador
Brugman, who having desir'd water to wash his hands, and the poor man having brought him
troubled water such as the Brook did afford, cast it in his face, and the pot at his head; so that
we were forc'd to travel on. The Villages of Dowlet, Abath, and Ketzisan, taking example by
that of Araseng, in like manner deny'd us entertainment, and forc'd us to travel on three leagues
further, to the Village of Kulluskur, through such a bad and slippery way, that most of
our Horses were several times on their Noses, nay, it was day ere some got to the Quarters.
                  I was lodg'd at the Parson's of the Parish, and sent several times to desire him to come in and
Sup with me. But he would by no means come, and walk'd all night without Doors, grumbling
that his house was profan'd, by drinking Wine in it, and eating such Meats as are forbidden
by the Law of Mahomet.
                  Ian. 10. we had another ill day's journey, in regard the ground being frozen, the beasts we
rode on were so tir'd, that most of our people were forc'd to march afoot. Nay some were not

able to perform the journey, whom we were afterwards oblig'd to send for. We lodg'd that
night at the Village of Membre.
                  The 11. we came to the Citie of Caswin,Come to Calwin. where we were forc'd to continue nine dayes, till
fresh Horses and Mules could be got for the prosecution of our journey. Neer the Ambassadors
lodging there was a great Tree, full of Nails and Pebble-stones,The superstition of the Persians. which are so many marks of
the Miracles, that one of their Pyrs or Beats, who lies interr'd under that Tree; is wont to
do at that place, in healing the Tooth-ach, Agues, and several other Diseases. Such as are troubled
with the Tooth-ach touch the aking Tooth with a Nail or Pebble, which they fasten to
the Tree as high as they can reach with their mouths, and hope by that means to get ease. They,
whose imagination is so strong as to be ever the better by this kind of Cure, express their
acknowledgement thereof by tying certain Ribbands to the boughs of the Tree; though in other
respects these Miracles are not done gratis, but are very beneficial to a certain Religious man,
who hath the keeping of the Tree, and makes his advantage of the Offerings and Alms made
there. This profit, which is enough to maintain one man, hath encourag'd several Mountebanks
and Impostors, to expose their Cheats, in dressing up Trees with these trifles, and finding
Sepulchres of Pyrs where there never were any.
                  The 15. The Posanick, or Muscovian Ambassador, made a great entertainment for our
Ambassadors, and the chiefest of their Retinue, and treated us very Magnificently. It was in
Commemoration of the birth-day of Knez Iuan Basilouits, one of the chief Ministers of Muscovy,
whose favour he courted.
                  Ian. 20. we left Caswin,Leave Caswin. and leaving on our left hand, towards the Northwest, the way of
Solthania and Ardebil, which we had taken at our coming into Persia we took that of Kilan
directing our course Northward. We travell'd that day four leagues, for the most par over
Hills, manur'd and sowen, and lodg'd, at night, in the Village of Achibaba, at the foot of
a Mountain, on our right hand.
                  We were told, that Village was so call'd from an antient man of that name, who liv'd in the
time of Schich-Sefi, and obtain'd it of him, in memory of a Miracle which God had done in
his person, in reviving in him and his Wife, who were each of them neer a hundred years of
age, the heat of younger years, in so much that they had a Son, who had bestow'd on them
the Tomb, which they shew'd us, under a great Vault.
                  The 21. we pass'd through a fruitfull Country but somewhat uneven, to the Village of Tzitelly,
by some called Kellabath, that is, a place fit for the breeding of Cattel; so far as that
the Grass, which there is excellent good, and grows very plentifully, invites the Inhabitants
of Caswin to drive their Heards into those parts. The Vice-Daruga of Caswin, who accompany'd
the Ambassadors to this place, and Supp'd with them, entertain'd them a long time, and much
to their Diversion, with the relation of his life, and told them, he had been carried away in
his Infancy out of Georgia, which was his Countrey, in the time of Schach-Abas, during
the War he made in those parts, and that he had been transferr'd to Caswin with his Father
and Mother, who were then alive, and still Christians, though, in appearance, forc'd to embrace
the Religion of the Persians.
                  He told us also, that Abasculi made his advantage of our journey, as well as other Mehemandars,
to exact Provisions and other conveniences from the places which lay in their way;
but that there was not one half employ'd for the service of the Ambassadors. They made him a
Present of certain Ells of Cloath and Satin.
                  The 22. we travell'd seven leagues, all over Mountains and Rocks, interwoven with a Brook,
which thereabouts ran winding up and down, so as that we were forc'd to cross it above thirty
times, ere we got to the Village of Kurtzibaschi, where we lodg'd that night. The next morning,
we travell'd all along Mountains, which were not very high, but delighted the eye by a
diversity of colours, Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue, which afforded a very pleasant prospect.
But about noon, we could see nothing but Rocks, dreadfull for their height and steepiness, and,
in the evening, we came to the River Senderuth, which we cross'd by a Bridge, that joyns the
two Mountains through which it runs. We discover'd from the top of the Mountain, some pleasant
and fruitfull Valleys, at least if I may so call the other lower Mountains, which are till'd
and cultivated, and appear'd to us from the top of the Mountain as little Hillocks. This Village
belong'd heretofore to a Kurtzibaschi, or Colonel of a thousand Horse, who gave it his own
name, and was seated in a very pleasant place: but the houses were built onely of Earth and
Canes, whereto there adjoyned certain shepheards Huts, where with we made the best shift we
could.
                  The 23. we travell'd two leagues, very good way, along a Forest of Olive-Trees, at the
end whereof, we came to a place, antiently called Fauces Hyrcaniae,Fauces Hyrcaniae. but by the Persians, in
the time of Alexander the Great, as it is indeed to this day, Pylas. The passage is very narrow,
and serves for a Gate to the Province of Kilan. At the entrance of it, joyn two swift
Rivers, which fall down with a dreadfull noyse through the Rocks, under the name of the River
Isperuth, though before their joyning together, the greater of the two had the name Kisilosein,

and passing under a stone bridge, in order to its falling into the Province of Kilan, it
there again divides it self, and by two several Chanels, falls into the Caspian Sea.
                  This is a very fair Bridge,A Caravansera upon a Bridge. built on six Arches, each whereof hath a spacious Room, a Kitchin,
and several other conveniences, lying even with the water. The going down into it is by a stone
pair of stairs; so that this Bridge is able to find entertainment for a whole Caravanne.
                  At the end of the Bridge,A Dreadful Road. the road divides it self. One way leads through a delightful and
even Countrey, into the Province of Chalcal, and so to Ardebil, the other goes streight into
the Province of Kilan, and this last is the most dangerous and most dreadfull way of any, I
think, in the World. It is cut out of a Mountain which is pure Rock, and so steepy, that
they found it a hard matter to make way enough for the passage of one Horse or Camel loaden,
nay, in some places they have been forc'd to supply it with Mason's work, where the Rock fell
short.
                  On the left hand, the Rock reach'd up into the Clouds, so as that the top of it could not be
seen; and on the right, there was a dreadfull Abyss, wherein the River made its passage, with
a noyse, which no less stunn'd the ear, than the Precipices dazzled the eye, and made the head
turn. Not one among us, nor indeed of the Persians themselves, durst ride it up, but were
forc'd to lead their Horses by the Bridle, and that at a distance loosely, lest the beast, falling,
might drag his Master after him. The Horses came very gingerly, but the Camels stumbled
not at all, and were sure to set their feet in the steps, which had been purposely cut for them in
the Rock. At the top of the Mountain, we came to a house, where certain duties are paid.
The Receiver thereof made us a Present of several fruits, and we wondred much, considering
the time of the year, to see the Hedges all over the Valleys, flourishing, and full of blossoms.
                  But this very Mountain,Summer and Winter the same day. which was so steepy, teadious, and dreadfull on the one side, had
so pleasant and delightfull a descent on the other, that it was no hard matter for us to forget the
fright and trouble we had been in, in coming it up. It was all over clad with a resplendent vendure,
and so planted with Citron-Trees, Orenge-Trees, Olive-Trees, nay, Cypress-Trees,
and Box, that there is not any Garden in Europe could more delight the eye, nor more surprise
and divert the smell. The ground was in a manner cover'd with Citrons and Orenges, insomuch
that some of our people, who had never seen such abundance of them, made it their sport to
fling them at one another's heads. But what we were most astonish'd at, was, in one and the
same day, to see Winter chang'd to Summer, and the cold, which we had been sufficiently sensible
of in the morning, turn'd to a heat, which in a manner accompany'd us into Europe.
                  We lodg'd that night, at the foot of a Mountain, upon the River Isperuth, at the Village
of Pyle-rubar. 'Tis true the houses were little and incommodious, and scatter'd up and down
without any order; but there was not any but had its Garden, and Vineyard, its Citron-trees,
Orenge-trees, and Pomegranate-trees, and that in such abundance, that the Village being cover'd
therewith, we could hardly see any of the houses. It was encompass'd of all sides with
a very high Mountain, save only, that on the South-west side of the Valley, there was a little
Plain.
                  It may be said of this part, as indeed of all the Province of Kilan,The Provence of Kilan described. that it is a kind of terrestrial
Paradice. In the fifth Book of these Travels, we gave an account of its extent, of the
other Provinces whereof it consisted, and of its principal Cities; whereto we think fit to add in
this place, that the Province of Kilan extends it self like a Crescent, all along the Caspian Sea,
and that it is encompass'd like a Theatre, with a high Mountain, out of which arise several Rivers,
which refresh the plain Country, and make it very fruitfull, but in some places, especially
towards the Sea, so fenny, that the whole Province becomes by that means inaccessible. But
Schach-Abas hath remedied that inconvenience, by a bank or causey, which runs quite through
the Country, from Astarabath to Aastra; so that now people may travel without any inconvenience,
and that with any kind of Carriage, Horse, Camels, Wagons, &c.
                  There is no Province of all Persia so fertile and so abundant with Silk, Oyl, Wine, Rice,
Tobacco, Lemons, Orenges, Pomegranates, and other Fruits.Its Fruits. The Vines there are excellent,
and as big as a man at the Waste: but in regard they are commonly planted at the foot of some
tree, the branches spread themselves up the tree, even to the extremities of the boughs, so that
the Vintage becomes so much the more difficult. For he who is to gather the Grapes, is oblig'd
to fasten to the top of the tree a rope, having at the other end a stick as if it were to swing withall,
upon which he having seated himself, is drawn and swings as it were from one tree to another,
and from one bough to another, to gather the bunches.
                  The Mountain which encompasses it and spreads its extremities to the Caspian Sea-side,
is so cover'd with trees, that the whole Province seems to be enclos'd by a continued
Forest.
                  The neighbouring Sea, and all the Rivers of this Province are so well stor'd with Fish, the
grounds with Cattel, and the forests with all sorts of Venison and wild Fowl, that the Inhabitants
have not only wherewithall to live deliciously themselves, but may communicate of their
abundance to their Neighbours. Which is contrary to what Iohn de Laet, writes, after Iohannes

                     
                     

                     
                     
de Persia, to wit, that Mesanderan, which is part of the Province of Kilan, is so cold a
Country, that the fruits thereof hardly come to their full maturity. We know by experience,
that there is no Province in all Persia, where the air is better and more temperate than in Mesanderan,
and that it produces the best and fairest Fruits of any place in the Kingdom. Whence
it came, that Schach Abas, who knew it very well, preferr'd this Province before all the rest
of the Kingdom, and had such a kindness for it, that, willing to make it his ordinary residence,
he there built the City of Terabath, where he died.
                  The Inhabitants of this Province,The Kilek. especially the Kilek who live between Kesker and Mesanderan,
are self-conceited, hardy and apt to attempt any thing. They had heretofore their
particular King, nay even to this day, the King of Persia is not so absolute there, as in the
other Provinces of his Kingdom; as well in regard they need not much care for any Trading
with their Neighbours, since they have at home whatever is necessary, as that the Countrey
being in a manner inaccessible, they may easily avoid entertaining the Forces which might be
quarter'd upon them. There are but four wayes to come into the Province, and all very narrow:
the first comes from Chorasan-side, by the way of Astarabath; the second, from Mesandaran,
by the way of Ferabath; the third, by Pyle-rubar, and the fourth, by Lenger
Kunan.
                  All these waies are so narrow, that they hardly afford passage for a Camel. Such as are
afoot, as also horse-men, sometimes venture to get into it by the way of the Mountain; but
the way there also is so intricate, that the passages being maintainable by a few people, and the
Caspian Sea not being able to bear great ships, the Inhabitants have no enemies to fear but the
Cosaques, who sometimes fall into the Country in the night, to surprise and rifle certain Villages
upon the Sea-side.
                  We were then told,Revolt. that it was not above eight and thirty years, since Schach-Abas had reunited
that Province to his Crown; but that assoon as his Soveraignty was acknowledg'd there,
the Kilek, finding that Schach-Sefi, his Successor, signaliz'd the initials of his Reign by the executions
of the chiefest persons about the Court, revolted, took up arms, and chose a King, whom
the Persians call Karib-Schach.
                  This Karib was born in the Village hf Lechtenscha,The history of Karib-Shach. but descended from the antient Kings of
Lahetzan, in the Province of Kilan, and found credit enough in the Country to raise an Army
of 14000. men. His first action was the taking of the City of Resht, where he seiz'd on the
King's money, as he also did in all the other Cities of the Province, whereof he had possess'd himself
of all the avenues. The King of Persia, who was then at Caswin, coming to hear of this revolt
by the other Governours of the Country, Commanded Saru, Chan of Astara, Mahoned,
Chan of Kochtum and Seberabath, Heider, Sulthan of Keinluhesar and Tanchabun, and
Adam, Sultan of Mesanderan, to set upon Karib-Schach of all sides. To that end they divided
their forces into three Bodies, and went with two of them streight towards him, intending
to make use of the third, in case of necessity, as a reserve; but they found him so well posted,
that they were forc'd to retreat with loss.
                  Karib-Schach, instead of improving this first advantage, which might have given reputation
to his Arms, grew so insolent thereupon, and withall so negligent, that he permitted his people
to enlarge their quarters to the adjacent Villages, where they fell to merriment and making
good cheer, while he continued with some few about him at Kisma and Fumen. The Chans
who observ'd all his actions, had no sooner notice of it, but they got together again their three
Bodies, which made an Army of above 40000. men, with which they set upon the forces of
Karib-Schach in their quarters, and gave them an absolute defeat.
                  As to Karib himself, he had the time to get into a Garden, where he hid himself, behind one
of those trees which produce silk, and which those of the Countrey call Tut; but he was there
discover'd by one of the Domesticks of Emir-Chan, who knew him by his Cloaths. He intreated
that Thebni, or Servant, to save his life, by furnishing him with his Cloaths, and promis'd
him, in requital, a good sum of mony, besides the Present he made him in hand of a great many
Jewels. The Servant made as if he consented, but assoon as he got on Karib's Garment and
Sword, he said to him, It is I who am now King, and thou art but a Traytor, and thereupon
calling to some of his Camerades, he seiz'd upon him, and put him into the Palenk. Schach-Sefi
would needs see him, and had him brought to Caswin, where he then was, making his entrance
into it, accompany'd by five or six hundred Curtezans, who incessantly jeer'd him in his
Royalty, and did him a thousand indignities and affronts.
                  They began his execution by a very extraordinary punishment.A strange punishment. For Schach-Sefi caus'd him to
be shod, hands and feet, like a Horse, and told him he did it for his ease, in regard that being
accustom'd to go upon the fat and soft ground of Kilan, he would otherwise hardly endure the
stony and rugged wayes of Persia. Having suffer'd him to languish in that condition three dayes???
they brought him to the Maidan, where they set him on the top of a Pole, and kill'd him with
Arrows. The King having shot the first, oblig'd all the Lords of the Court to follow his example,
bidding those that lov'd him do as he had done. Upon that word, he was immediately

so cover'd with Arrows, that there was no shape of a man to be seen. The body was left
in that posture three dayes, expos'd to the sight of all, and then it was taken thence and interr'd.
                  Saru Chan, Governour of Astara, had express'd most zeal, courage, and conduct in that
War, whereby he got so much into favour with Schach-Sesi, that the sav'd the estate and life
of a rich Merchant, who was unfortunately engag'd in Karib's revolt. He liv'd at the Village
of Leschtensa, and if he did not openly declare for Karib, certain it is, he knew of his design,
and neglected to give norice of it to the Court: so that they were going to extirpate him and
his family, and to confiscate his Estate, which amounted to above a hundred thousand pounds
sterl, to the King's use, had not Saru-Chan's intercession procur'd his pardon.
                  Assoon as this revolt was appeas'd,The Kilek disarm'd. the Kilek were dis-arm'd, and they were forbidden to
buy Arms, upon so great penalties, that ever since that time they have not dar'd to have any,
not so much as a Sefir, or Ring, wherewith the Persians bend their Bows, so far were they
from being allow'd Fire-arms, Swords, Bows or Arrows. They are only permitted the use
of a certain Instrument like a Hedg-bill, which they call Das, having a handle of wood four
foot long, wherewith they cut wood, dress their Vies, and do several other things. The people
called Talisch, who live between Kesker and Mesanderan, who express'd their fidelity,
and affection to the King's service, in the War against Karib, have, on the contrary, the privilege
of using all sorts of Arms.
                  The Kilek wear a shorter Garment than the other Persians,Theirdbit. by reason of the moisture and
moorishness of the Country. They are not of so yellowish a complexion as the rest of the Persians,
but of a much clearer, in regard the air there is much more temperate, than in other parts
of the Kingdom.The Talisch The Women of the Talisch's are the handsomest of any in Persia, and cover
not their faces as much as the others do. Maids have their hair ty'd up in 24. or 25. tresses,
which hang down over their backs and shoulders, but married Women have but ten or twelve.
Their Garments are so short before, that they hide not their Smocks, and instead of shoes,
they were Sandals of wood, which they fasten with a string to the heel, and, with a button
or latchet of wood, between the great toe and the next to it: but in regard the ground is very
fat there upon any rain, they commonly go bare-foot as well as the men. The Caps worn by
the Kileck are of a coarse Cloath, but those of the Talisch are of black Lambskin. These two
people have each of them their particular Language, which differs from the Persian, only as
to Dialect; though there be so little rapport between that of Kilan and that of the Talisch, that
they have much ado to understand one the other. For example, to signify a Dog, a Persian will
say Sek, a Kilek Seggi, and a Talisch Spech. There is no Province in all Persia, where the Women
take more pains than they do in that of Kilan??? They are commonly employ'd in spinning,
and making Stuffs of Cotton, Flax, and Silk, as also in making Duschab, and Syrrop of
Wine, which they sell by jarrs, and tilling the ground for the sowing of Rice, about which
the men and women have their several employments. For the men hold the Plow, and make
the trenches to keep in the water, for the watering of the ground: The women carry the Corn
to field. The men sow the ground, going backwards as they cast the seed into it: The women
weed it. The men cut it, and the women bind it. The men bring it into the barn, but
the women thrash and sell it. They all profess the Turkish Religion, and are of the Sect of
Hanife.
                  They receiv'd us so kindly, that it was generally wish'd by us we might have made some stay
there: but we were forc'd to depart thence the 24. of Ianuary. We went, at first, along the
River side, having on our left hand a forest of Olive-trees, which gave us a pleasant shade, against
the heat of the Sun, which prov'd very great that day. Within a league of Pyle-rubar,
we saw, in the midst of the River, upon a great Rock, the ruins of a Castle, and the remainders
of a Bridge, both which they said had been pull'd down by Alexander the Great. We
afterwards pass'd over another Mountain, or rather a very high and craggy Rock, at the foot
whereof we came into a very smooth way, enamell'd with green, and spread over with new
springing grass, checquer'd with Violets, which extremely delighted not only the smell but also
the eye. We came at night to a Village, where we saw the Sepulchre of Iman Sade, in a little
Chapel built at the foot of a hill, which lay on our right hand. All the houses of the Village
were cover'd with lats and tiles, as they are in Europe, by reason of the rains, which, it
seems, are more frequent in those parts than any where else.
                  The 25. we got five leagues,Come to Rescht. and came at night to Rescht. The way at first, was somewhat
uneven and wooddy: but after a while, we found it planted with those trees which bear silk,
and at last we came to a plain and smooth way, having on both sides Corn-grounds, interwoven
with several deep trenches, such as those which in Flanders they call Water-gangs, into
which they let in the water by Sluces, and there keep it, for the watering of their grounds,
when the heat hath dry'd up the sources of the Rivers, nay indeed for the overflowing of them,
when need requires. They had indeed been at the pains to make Bridges over those moats or
trenches, but they were so ill kept in repair, that many of our people fell into the water. The

Inhabitants of the Country mind only the husbandry of Rice, and they have each of them his
house at the end of his piece of ground, about two or three hundred paces distant one from the
other.
                  The City of Rescht is the Metropolis of all Kilan,Metropolis of the Province of Kilan. and of a considerable bigness, but open
of all sides like a Village, and the houses of it are so hid within the trees, that a man at his entrance
into it may think, he is rather going into a Forest than a City, since there is no seeing
of it, till a man be within it. It lies two leagues distant from the Caspain Sea, and the Arabians,
in the Catalogue of their Cities, name it, Husum, and place it at 85. degrees, 10.
minutes latitude. The houses of it are not so well built, nor so fair, as those of the other Cities
of Persia, but they were all cover'd with tiles as ours, and not any but had adjoyning thereto
a great number of Citron-trees and Orenge-trees, which had then on them their second fruit,
ripe, of that years growth.
                  The Maidan, or Market-place, is very spacious, and full of shops, where are sold all sorts
of Commodities, especially Provisions, which are very cheap there, upon which accompt it
was, that our Mehemander treated us very magnificently during the aboad we made there,
which was five daies: The City of Rescht, though the greatest af all the Province, hath
no Chan, or chief Governour, but only a Daruga, whose name, at that time, was Alyculi-Beg.
                  Ian. 26. the Inhabitants of Rescht celebrated a Festival,A feast in honour of Aly. in Honour of Aly, with the same
Ceremonies in a manner, as we had seen at Scamachie, on the 7. of February, the year before:
and this Feast happen'd then in Ianuary, in regard the Persians regulate their Feasts according
to the Moon. They borrow'd of us a Drum, wherewith they made a mad kind of noise
in their Procession. The Preacher, who made a long relation of the Miracles of Aly, concluded
his Sermon with these blasphemous words, That, if Aly were not really God, he at least
came very neer the Divinity: Aly Chodda nist, amma ne dures Choddai.
                  We were here shewn the Sanctuary,Sefi Myrzas' Sanctuary. which Schach-Abas had ordered to be built, at the place,
where Sefi Myrza, his Son, had, by his command, been kill'd by Bebut-beg, as we have related
in the precedent Book of these Travels.
                  Ian. 30. we left Rescht,Leave Rescht. the weather rainy. We saw nothing at all that day but a Plain,
which brought us not only to our lodging that night, but also to the Frontiers of the Province
of Kilan, which is very even on that side. All the way was planted on both sides with Box,
and those trees which bear silk, and cross'd by many small Rivers, whereof such as were considerable
enough to have a name, are, the Pesi-chan, half a league from the City of Rescht,
then that of Chettiban, and somewhat less than a league thence, those of Pischeru and Lissar,
all which have Bridges, rais'd very high, by reason of the frequent inundations of the Rivers,
and so untoward to pass over, that they put a man into a fright: and notwithstanding all our
care, yet could we not prevent the Horse, which carried the Physicians baggage, from falling
into the River, whence we had much ado to get him out, by reason of the Fens on both sides
it. The last River we cross'd that day is called Tzomus; and they are all well stor'd with fish,
in so much that the King farms out the fishing of them, which brings him in yearly very considerable
sums. Having travell'd four leagues that day, we came at night to Kisma, neet the
Town of Fumen, or Pumen, where Karib-schach was defeated, and taken, as we related
before.
                  Ianuary the last, we got four leagues further, our way being planted all along with those
Trees which bear silk, and whereof there was so great a number, that they made a Forest.
We saw also that day great Vineyards, according to the Persian way.
                  Having travell'd about four leagues, we met with the Calenter, or King's Lieutenant in the
Government of Kesker, who came to meet us, accompany'd by thirty Horse. He had led after
him a Mule, loaden with Wine, Conserves, and other refreshments, wherewith he treated
the Ambassadors, and oblig'd them to make a Collation in the field.
                  The Chan, who was coming after him,Come to Kurab. accompany'd by a hundred persons of quality on
Hors-back, receiv'd the Ambassadors with great civility, and conducted us to the little Citie
of Kurab, where he invited us to his own house, and treated us with Fruit and Conserves,
making it his excuse, that their Fast permitted him not to keep us company, and entertain us
with flesh. The Collation ended, he had us all conducted to the Lodgings he had taken up for
us, ordered certain Gentlemen to wait on the Ambassadors, and sent them a Present of four
wild Boars.
                  The Chan's name was Emir, and he was son to a Georgian Christian, born at a Village neer
Eruan. He had been Circumcis'd in his youth, and had some time been Cup-bearer to Schach-Abas,
who had bestow'd that Government on him, in recompence of the service he had done
him at the siege of Eruan, and had given the reversion of his place of Cup-bearer to his Son. He
was an eloquent person, and obliging, and took much delight in talking of the Affairs and
Wars of Germany, and our manner of life. He told us he could not forbear loving the Christians:
but we were told one very extraordinary thing of him, and horrid to relate, to wit,

that having some time been in a teadious Disease, which having caus'd an universal contraction
in all his Members, the Physicians had order'd him one of the most extravagant remedies that
ever were heard of, which was, ut rem haberet cum cane foemina.
                  This little Citie of Kurab lies within two leagues of the Caspian Sea,Kurab Metropolis of the Province of Kelker. as that of Rescht do's,
and is hid within its Trees. They who call it Kesker, give it the name of the Province, wherein
it lies. In this place was born Schach-Sefi, who reign'd at the time of our Embassy. For
his Mother was brought to bed in this Citie, upon occasion of a journey which Schach-Abas
took into Kilan, wherein she follow'd him, along with Sesi Mersa her Husband. The house,
wherein he was born, belong'd to a rich Merchant, named Chotza Mahmud; but in regard
a Prince, Heir to the Crown, had his birth there, it was converted into a Sanctuary.
                  February the first,FEBRUA we left Kurab,The Ambassadors leave Kurab. about ten in the morning, having very fair weather,
save that the heat was greater than we could have wish'd. Emir-Chan conducted us a league
or better out of the Citie, where he took leave, intreating us to be carefull of his Calenter,
who had order to accompany us through his Government. This Calenter was a young man, of
an excellent good nature, and diverted us in our way, by shooting with the Bow, and shewing
tricks with a half-pike, at which exercise he had an admirable sleight.
                  Having travell'd two leagues, we were got to the Caspian Sea-side, whence we saw the
Countrey, which is all cover'd with Trees and Forests towards the North and South, spreading
it self like a Crescent a great way into the Sea, on the right hand, from about Mesanderan,
and Ferahath, and on the left, from about Astra. We travell'd about a league along the
the Caspian Sea-side, and lodg'd at night, upon the Torrent Nasseru, in a house calld Ruasseru-kura,
which had but two Chambers in all, so that being streightned for room, most of
our people were forc'd to ly abroad, at the sign of the Seven-Stars.
                  The 2. we travell'd six leagues or better, along the Sea coast, going North-westward. We
cross'd over that day fourteen little Rivers, or rather so many great brooks, and among others,
those of Sehibern, Dinatsar, Chalessera, Alarus; and Nabarrus. The River of Dinatsar,
which is about the mid-way, serves for a common Frontier to the Goverments of Kesker and
Astara, which oblig'd the Calenter of Kesker, who had accompany'd us so far, to take leave,
and recommend us to the conduct of the Calenter of Astara, who waited for us on the River
side. The Canton is called Kargaru. The Calenter carried us out of the highway, and conducted
us through Corn-ground to a Village named Sengar-hasara, where we lodg'd that night,
and found, brought thither, before us, five wild boars which they had hunted, purely upon
our accompt, and for our entertainment. All the Forests of those parts are well stor'd with
them, in regard the Persians, not daring to eat them, are not much inclin'd to the hunting of
them.
                  The 3. we departed betimes in the morning, in snowy and rainy weather, and continu'd
our way along the Caspian Sea, drawing towards East-north-east. Our way lay so neer the
Sea, that the Horses many times went into the water up to the Girts, nay some of our people
fell, horse and man, into the water: so that this prov'd one of the worst dayes journey we had,
especially for this, that, after we had travell'd seven large leagues, we were forc'd to lodge
that night in a wretched Village, named Hove-lemur, where all we could get was only a house
over our heads.
                  The 4. we were upon our way again very betimes in the morning, having receiv'd fresh horses.
We travell'd four leagues along the Sea-coast, going towards the North. Then we pass'd
through a Forest of two leagues, and, in that space of ground, met with two and twenty
Rivers; whereof the chiefest are called Lome, Konab, and Beskeschan. The Bridges we were
to pass over, were so bad, that many of our company fell into the water, nay there were three
Peasants and four horses drown'd, and six more died by the way.
                  The Chan of Astara, with a troop of 200. horse, met us within half a league of the Village,
where we were to take up our quarters, and accompany'd the Ambassadors to their lodgings,
which he had taken up for them in houses scatter'd up and down among the trees. The
name of the Village, as also of the River, which runs through it, is Choskedehene. The word
Choskedehene signifies, dry-mouth, and they have given it that name, for this reason, that,
the Sea is so shallow there, that the Fish cannot get into the River. The Chan lives at Astara,
which place hath its name from the Province, and is an open place without any walls, as Rescht
is, within a quarter of a league of the Caspian Sea. His name was Saru-Chan, a person furnish'd
with all the qualities requisite in a Governour of a Province.
                  Feb. 6. which was the last day of their Lent, he made a great entertainment for the Ambassadors,
whereat he discover'd not only the magnificence of his disposition, but also the excellency
of his wit, by the noble discourses that pass'd between him and the Ambassadours.
Among other things, he gave them all the particulars of the War, occasion'd by Karib-Sehach's
revolt, wherein he had been in person, and had brought away his table-cloath, which, being
of green Satin with Gold-flowers, was laid at this entertainment. That service, with other he
had done upon several other occasions, had rais'd him so much into the King's favour, that he

had appointed him for the Embassy into the Indies, whither he was to go the following Spring,
to which end he had already received his dispatches. He confirm'd to us what we had been told
before, of the danger we might fear from the Cosaques, adding thereto, that it was not two
years since they had plunder'd the City of Rescht, and that it were not amiss we stood on our
guard, and had our Arms fixt.
                  The Vines in these parts are so big, that they exceed a man's bulk. I have said as much before,
though I believe some will hardly believe it: but besides that all who travell'd with us,
are eye-witnesses of this truth, I may allege, to make good what I affirm, the Authority of
Strabo, who saies the same thing of the Vines of Margiana, which is part of the Province of
Chorasan, and adds thereto, that no stock almost but yields an ordinary pail-full of Wine;
which is very certain, and yet I have some reason to doubt of what he further affirms, that the
bunches there are above four foot long.
                  We saw neer Astara at the foot of the mountain of Schindan, the Village of Schich-Sahadan,
which enjoyes an absolute exemption, granted it, upon the accompt of the Sepulchre of
Schich-Sahadan, Aly's Master,
                  Febr. 7. we got seven leagues further,Come to the Province of Lengerkunan. along the Sea-side, and came, by a very steight
passage, into the Province of Lengerkunan. The only way to come into it is by a Bank, rais'd
between the mountains and the fenns, besides which there is no other passage. At the end of the
said bank, we came to the River Serdane, and afterwards to the Town of Lenkeran; upon the
River Warsasaruth. This Town, as also all the adjacent Country, derives its name from the
easy anchorage of shipping thereabouts, though, to speak rigorously, there is no haven in
those parts, but only a kind of Bay, between two Capes, or Promontories, which reach a
great way into the Sea, one on Lenkeran-side, which is cover'd with trees, on the other on
Kisilagats-side, on which there is nothing but canes. But the Sea thereabout is so shallow, that
little Vessels can hardly get in there; and when they are in, they ly exposs'd to the violence
of the East-wind.
                  Geore Dictander saies, in the Relation of his Travels, that, in the year 1603. there came to
that place by Sea an Ambassador from Rudolph II. Emperour of Germany, and that he died
there with most of his retinue: but the Inhabitants thereabouts, from whom I would have inform'd
my self of that particular, knew nothing of it. The Kurtzibaschi hath the revenue of
the Countrey allow'd him as part of his pay; though our Mehemandar and the Persians, for
what reasons I know not, would have perswaded us, that it belong'd to the Chan of Ardebil,
and depended on his Government. We were receiv'd there by a Visir, or Secretary, who had
the over-sight of the Demesn in those parts.
                  We continu'd there the 8. 9. and 10. as well to refresh the Camels, which the ill and slippery
waies had almost wearied off their legs, as in expectation of the rest of our retinue, who
were not yet come up with the baggage, and with them fresh horses, for the better prosecution
of our Journey.
                  The 11. we left Lenkeran,Leave Lenkeran. and travell'd five leagues on to Kisilagats, crossing that day four
great Rivers, to wit, those of Kasiende, Noabine, Tzili, and Buladi, the three former over
Bridges, and the last, which was very broad, in little Boats, swimming over the horses. At
our coming out of the River, we were forc'd to travel with much inconvenience, for half a
league or better, through the water, which the adjacent Sea had forc'd up there, and to send the
Baggage by Sea, in six great Fisher-boats. The Sea-side, in those parts, is cover'd all over with
Canes, as are also the Islands along the Coast, where the Cosaques some times lye in ambush,
to surprize and set upon the ships which pass that way, as also in expectation of an opportunity
to cross over to the Continent.
                  At our coming out of the said water, we found the Lord of that place, who was come to
meet us, accompany'd by a hundred persons on hors-back.
                  The little City of Kisilagats,The City of Kisilagats. that is, red, or gilt wood, hath no walls, no more than any of
the other Cities of those parts, and lies in a plain, half a league, or better, from the Sea, towards
the North-west, upon a little River, called Willeschi. Sulfahar-Chan sold it heretofore to the Chan
of Ardebil, by whom it was left to his Son, Hossein Sultan, who still enjoyes it. The mountain
of Kilan presented it self to our sight, towards the West-north-west, sinking by degrees
into little hills, towards the Countrey of Mokan. At the foot of the mountain, there were eral
Villages, among others, those of Buladi, Matzula, Buster, and Thaliskeran, and abundance
of trees, planted in a streight line, along a vast piece of Meadow-ground, where there
was excellent Pasture for Cattel. I conceive this to be the place which Strabo speaks of, when
he says, that, towards the Portae Caspiae, there is a fertile plain, very fit for the breeding of
Horses. He adds, that it is able to keep fifty thousand breeding Mares, which number the
Kings of Persia were wont to have kept there. But this is not true, at least there is no such thing
now: though a Military Officer of the Duke of Holstein's, who made it his bragg, that he had
travell'd into Tartary, though he had not been beyond Astrachan, being question'd concerning
the truth of this breeding-place, had the confidence to affirm, that what Strabo had said of it,
was very certain.
                  
                     
About these parts, and in the neighbouring Mountains, are the Countries of Kuawer, Maranku,
and Deschiewend, and the Village of Dubil, otherwise called Chatifekeka, the Inhabitants
whereof were extirpated,The Inhabitants of a Village extirpated. by the express command of Schach Abas, for the abominable
lives they led. They had their meeting in the night time at some private houses, where, after
they had made good cheer, they blew out the Candles, put off their Cloaths, and went promiscuously
to the work of Generation, without any respect of age or kindred, the Father many
time having to do with his own Daughter, the Son, with the Mother, and the Brother, with
the Sister. Schach Abas coming to hear of it, ordered all the Inhabitants of the Village, to be
cut to pieces, without any regard or distinction of age or sex, and peopled it with others. I
conceive, it is of the Inhabitants of these parts, that we are to understand what Herodotus affirms,
of their going together, without any shame, and publickly, after the manner of Beasts.
Over against Kisilagats, and about three leagues from the Continent, there are two Islands named
Kelechol and Aalybaluck.A false Miracle of Aly. The latter, which is three leagues, or Farsangs in length, hath
its name upon this accompt, that Aly being there one day, extremely put to it for fresh water
to quench his thirst, God immediately caus'd to break forth out of the ground a Spring of fresh
water, which is to be seen there to this day.
                  Febr. 12. we travell'd on, through a plain Country, but cross'd by several small Rivers, the
chiefest whereof were the Vskeru, and the Butaru, and we lodg'd at night, at Elliesdu, a Village
seated at the entrance of the Heath of Mokan, at the foot of a hill, which is very fruitful,
as is also the rest of the Country, on the mountain-side. It belong'd to a Military Officer, named
Beter Sulthan, who had his ordinary residence at a place six leagues thence. The houses of
this Village were very wretched ones, as being built only with laths nail'd across, and plaister'd
over with clay. They were inhabited by Souldiers, on whom the King bestows the revenue
of his Demesin in these parts, with certain Lands which they are oblig'd to cultivate.
                  In this Village,A harbarous action of the Ambassador Brugman. the Ambassador Brugman caus'd a Persian to be kill'd with cudgelling. His
Groom would have gone into the first house he came to, with one of the led-horses: the Kisilbach,
or soldier, who was the Master of it, told him, that his house was free from quartering,
and that besides, he had no convenience for the entertainment of horses, whereupon, having a
stick in his hand, he therewith struck the horse over the head, but very slightly. The Ambassador
Brugman, who saw this contestation, was so enrag'd at the resistance of the Kisilbach,
that he immediately alighted, and ran in to him.
                  The Kisilbach, who said afterwards that he knew him not, and was far from imagining, that
an Ambassador would engage himself in such a business, and, as a Soldier could not brook an
affront in his own house, stood upon the defensive, and gave the Ambassador such a blow over
the arm with his stick, that he was forc'd to cry out for help.
                  His Domesticks came in upon the noise, and gave the Kisilbach such a beating, that he was
mortally wounded, and had much ado to crawl into the next house, to avoid their further fury.
The Ambassador, notwithstanding all this, would needs make his complaint to the Mehemandar,
of the insolence of the Kisilbach; whereto the other reply'd, that he knew not what to do
in the business; that he had no power over the Kisilbachs; that the Superiour Officer was not
there, to give him satisfaction, and, withall this, that he who had injur'd him, had receiv'd
such a chastisement, as he thought he could hardly ever recover, and that if he were not satisfy'd,
he might do himself what further satisfaction he thought fit. Brugman, presuming upon
this permission, immediately sent to plunder the Kisilbach's house, and order'd his horse and
arms to be brought away. The next day, he got together all the retinue, and caus'd it to be
publish'd by sound of Drum, that all should get on horse-back, in order to their departure out
of the Village, and that all who should stay there, after the Ambassadors were gone, might do
it at their own peril.
                  Not one of the Company knew his design, no, not his Collegue; but it was soon discover'd,
when he himself, being got on horse-back, and making a halt before the Ambassador's Lodging,
told the Mehemandar, that he should bring forth the man, who had struck him the day
before. The Mehemandar told him, he was so dangerously wounded, that he was not able
to rise; but the Ambassador not satisfy'd with that answer, order'd him to be brought thither
in a Coverlet, and, notwithstanding the mediation of the other Persians, who with great submissions
begg'd the Kisilbach's pardon, he commanded an Armenian, who was an Interpreter
for the Turkish Language, named Mark-Filerossein, to beat him with a great Cudgel, after the
same manner as he had been beaten the day before.
                  This merciless Rogue gave him one blow over the arm,Causes a Kisilbach to be kill'd in cold blood. and another upon the side, wherewith
he dispatch'd the poor Kisilbach, who stirr'd a little afterwards; but when the Armenian would,
by order from Brugman, have prosecuted the execution, he found the man quite dead. The
Ambassador seeing him in that posture, said, 'tis very well, he hath what he deserv'd; and thereupon
turning to the Mehemandar, and the other Persians, he told them, that if Schach-Sefi did not
revenge him for the affront be had receiv'd, he would return again in a short time, so well attended,
that he should do himself satisfaction. The other Soldiers made it appear by their demeanour,

that they wanted neither will nor courage to express their resentment of the injury
done them, and cut all our throats, and I know not whether it were the presence of the Mehemandar,
that prevented them from doing it; but certain it is, that it would have been no hard
matter for them to do it, and that it was the effect of a miraculous providence, that we escap'd
that misfortune.
                  We travell'd that day, which was the 13. of February, two leagues over the Heath of Mokan,
and lodg'd, that night, at Oba, in Shepherds hurts. The Mehemandar, who had staid behind
in the Village, overtook us at night, and brought us word that the Kisilbach was dead,
and demanded of the Ambassador Brugman, the Horse, Arms, and other things, which he had
from the deceas'd person, to be sent to his Widdow and Children, whom he had left in a very
sad condition.
                  I observ'd that morning, that the Sun rose towards East-south-east, and consequently, that
the Load-stone declin'd 24. degrees from the North towards the West, and at Oba, I found the
Sun, at noon, at the height of forty degrees, forty eight minutes, and consequently, that
the elevation of the Pole, under that Meridian, was thirty nine degrees, twenty eight minutes.
                  The Sea-coast lay from South-west to North-east, and we had a sight of the mountain of
Scamachie, towards the North.
                  As concerning the Heath of Mokan, it is held to be sixty Farsangs in length, and twenty in
breadth. The Turks call it Mindunluck, that is, a thousand wayes, or thousand holes, at which
the smoak comes out, and the Persians, Mogan, or Mokan. It is inhabited by several peoples
and families, whose Predecessors, having born Arms under the command of Iesid against
Hossein, were banish'd into this Desert, and they are not permitted to live either in Cities or
Villages. In Summer, they encamp at the foot of the Mountain; and in Winter, they lodge
in Tents upon the Heath.
                  They subsist by their Cattel, but so poorly, that it is as much as they can do. Whence it
comes, that they are called Sumek Rajeti, either for that, from bone to bone, that is, from Father
to Son, they are subject to the King no otherwise than as the most miserable Slaves are, or
that they have hardly left them wherewith to cover their bones. They are a kind of Savages,
and their chief families are called Chotze Tschaubani, Tekle, Elmenku, Hatzikasilu, Sulthan
baschelu, Carai, Ardenduschenlu, Chaletz, &c. I speak in another particular Treatise of the
origine of these families, and the manner of life of these people.
                  The 14. we travell'd three leagues,A Robber General of an Army. drawing towards the North, and lodg'd at night among
the Hatzicasilu. We saw, in a Chapel by the way, the Sepulchre of Bairam Tekle Obasi.
He was the famous Robber, who liv'd in the time of Schach Abas, who coming to be head of a
strong party of Toryes, did abundance of mischief to the Bassa Tzakal Ogli, who was entred
Persia with a Turkish Army, insomuch that there hardly pass'd a day, but he sent some Turks
heads to the King.
                  These little advantages, and the booty he got, improv'd his retinue to the number of twelve
thousand men, who did the Turks more mischief than the Royal Army could. Schach-Abas
requited his services, by honouring him with the quality of Chan, and bestowing on him the
revenue of certain Villages, and some Lands, to maintain the new Dignity.
                  We lodg'd that night in Hurts, and were hardly laid down, ere we heard the noise of a great
volley of small shot; which gave us a hot alarm, and oblig'd us to put our selves into a posture
of defence, in expectation of some engagement. We thought at first, that the Kisilbachs had a
design to revenge the cruelty, which the Ambassador Brugman had exercis'd the day before on
one of their Camerades; but we understood soon after, that what had been done, was by order
from the Muscovian Poslanick, purposely to frighten the Ambassador Brugman, though he
would make us believe, it was to honour him, out of an imagination he seem'd to have, that it
was the said Ambassador's birth-day.
                  The 15. we travell'd eight leagues along the Heath, and lodg'd within a quarter of a league
of the River Aras.
                  We intended to take up our quarters that night at Tzauat; but understanding that Areb, Chan
of Scamachie, was lodg'd there with his whole Court, and that he would stay there all the next
day, we also resolv'd to continue the 16. at the place where we were.
                  We had some reason to be distrustfull of Areb-Chan, by reason of what had happen'd between
us at our first passage: but he made it appear that the Persians have this also common with all
Generous minds, that they can forget injuries. For he did us no unkindness; nay, on the contrary,
as long as we were in his Government, he let slip no occasion of obliging us, laying the
cause of our misunderstanding one the other, on the Interpreter Rustan, who had forsaken us,
and, as he said, had made him several bad reports of us, not doubting but he had said as much
to us of him, and protesting that if he had him, his head should go off for it. He order'd us to
be receiv'd by a Person of Quality of his retinue, upon the first news were brought him of
our being come to the River Aras, and made us a Present of three baggs of Wine, which came

to us very seasonably, in as much as that day, and the day before, we had been but poorly
treated. Aetzebeg, who had been our Mehemandar at our former passage, came also to visit
the Ambassadors, and presented them with an excellent Greyhound-bitch.
                  The 17. we cross'd over the famous River Araxes, near Tzauat, where they had made a
Bridge of Boats, which they call Tzissi. The antient Historians and Geographers speak so
differently of this River, that I conceive it will not be amiss I said somewhat here of it by
the way.
                  True it is,The River Aras. most of them put it in the Province, wherein it really lies, but they are mistaken
in the description of its Course, in as much as they do not well understand Q. Curtius, who
speaks of it in two several passages, but in a different sense. For in the 5. Book he puts it in
Persida, and sayes its course is Southward; and in the 7. Book, he makes it pass through Media,
and to fall into the Caspian Sea. Nor does Strabo express himself more clearly. Raderus,
in his Commentaries upon Q. Curtius, thinks to make these passages very clear, by saying,
that the River Medus, into which the Araxes fall, hath its course, at first, from North to
South, and that it falls into the Caspian Sea. But he is mistaken; for it is impossible, that River
should make its way through the dreadfull mountain Taurus, which is many leagues in
breadth, and which runs through all Persia, nay indeed all Asia, and pass from Persepolis towards
the Caspian Sea. But the truth is, there are two Rivers of the same name of Araxes in
Persia; one, in Media, the other in Persida. As to that which passes by the walls of Persepolis,
now known by the name of Schiras, Q. Curtius calls it Araxes, as he gives to the Iaxartes,
which passes to the Frontiers of the Scythians, the name of Tanais, and that of Cancasus
to the Eastern part of the mountain Taurus, for which it would much gravel him to shew any
reason.
                  The Persians call that which is in Persida, Bend-Emir, by reason of a great Miracle, which
they believe Aly did there, and it falls into the Ocean near the Persian Gulf. That which we
cross'd over in the Heaths of Mokan, still keeps its name, which is deriv'd, if we may credit
Eustathius, from the Greek word , which signifies to pluck, in as much as, when it overflows,
it plucks up, and carries along with it whatever lies in its way. It rises out of the
mountains of Armenia, behind the great Ararat, and receiving into its Chanel, the waters of
many other Rivers, the chiefest whereof are Karasu, Senki, Kerni, and Arpa, it goes near Karasu,
a great way into the Land, and falls soon after near Ordabath, with such a noise, as is
heard above two leagues thence, in the Plain of Mokan, which lies very low, in comparison
of Armenia and Schiruan.
                  Its course there is very slow, and after it is joined, viz. 12. leagues above Tazuat, with the
River Cur or Cyrus, (which is as big as it self, and comes Northwar'd out of Georgia or Gurtzistan)
it falls into the Caspian Sea. Whence it appears, that Ptolomy, and those who follow
him, are mistaken, when they affirm, that the Araxes and the Cyrus fall into the Caspain
Sea by two different chanels; as also when they say, that the City of Cyropolis was that which
is now called Scamachie. This is inferr'd by Maginus, from the degrees of Latitude which Ptolomy
gives him. But if it were so, we must put these two Rivers, not above, but below the
City, towards the South, in as much as we found their Conflux or meeting together, which
the Persians call Kanschan, at thirty nine degrees, fifty four minutes, and Scamachie, at forty
degrees, fifly minutes, that is, thirteen leagues thence, and under another Meridian. And
indeed we found such a distance between them, when we travell'd those parts. Nor is there any
other River, eminent enough or big enough, within nineteen dayes journey of Scamachie, on
either side of it, to deserve that name.
                  The 17. we took up our Quarters at Tzauat, where we were receiv'd, and magnificently
treated by the Mehemandar, whom the Chan had sent to us. This Villge derives its name
from the Arabiau word Tzauat, which signifies a passage, in regard that, at the crossing of
this River, people are oblig'd to shew their pass-port, which is done, to prevent the entrance
of the Turks into the Kingdom.
                  The 19. we travell'd eight leagues, for the most part, over barren Lands, and a desert
Country, cover'd with Reeds, and lodg'd, that night, at the foot of the mountain of Scamachie,
in three Matzuchs, or round Hutts, which had been purposely set up there for us. That
day dy'd our Painter, whose name was Tierry Nieman, after he had been shaken several
months together by a quartane ague, whereto a flux joyning carried him away in four dayes.
He died by the way in a Wagon, and in ill weather. We had him buried the 22. before the
City of Scamachie, in the Church-yard belonging to the Armenians, with the ordinary Ceremonies
of our own Country.
                  The 20. we were upon our way betimes in the morning,The mountain of Scamachie that we might, in good time, pass
over the mountain of Scamachie, which extends it self in those parts like a Crescent, towards
the East, from the Sea, along the River Cyr, and it is called there, Lengebus tachi, by reason
of a Village, named Lengebus, which is upon the op of the mountain.
                  The rain, which was then so cold, that we thought Winter coming on again, had so broken

the high-wayes, that this was one of the saddest dayes journey we had ever since our first setting
forth.
                  The Ambassadors, and such others as were well mounted, got to the City ere day-light was
shut in, but it was very late ere the rest reach'd it; nay some got not thither till after midnight,
some, not till the next morning.
                  The Camels, which being so heavily loaden, where not able to get up so narrow and slippery
a way as is that of the Mountain, came not till eight dayes after. The Chan had assign'd us the
same Quarters we had had, at our former passage that way; so that we were all lodg'd at the
houses of the same Armeniaus, our antient Landlords. They receiv'd us very kindly, and as
to the Ambassadors, the Chan sent them a Supper from his own Kitchin.
                  For my own particular, I had several Presents sent me from my friends, and Tutors, as
Maheb Aly, the Molla, Imanculi, and Chalil, who sent me several dishes of Apples,
and Grapes, and came to see me the next day, to examine how I had improv'd my self in their
Language.
                  Feb. 22. The Chan and Calenter came in person to see the Ambassadors,The Chan treats the Ambassadors. and invited them
and their retinue to a Supper. In the evening, the Chan sent horses, to bring them to the Palace.
He treated us magnificently; and entertain'd us with very civil discourses, and such as
were the more obliging, in that we afterwards found the effects of them, during our aboad
at Scamachie, where we continu'd five weeks; during which, we had the divertisement of
several hunting matches, and were treated a great Feasts, which the Chan made from time to
time purposely for us.
                  Alexi Savinowits,MARC. Ambassador of Muscovy, made a great and sumptuous entertainment on
the first of March in commemoration of the birth of the Great Duke, his Master.
                  The 3. 6. and 10. the Chan treated us at his own Palace, to celebrate their Naurus, or
Newyear. Chalip, the Minatzim, or Astrologer, belonging to the Chan, sent me, for
my new-years-gift, a fat Lamb.
                  March 14. Areb-Chan receiv'd an assurance of the continuance of the King's favour towards
him,How the K of Persia assures the Chans of his favour. according to the custome, by the Present of a new Garment: in as much as when the
Chans and Governours have made their ordinary Presents, the King sends an express to them,
to assure them, either of his favour or displeasure; whereof the Ceremony is this. The King's
Envoy or Express, being come within three or four leagues of the City, sends a Messenger, to
give the Governour notice of it, and to let him know he brings him good news. The Governour,
who many times is not sure to return again, takes his leave of the City, as if he were
not to come thither any more, and goes a league out of the City, to meet the Envoy, accompany'd
by all his friends.
                  As soon as the Envoy sees the Governour coming, he makes a halt, and the Governour
alights, and puts off his Sword, Garment, and Turbant, and in that posture approches the
Envoy, who hath in a Box cover'd with some rich Tapistry, a Letter of grace, with a new
Garment, or else an order to bring the Governour's head. If the Kings favour be confirm'd to
him, he receives from the Envoy, the new Garment, which he kisses at the collar, touches
with his fore head, and then puts it on.
                  If the Envoy hath an order to bring away the Governour's head, he presently hath it cut off,
puts it into the Box, and immediately returns. There are diverse examples of these executions
in the time of Schach-Abas, as also in that of Schach-Sefi, The former caus'd to be executed
after this manner, Ahmad, Chan of Hemedan, Kaban, Chan of Orumi, and Baisunkur
Sulthan, Governour of Magasburt; and the later put to death, by an Envoy, Iarali, Sulthan
of Maku, and Moral, Sulthan of Bajesid. But this last caus'd them to be strangled, and afterwards
to be flead, and order'd their skins, fill'd with Hay, to be set in the high-way, because
they had over-easily deliver'd up those places wherewith he had entrusted them.
                  Areb-Chan intreated the Ambassadors to be present at an action, which he knew could not
be otherwise than advantageous to him, in so much that he had got a large dose of drink, ere
he went out of the City. He was mounted on an excellent Roan horse, without any Arms,
causing to be led before him several other gallant horses with rich trappings, and having about
his person fifteen of his Guard, with their Carabins, and a retinue of about four hundred men
besides the Ambassadors, and the Calenter, who accompany'd him with their Domesticks. He
march'd in this order, as far as the King's Garden, without the City, halting several times,
to make the Company drink, and causing several young Lads to dance in the mean time. His
two Sons, whereof the elder was but 20. years of age, and the younger 18. both very handsome
well shap'd persons, follow'd him with most of the Inhabitants of the City, and certain
men on horse-back, who were cover'd with Lynxes-skins, and the furres of Buchar-Sheep,
and carried on the tops of long Poles, certain Turks Heads fill'd with Hay, and the Colours,
which Areb had taken from them.
                  He alighted before the Garden, and found the King's Envoy at the entrance of it, attended
by three Servants, and holding the Box in his hand. The Chan being come within ten or twelve

paces of the Envoy, he very cheerfully put off his Garment and Turbant, but perceiving the
Envoy stood a while, without saying ought to him, he began to be a little startled and out of
countenance, till the Envoy said to him, Ai, Areb-Chan, whereto Areb answer'd, Nediersen,
what saiest thou? The Envoy continu'd, Schach Sefi ne chales kunderdiwe rakem, Schach
Sefi dnsti sen, that is, Schach Sefi sends thee a Garment, and a Letter of Favour; thou
art certainly belov'd of the King. Whereto the Chan reply'd very couragiously, Scahung dowletti
berkarar, olsumwe birkuni minkun olsun men seahung birkari kulim: that is, May the King's
Wealth continue for ever, and may every day of his be as a thousand; I am one of the King's
old Servants.
                  
                  He thereupon took the Garment, with very great submission. It was of Sea-green Satin.
The Envoy help'd him to put it on, with a Rochet of cloath of Gold, a Girdle, and Turbant.
                  The Envoy had, for his pains, a Present of certain Tumains. Then the Casi, or Judge,
made a Prayer for the King's health, which ended, the Chan's Steward, cry'd out, Schach
dowetine, Kasiler kuweline, Chan saglukine, alla dielim; that is, We pray for the prosperity
of the King, the success of his Soldiers, and the health of the Chan, whereto all the people
answer'd, Alla, Alla, Alla.
                  These Ceremonies ended, the Trumpets sounded, and the Tymbrels were play'd on, and
and the Chan return'd to the City, causing to be carried, before him, the Turks heads and
Colours, which, at his coming thence, had march'd after him. The Chan invited the Ambassadors
to Dinner; but he himself had drunk so liberally, that he was forc'd to rise from
Table, and the Company soon after withdrew.
                  The 22. being Maundy Thursday,Armenian Ceremonies. the Armenians performed the Ceremony of the washing
of Feet, in memory of the beginning of our Saviour's Passion: They all came to Church,
where the Priest wash'd the right foot of the Men, and the left foot of the Women, and made
thereon the sign of the Cross, with Butter, which had been consecrated to that purpose: And
that done, he was cast into a Chair by twelve men, who rais'd him up into the air, with exclamations
of joy, and kept him there, till he had promis'd to treat them with a Dinner.
                  The 25. the Armenians began their year,The Armenians begin the year at Easter. and in regard that day fell on their Easter, they
made a great Procession out of the City. The Chan would needs see it, and made a great extertainment
for us, during which, the Armenians stood with their Banners, Crosses and Images
before his Tent. Which they did only to please the Persians, in as much as, when the Muscovian
Ambassador, who was troubled to see those poor people stand there so long in that posture,
sent them word, that they might be gone with their Images, they made answer, that
they ought not to stirr thence, without express order from the Chan. The Armenian Women
gave us the divertisement of their dancing, in three Companies, which successively reliev'd one
another. The Chan gave us another kind of sport, by letting loose among the People, two
Wolves, ty'd to long Ropes, to be drawn back when they pleas'd. He caus'd also the head
of one of those wild Beasts which they call Ahu's to be cut off at one blow with a Cymitar. That
was done by this sleight, first they gave the Beast a blow over the back, which made it lift up
the head, so that they could hardly miss it. That night I was stung by a Seorpion.
                  The 26. came to Scamachie,The Ambass. intended for Holstein comes to Scamachie. Imanculi, whom the King of Persia sent Ambassador to the
Duke of Holstein, our Master. The Chan invited him to Dinner with our Ambassadors. The
next day, they had a long conference together, for the regulation of our journey, for which
we set all things in order.
                  The 29. Imanculi Sulthan came to visit the Ambassadors, to take leave of them, and to assure
them, he would follow within eight dayes. Abasculi-Beg, our Mehemandar, took also
his leave of us, and return'd toward the Court, and we had another appointed us, named
Hosseinculi-Beg, who was ordered to conduct us to the Frontiers of Persia.
                  The 30. we left Scamachie,The Ambassadors leave Scamachie. accompany'd by the Chan and Calenter, who, with a great body
of horse, brought us half a league out of the City, where he treated us magnificently. Having
mutually taken leave with the greatest expressions of civility, the Chan return'd, with his
Company, to Seamachie, and we took our way towards Pyrmaras, whither we came in the
evening, after we had travell'd, that afternoon, three leagues.
                  March the last, we were on our way by eight in the morning, and we got that day six
leagues, all over mountains, whence we had not the sight of so much as one Village. At night we
came into a Valley, to the Village of Cochani, where we lodg'd.
                  April 1. we travell'd seven leagues,APRIL. over hills and dales, till we came to the Village of Bahel,
otherwise called Surrat, from the fruitfulness of the Country, especially by reason of the abundance
of Millet growing there, beyond what any other part of Persia affords.
                  The 2. we got out of the mountain into the plain Country, leaving the Rock of Barmuch on
the right hand, and coming within a quarter of a league of the Sea. We saw, as we pass'd by,
within the space of five hundred paces,Sources of Nefte. above thirty sources of Nefte, which is a kind of Medicinal
Oil. There are, among the rest, three great ones, into which they go down by sticks,
plac'd there to serve instead of a Ladder, fifteen or sixteen foot into the ground. A man, standing

above at the pits mouth, might hear the Oil coming out in great bubbles, sending up a
strong smell, though that of the white Nefte be incomparably more pleasant than that of the
black: for there are two sorts of it, but much more of the black, than of the white. We travell'd
that day six leagues, and lodg'd at night, at the Village of Kisicht, not far from the Sea.
                  The third, we got two leagues, and lodg'd at night, at Schabran, having pass'd over three
little Rivers.
                  There lives in the mountains of these parts a certain people,Padars a sort of people. call'd Padar. They live only by
rapine, and course up and down the high-wayes for twenty leagues about, to rob Travellers.
We were told, that, the day before, they came to the Village, to inquite how strong we
were, how we march'd, and what Guard we kept in our quarters.
                  The Mehemandar and the Inhabitants advis'd us to keep a strong Guard, and to keep close
together, as well in our march, as at our quarters. Whence it came, that ever after, we kept
still in sight of the Baggage. The Inhabitants of Schabran are, in their Language, called Kur,
which occasion'd the mistake of diverse of our people in their Journals, who thought they were
the people called Kurdes. But it was a great oversight, in as much as the Kurdes live in Kurdesthan,
which is the ancient Chaldaea, a Province far distant from that we now speak of.
                  Apr. 4. we travell'd four leagues through a hilly, yet very delightful, Country. We overtook
by the way a Caravanne of Muscovian and Circassian Merchants, who were very glad
of our Company, to secure them against the incursions of those Robbers.
                  There appear'd one of them, who would have taken notice of our march, and strength; but
the Mehemandar immediately commanded out ten or twelve Persians, who pursu'd him into
the Wood, where they lost him. He had stoln an Ox, and being forc'd to leave him behind,
the Mehemandar made a Present of him to the Ambassadors.
                  In the afternoon, we came to Mischkar, a Village lying in a fenny place, within two leagues
of Niasabath, where our ship was wrack'd. The Inhabitants of the Village, who took us for
enemies, had left all, and were got into the Woods: but understanding afterwards upon what
accompt we came, they had the confidence to return to their houses. We found in the house
of one of their Priests, many fair Manuscripts.
                  The fifth we travell'd eight leagues, through woody roads. and deserts, to the Village of
Koptepe. We saw by the way the Sepulchre of one of their Saints, named Pyr Schich Molla
Iusuf, and met with a party of five and twenty Horsemen, well mounted and well arm'd. They
said they were Country people of the adjacent Villages, and that they were forc'd to go in
strong parties, and to travel so arm'd, to secure themselves against the Robbers thereabouts:
but they look'd more like such themselves. For we understood afterwards, that the inhabitants
of the Village, where we lodg'd that day, were Padars. Their houses were built upon the
ascent of certain little hills, half within the Earth, being encompass'd about with a knot of
trees, which made a delightful prospect from one house to another.
                  The 6. we travell'd three leagues, all through a continu'd Forest, and we cross'd the three
Rivers of Kossar, Sambur, and Kurgane. That of Sambur is the most considerable, and rises out
of the mountain of Elbours, dividing it self at this place into five branches, the chanels whereof
were so broad, that our horses, as we pass'd through, had not water up to half the
legs.
                  The 7. having gone three leagues,Come to Derbent. we came to the most antient City of Derbent. There came
to meet us only a certain number of Kisilbachs, in regard the Governour, Scahewerdi Sulthan,
between whom and his horse-men there was some difference, durst not come out of the Castle,
lest the Kisilbachs should possess themselves of it.
                  The Persians put this City at 85. degrees longitude,Derbent described. and I found it at forty one degrees, fifty
minutes, latitude. It is in length, reaching from East to West, about a league; and in breadth,
four hundred and fifty ordinary paces.
                  It serves for a Gate to the Kingdom of Persia on that side, for, on one side it reaches to the
foot of the mountain, and on the other, to the Sea, which is so neer, that sometimes the
waves beat over the walls.
                  The Persian Authors, as also the Inhabitants of the City, affirm, that it was built by Iscander,
that is, Alexander the Great; not such as it is now (for that honour is due to their King
Nauschiruan) but only the Castle, and the Wall, which encompasses the City on the South-side.
These walls are very high, and at least five or six foot thick, and viewing them at a distance,
a man would think them built of the best and fairest kind of free-stone; but coming neer
them, he finds that the Stones are made of Muscle-shels, and pieces of free-stone beaten and
molded like Brick, which time hath reduc'd to a hardness beyond that of Marble.
                  I found upon one of the Gates which are remaining of the building of Alexander the Great,
a Syriack Inscription, of three lines, and in another place certain Arabick words, and strange
Characters, but so eaten out by time, that they were not legible. The Castle, where the Chan
lives, is upon the top of the mountain, and kept by a Garrison of five hundred men, who are
of two several Nations, Asumrumlu, and Koidurscha. The second quarter of the City is at the

foot of the mountain, and the most populous; but the lower part of it is very much ruin'd,
since Emir Hamse, the Son of Chadabende, recover'd the City, out of the hands of Mustapha,
the Turkish Emperour, to whom the Inhabitants had voluntarily submitted themselves.
                  The lower part, and that which reaches to the Sea, is about two thousand ordinary paces
in compass; but it lies desert, having no houses, but converted into Gardens and Corn-fields.
It was heretofore inhabited by Greeks, whence the Persians call it, to this day, Scaher Iunan,
that is, the Greek City.
                  All this coast is pure Rock??? upon which score it is very dangerous for Vessels. It serves for a
foundation to the walls of the whole City, which are so broad, that a Wagon may easily be
driven on them. The mountain above the City, is cover'd with wood, where there may be
yet seen the ruins of a wall, above fifty leagues in length, which, as we were told, had sometime
serv'd for a communication between the Caspian and Euxine Seas. In some places it was
some five or six foot high, in other, but two, in others, there was no track of any. There
might be seen also on other hills, the ruins of several old Castles, whereby it might be judg'd,
that they were built four square. There were two undemolish'd, and had garrisons in them.
There are also several redoubts of wood, upon all the avenues.
                  The most remarkable thing about this City is the Sepulchre of Tzumtzume, of whom the
Persians relate this story, after their Poet Fiesuli, who hath left in writing.
                  They affirm,The Fable of Tzumtzume. that Eissi (so they call our Saviour Iesus Christ) coming one day into those
parts, found in his way a dead man's skull, and desirous to know whose it had been, pray'd to
God, with whom he was in great favour, to raise that deceased person to life again, which
God accordingly did, and then Eissi asked him, who he was. He made answer, his name was
Tzumtzume, that he had been King of all that Country, and so powerful, that he consumed
every day in his Court as much salt as forty Camels were able to carry. That he had forty thousand
Cooks, as many Musicians, as any Pages with Pearls in their ears, and as many Sersants.
But says Tzumtzume to Eissi, Who art thou? And what Religion dost thou profess?
Whereto Christ made answer, I am Eissi, and my Religion is that which saves all the World.
If it be so, reply'd Tzumtzume, I am of thy Religion; but I pray thee let me dy assoon as
may be, for, having been heretofore so powrful, it would extremely trouble me to be here
now without a Kingdom and Subjects. Eissi granted his request, and immediately permitted
him to dy; and at this place is his Sepulchre, over which there is a great tree, and, adjoining
to that, there is a Scaffold erected, ten foot high, and sixteen, square.
                  We took notice, on this side of the City, of about five or six thousand Tombs, cover'd
with stones, much larger than the ordinary stature of men, all half round, Cylinder-wise, and
hollow within. They had all of them Arabick Inscriptions, and it is reported, that antiently,
yet since the time of Mahomet, there had been, in Media, a King named Kassan, by birth,
an Okus, (a people living in Thabesseran, behind the mountain of Ebbours) who being ingag'd
in a war against the Tartars of Dagesthan, whom they call Lesgi, was desirous to give them
battel in that place; but that he was there defeated, and that he caus'd the Officers then kill'd
to be buried in the Tombs which are yet to be seen there. Towards the Sea-side, there were
forty others compass'd by a wall, but much bigger than any of the fore-mentioned. These, as
the Inhabitants affirmed, were the Sepulchres of so many great Lords, and holy Persons, who
had been kill'd in the same battel. Every Sepulchre had its Banner.
                  The Persians name these Sepulchres Tziltenan, and the Turks and Tartars, Kerchler. The
Persians and Tartars do their devotions at them, in so much that this place was heretofore very
famous, both for the many foundations, and charities given thereto: but now it is kept by an
antient man, who makes a poor shift to live upon the Alms that are given him.
                  King Kassan, who liv'd many years after this Battel, is interr'd neer Tabris, neer a River,
named Atzi, that is, bitter waters. The Tomb of Queen Burla, his wife, is to be seen neer
the Fortress of Vrumi, and they say it is forty foot long.
                  Apr. 13. we saw several Tartars, as well men as women, coming to do their devotions
there, which consisted in going, one after another, to kiss the Sepulchres of these forty Saints,
upon which they set their hands while they pray'd. It was the tenth day of their Silhatza, on
which they make a commemoration of the sacrifice of Abraham.
                  There are not any Christians at Derbent, but the Inhabitants are all Mussulmans, unless it
be some few Jews, who pretend to be of the Tribe of Benjamin. It is accordingly a place of no
Commerce, save only that the Tartars bring thither a great many stoln Children, or haply
such Turks and Muscovites, as they have taken upon some occasion or other, and there sell
them, to be carried further into the Kingdom.
                  The Soldiers who kept the Garrison there, as also the Citizens, were a proud, daring, and
insolent sort of people, so far from treating us with any civility, that, on the contrary, they
did what they could to pick a quarrel with us.
                  The Mehemandar himself gave us notice before-hand, to stand upon our guard: whence it
came, that, on the 8. after Sermon, the Ambassadors order'd, upon several penalties, that none

of their retinue, should, either in word or deed, give occasion of offence to any Soldier, or Inhabitant,
nor relieve any person whom they should find engag'd in any quarrel with them,
lest they should take occasion, from a particular difference, to fall upon the whole Company.
                  The 9. the Chan of Tarku,The Chan Tarku proffers to convoy the Ambassadors. who had given the Ambassadors a visit, at their former passage
that way, sent us word, that the way we were to travel through the Country of the Tartars of
Dagesthan, was very dangerous, desiring us to make use of the Convoy he proffer'd us. The
Ambassadors, considering that those proffers were made by a Tartar of Dagesthan, and that
there were no more safety in his Company, than among the Robbers themselves, return'd him
their thanks, and sent him word, that they would not put him to that trouble. However we
thought it prudence, to make our advantage of the notice given us of the danger we might fall
into among those Barbarians, and we order'd a view to be made of our Arms, and found, there
were among us, two and fifty Muskets and Firelocks, ninteen cases of Pistols, two brass
Guns, and four murthering-pieces, all well fixt, and fit for service.
                  Having staid some time for Imanculi,They take order for their departure. who had promis'd to follow us within a few dayes, and
finding our selves in a place, where the Governour, instead of supplying us with provisions,
forc'd us to buy all at a dear rate, the Ambassadors resolv'd the 12. to give order for their departure,
commanded the Baggage to be made ready, and deliver'd every man his allowance of
bread for four dayes, in as much as there was no great likelyhood we should find much at the
places we were to travel through.
                  The 13. we were got on horse-back,The Governour hinders it. and ready to march, when word was brought, that
the Governour had shut the City-gate. This news somewhat startled us, and oblig'd the Ambassadors
to send the Mchemandar to him, to know the reason of his so doing. His answer was,
that, having receiv'd intelligence, that Osmin, a Tartar-Prince, not far from Derbent, intended
to set upon us by the way, and put us to an excessive ransome, or take away all we had,
and that being responsable to the King for what might happen to us, he thought it not fit we
should go thence without a Convoy, which being not to be had that day, he desir'd us to stay
till the next.
                  We knew the Convoy he intended us, would serve us in no stead, and that the care he took
proceeded not from any kindness he had for us; but it was fit, we put on the best face we could
upon it. and acknowledg'd our selves oblig'd to him. Only we sent to desire him, in regard we
were all mounted, to permit' us to encamp without the City, and there expect the Convoy.
He was content we should do so; whereupon we went and encamp'd a quarter of a league without
the City, near a Vineyard, upon the side of a small River, which serves for a common
Frontier, between the Tartars of Dagesthan and the Persians.
                  We found near that place the Sepulchres of two other Mahumetan Saints,Other Saints Sepulchres, one, that of Pyr
Muchar, in the plain, at the foot of the mountain; the other, that of Imam Kurchud, within
the mountain. They say the later was of kin to Mahomet, and that he alwayes sate at his feet,
to be instructed by him. They add, that he liv'd three hundred years after Mahomet's death,
and that he retir'd to King Kassan, whom he diverted by his playing on the Lute, and incessantly
animated to make a war against the Lesgi, by the songs he sung to that instrument; but that
at last, presuming to preach to those Barbarians, who were Pagans, in hopes to convert them
to the Mahumetan Religion, they kill'd him.
                  His Sepulchre is in a Cave cut within the Rock. There is also another hollow place in the
same Rock, where there is a Coffin, made of four boards nail'd together, and rais'd about four
foot from the ground. I saw it over-night, and found at it, an old woman, who had the
keeping of the Sepulchre,; but the next day, I found it set forth with a Carpet of Brocado,
and the floor cover'd with Mat, for their convenience who came thither to do their Devotions.
                  There resorted thither many Women and Maids from the City, and other places, who went
all bare-foot into the Cave, kiss'd the Coffin, and, having said their prayers, made their offerings
to the old Woman, to whom they gave some Butter, Cheese, Milk, others, Bread, Mony,
Wax, and the like The night following we heard here a confus'd and dreadful noise, much
like that of persons singing, dancing, and weeping, all at the same time. I never heard any
thing so barbarous.
                  Apr. 14. we expected our Convoy till three hours after Sun-rising;Leave Derbent, but seeing none came,
we set forward, observing the following order.
                  The three Lieutenants, with their Souldiers, having their matches lighted made the Vanguard.
                  Next them, follow'd a Field-piece, of two pound and a half Bullet, upon a carriage with
four wheels, and then the four Murthering-pieces, with all things belonging to them, in a
Wagon.
                  Then marched the Camels, loaden with the baggage, having on both sides some of our retinue,
commanded by the Ambassador Crusius, and in the head of them a Trumpetter.
                  
                     
Next the Baggage, came the other Field-piece, and after that, the Ambassador Brugman,
who brought up the Rear, consisting of all the rest of the Company.
                  In this order we left the Frontiers of Persia, to go into those of the Tartars of Dagesthan.
                  Ptolomy,The Tartars of Dagesthan and his followers, affirm, that this Country is part of that Albania, out of which
Q. Curtius would have to come Thalestiis, Queen of the Amazones, who came to Alexander
the Great in Hyrcania, to get of him that kindness, which Women will not often beg, though
they ever so much desire it. The Persians call these people Lesgi, and they name themselves
Dagesthan Tartar, that is Mountain Tartars, from the word Tag, or Dag, which in their Language,
signifies a Mountain: because they live between the mountains, and in the plain, at
the foot of the mountains, which are twenty or thirty leagues distant from the Caspian Sea, toward
the West.
                  They inhabit all along the Sea-coast, Northward, as far as Terki, about forty leagues, taking
the way we came. The mountain it self, in some places, comes within half a league of
the Sea, and in some it is two or three leagues from it, there being in the plains very fruitful
and pleasant fields, unless it be towards the Sea-side, where it is all heathy and barren.
                  The Inhabitants are of a yellowish and dark complexion, inclining to black; they are well
set and have strong limbs, dreadfully ugly in their faces, and wear their hair, which is black and
greasy, falling down over their shoulders. They are all barbarous and savages.
                  Their cloathing is a long close Coat,Their habit. of a grey or black colour, of a wretched coarse cloath,
over which they wear a Cloak as coarse, or haply of Sheep-skin. On their head they wear a
square Cap, made of several pieces of cloath, and their shooes are of Sheep-skin, or Horse-hide,
all of one piece, and sow'd to their feet over the instep, and at the sides.
                  They are circumcis'd, and have all the other Ceremonies of the Turks, professing the Mahumetan
Religion; but are so slenderly instructed therein, that it is not to be wondred, they
have so little devotion. They live by the Cattel they breed, whereof the Women take care,
while the men go up and down a-robbing, making no conscience to steal away the children of
their nearest relations, to sell them to the Persians and others. Whence it comes, that, even
among themselves, they live in perpetual distrust one of another.
                  Their defensive Arms,Their Arms. which they put on and off, with their Cloaths, are, a Coat of
Mail, a Head-piece, and a Buckler; and the offensive are the Cymitar, Bows and Arrows,
and the Javelin, there being not any so poor among them but is furnish'd with these Arms.
They put all Merchants to a ransome, and sometimes rob them of all; so that the Caravannes
which pass that way, are either so strong as to make their party good against these Tories, or
go by Sea to avoid them.
                  They fear neither Persians nor Muscovites, in regard no Army is able to follow them into
the mountains, into which they retreat when they are pursu'd.
                  All this Country is not subject to one Prince;The Prince of the Tartars. on the contrary, every City, almost hath its
particular Lord. They call him who is the chiefest among them the Schemkal. He succeeds his
Predecessor by an odd way of election. For, upon the death of the Schemkal, the other Lords
or Myrsas meet,How chosen and sit down in a ring, into which the Priest of the place casts a golden Apple,
and the person who is first touch'd thereby is made Schemkal Yet is not his power so absolute,
but that the other Lords participate thereof, they having only for him a certain respect and
compliance, and that not very great.
                  We came into this Country,The Country of Osnun. as we said before on the 14. of April. We travell'd that day
five leagues, passing through several Villages, and pleasant fields, and lodg'd at night in the
Country of Osnun, whom some call Ismin, at a Village named Rustain, which was also the
name of the Lord of it. He sent to meet us his son, attended by fifteen persons on hors-back,
well arm'd, who after the first Complement, fell off on the left hand, and went into a Wood,
and we took the right. We quarter'd in the fields near a Village, fortifying our selves with the
Baggage, and securing our selves against the surprises of those Robbers, by a good number of
Sentinels, plac'd at all the avenues.
                  The young Prince return'd to our Quarters in the evening, but visited only the Muscovian
Ambassador, only to learn of him who we were, and what there was to be gotten of us. We
intended him a Present of 12. Duckats, and three pieces of Persia-Satin, had he honoured the
Ambassadors with a visit; but he thought it enough to do it by two of his Officers, whereupon
we only saluted him with the firing of two great Guns, charg'd with bullets, just at his departure
from the Muscovian Ambassador's to take horse.
                  The 15. we prosecuted our journey, through a hilly Country, and had in our way good
Hunting. There started so many Hares, that, in a short time, we took nine.
                  Having travell'd six leagues that day,The Lordship of Boinack. we came, at night, into the Seigneury of Boinack,
and lodg'd near a Village of the same name, upon the ascent of a hill, which was so steepy towards
the Sea, that we were secure as to that side, and we fortify'd our Camp with the Baggage,
which we drew up like a half-moon well flank'd. The Lord of Boinack hath not many
Subjects, but in recompence, abundance of Cattel, wherein all his Wealth consists.
                  
                     
The Ambassador Brugman was incens'd at the people's looking on us, as a thing they had
never seen before, and would have had some Muskets discharg'd among them, but without bullets,
only to frighten them,Brugman's impertinence. and was enrag'd that those he spoke to would not execute so impertinent
a command, which no doubt had cost us all our lives. For those Barbarians, who
were wicked and daring, and discover'd that they wanted only a pretence to set upon us, grumbled
that any should think it much they stood there, and were confident enough to tell us, that
the ground, they were then upon, was rather theirs, than ours, and that they had as much
right to be there as we had: That we might have forborn threatning them; that they acknowledg'd
we were too strong for them; but that upon the least sign the Schemkal should give them,
they would come with such a force as were able to dispatch us all, though we were twice as
many. That they car'd for neither the King of Persia nor Duke of Muscovy, that they were Dagasthans,
and acknowledg'd no Superiour but God. They would not, at first, suffer us to go
for water, without paying for it; but finding that the Well where it was to be had, was within
the reach of our great Guns, and that we set things in order to force our way to it, they retreated
and left us.
                  The Schemkal sent us word late over-night, that we should not offer to go away the next
morning, till he had search'd our baggage, to see whether we carried any Merchants goods.
The Ambassadors return'd him answer, that they were not Merchants, but Ambassadors, and
that consequently they might pass all places without paying: That they would stand upon their
privilege, and that if the Schemkal offer'd them any violence, they should do what were consonant
to the law of Nature and Nations to prevent it. But we heard no more of him.
                  I heard since,A Polish Ambassador kill'd. that the Polish Ambassador, whom we met in our journey out of Persia, and
of whom I gave some account before, coming to lodge, in his return, at the same place, had
quarrell'd with the Inhabitants of Boinak, and was kill'd with all his retinue, only three Servants
excepted, who got back to Derbent, whence the Mehemandar, who had conducted him
thither, carried them to the Court. During their stay there, the King allow'd each of them
three Abas's a day, till he found a convenience to send them home, which he did afterwards,
upon an Embassy which the Great Duke of Muscovy had sent to him.
                  The 16. we departed betimes in the morning,The Author like to be taken by the Tartars and came, long before night, into the Territories
of the Prince of Tarku, where I narrowly escap'd falling into the hands of those Barbarians.
For, hearing that we were not above a quarter of a league from the Sea-side, I left the
Company, taking along with me the Master's Mate, Cornelius Nicholason, to go and observe
the situation thereof: but we were hardly got thither, ere we discover'd at a distance two Tartars,
follow'd, within two or three hundred paces, by eight more, who, assoon as they perceiv'd
us, made all the haste they could towards us; but we soon recover'd the Road. The two first
seeing us retreat, pursu'd us in full speed, with their Javelins in their hands; till the other
eight, doubting, it seems, that we might not be alone in those parts, got up to a hill, to take
a view of the Country, and seeing all our Company, from which we could not be above a
Musket-shot distant, they call'd to the other two, to give them notice it was in vain to pursue
us. Whereupon, they rode on gently, and came all together to the Company, saluted it,
admir'd our Cloaths, and would needs see our Pistols, but were not permitted to handle
them.
                  We met that day with several parties of Tartars, some appearing before us, some behind us.
Some only pass'd by, others accompany'd us a quarter of a league or better. Some try'd whether
we would suffer them to cross us in our march; but we would not permit it.
                  Having travell'd seven leagues that day,Come to Tarku. we came at night before the City of Tarku, and encamped
without the City, near a Fountain, within a quarter of a league of the Sea.
                  The next day, Apr. 17. the Lord of the place sent his Brother, accompany'd by three persons
of quality, to complement us, and make proffers of his friendship and services.
                  The Chan himself, being sick, could not come in person, which the Ambassadors understanding,
they sent their Physician to him, as well to return their thanks for his civilities, as to offer
his assistance, for the recovery of his health. He made use of him, and found such ease, that
some dayes after, he sent to complement the Ambassadors, and thank them for the care they
had had of him.
                  He was a Lord, of about 38. years of age, named Surchou Chan, and pretended himself descended
from the Kings of Persia, with whom he held so good correspondence, that when the
Dagesthans are ingag'd in a war amongst themselves, he implores the assistance of the Schach,
who fails not to back him. His authority is very considerable among them, yet not so absolute,
but that several Myrsas, of his kindred, participate of the Government. Nay he had a
Nephew, a younger Brother's son, who was Lord of some part of the City.
                  The City of Tarku,Tarku the Metropolis of Dagesthan. the Metropolis of all Dagesthan, lies within the mountain, between
steepy rocks, which are so full of shells, that they seem to consist of nothing else, there being
not the space of a hands breadth, but a man meets with five or six of them, most, about the bigness
of a Wall-nut-shell. The Rock is as hard as flint, yet is there good pasture upon the top of
the mountain.
                  
                     
Out of these Rocks there rise several pleasant springs, which fall into the City several waies.
The City is not wall'd. It may contain a thousand houses, built according to the Persian way,
but not so well. These Tartars, as also those of Boinak, and the others who live more Northerly,
are called Kaitack: but those who live behind Tarku, in the mountain, towards the
West, are named Kamuk, or Kasukumus, who have, most of them, their particular Lords.
                  The Inhabitants of Tarku are as barbarous & mischievous as those of Boinak, but the women
and maids were more civil. They go with their faces uncover'd, and are not kept in such restraint,
as those of the Persians. The maids have their hair ty'd up in forty tresses, which hang
down about their heads, and they were not shy of being seen, nor of having their hair felt.
                  We met here with and old man, named Matthias Magmar, born at Ottingen in the
Dutchy of Wittenberg,A German living among the Tartars. who having left off his trade of weaving, to go into the wars of Hungary,
fell into the hands of the Turks, who had sold him to these Tarters. He was circumcis'd,
and had almost forgot the German tongue; yet he told us he was a Christian, and believ'd one
God and three persons. He also said the Lords Prayer, but with much ado.
                  The proffers of friendship and service which Surchou Chan made us, had rais'd us into some
confidence, that we were safe under his protection: but we found since, that we were in greater
danger there, than we had been any where before. For, during the five weeks we were among
the Tartars, all their discourse was of robbing, rifling, killing, and cutting of throats. We
desir'd the Mehemandar to go along with us to Terki, upon the frontiers of Moscovy, or, at
least, to leave us the Camels and other conveniences for carriage, considering the little likelyhood
we had to get any of the Tartars, and we should requite his kindness with a considerable
sum of mony. But he told us, that he had express order to bring us only to Tarku, and that
if he went any further,The Ambassadors in great danger. it might endanger his life: That we might treat with the Camel-drivers,
and that he would assist us what he could do in it: but instead of obliging us in that, he
took them all along with him that night, unknown to us. This sudden departure of his startled
us the more, in that, the next day, two women, who sold us milk, and pretended to be
Muscovites born, and Christians, and that they had been stoln away in their yourh, & maried
in that Country, came to tell us, that the Tartars intended to kill us all, out of an imagination,
that we carried along with us a vast treasure; That the Inhabitants of Osmin and Boinak had
sent word to Surkou Chan, that we had pass'd through their Country, and that, instead of
paying the duties for our Merchandises and Baggage, we had been so insolent as to threaten them,
and give them ill words: That they had resolv'd to set upon us, to kill all the aged persons,
and make the rest Slaves, and, to that end, had sent Messengers to Surkou Chan, and that there
was one gone from him to the Schemkal.
                  We put the best face outward before those women, and made as if we were not troubled at
any thing the Tartars could do, in regard we knew not how far we should credit their relation.
However we thought good to make our advantage of it, upon this reflection, that we found
no order taken for our departure thence, and that there came thither a party of forty Tartars
of Boinak, & that Messengers pass'd to and fro, as if it were in order to the execution of some
great design.
                  The Ambassadors having call'd together the chief of the retinue, & represented the danger
we were in, put it to the question what were best to be done. It was urg'd, that it had been
more prudence to treat those Barbarians kindly, than to have exasperated them, as had been
done, but since there was no recalling of what was past, that the only way was to take courage,
and ell our lives at the dearest rate we could: That, having, on both sides of us, inaccessible
Rocks, the Sea behind, and the Tartars before us, it would be more honourable for
us to dy nobly, than fall alive into the hands of the Tartars.
                  Our greatest misfortune was, that there were differences among our selves. The Ambassador
Brugman carried on his private designs, and found fault with whatever others advis'd, especially
those among us who any way pretended to Learning. Certain it is, that, instead of contributing
his endeavours to our preservation, he would have contriv'd our ruin, could he have
done it, without danger to himself.
                  We understood since, that it was really the design of the Tartars, to set upon us, and that
they had done it, if the Schemkal, out of hopes to have the whole booty himself, and trapann'd
us an other way, had not prevented them. He sent an Express to tell us, that we should take
our way over the Bridge of Boats, above the City of his ordinary residence, & that if we took
any other, even that of the Sea-side, where we might have cross'd the River by Boat, he should
treat us as Enemies.
                  The Messenger he sent us, having concluded his discourse, rose up, and would have been
gone; but the Muscovian Ambassador taking him by the arm, said to him; Friend, go and
tell thy Schemkal, that he is not to appoint us our way; we shall take that we think fit:
'tis true, it well be no hard matter for him, to cut off a handful of people; but let him know,
that the Czaar, who is most concern'd in this Embassy, will resent it, and revenge our
deaths, with the greatest cruelty imaginable. This sharp and resolute answer made the Tartars

quit the design they had to set upon us, as they intended, and oblig'd them to change their
manner of proceeding: So that, Apr. 20. we were visited by four Tartar-Princes, who din'd
with the Ambassadors in their Tent, and were not ill treated, considering the place we were
then at. All their discourse was only of robbing and stealing, and selling men: nay one of them
said that, all the week before, he had stoln but one poor Girl. After they were gone, the
Prince of Osmin's Brother came to visit us. He express'd somewhat of civility, and made us
great proffers of his services. After him, came the Daruga of the City of Tarku. We ask'd
him, why we were not furnish'd with conveniences of carriadge for our Baggage. He ingenuously
told us,A Present sent to Surkou-Chan. that we were not to expect any, till we had made a Present to Surkou Chan.
The next day, there was one sent him, to wit, a pair of gold Bracelers, a pound of Tabacco,
a Pistol, a Firelock, a barel of Powder, two pieces of Persia-Satin, and several sorts of Spices,
with this message withall, that a barel of Aquavitae should be sent him, as soon as we came to
Terki. This Present took him so, as that he prefently promis'd we should have all conveniences,
for mony,Who invites them to dinner. and invited the Ambassadors to come and dine with him. It was taken into consideration
whether they should go, or not; but at last, it was resolv'd they should, taking along
with them four other persons.
                  The cloath was laid upon the ground, according to the Persian way, and the whole entertainment
consisted in four dishes,Particulars of the entertainment. wherein there were little slices of Mutton, drawn upon sticks,
some Whitings, and Curds, and in four other lesser dishes, Rice, with pieces of Mutton in
it, and raisins of the Sun. The Carver sate in the middle of the dishes, and having broke a long
thin Cake, he cast a piece of it to every one of the Guests. He also tore the pieces of Meat
and the Fish, but all was done only by his hands, which were as black as his face; so that the
fat running between his fingers, and mingling with the dirt from which it took another colour,
almost turn'd our stomacks.
                  But there was a necessity we should comply. Our drink was only water, in great glasses, and
afterwards Aquavitae, in silver Cups. After dinner, they would needs hear our Musick, which
we sent for; and after a divertisement of three hours, there was meat brought in again. I observ'd,
among other things, the Liver and Rump of a Sheep, which was all fat, and weigh'd
at least five or six pound.
                  One of the Carvers, (for at this second treatment there were three) minc'd the meat very small,
salted it well, and serv'd every man by handfuls. The meat look'd as if it had been chew'd
before, yet was it not so bad, as against our stomacks. After the treatment, we return'd to
our Quarters.
                  The next day,Another Tartaria Feast. Apr. 21. one of the other Princes, named Iman Myrsa, invited the Ambassadors
to dinner. He was very young, as being not full eighteen years of age, and born between
a Brother of Surkou Chan's, and a woman, by birth a Kasamuka. His Servant told us,
that Surkou Chan usurp'd the Principality from him, and that his life was in some danger, by
reason of his Uncle.
                  The cloath was laid in a great Hall, where we sate down, with Imam Myrsa, and some
other Lords of the Country, in Chairs, at a low Table. We were better treated, than we
had been the day before, and the Meat was better drest. Among other dishes there was brought
in a whole Lamb roasted, whereof every one carv'd himself what he pleas'd. They used no
knives but tore the Meat in pieces, and I observ'd that when one had left any Meat about the
bone, his next neighbour took it up, and pick'd it, and many times it went to a third and
fourth hand, till at last, he who could find nothing about it would try what there was within,
and get out the marrow.
                  Their drinking Vessels are of Cows-horns, and their drink a sort of liquor called Bragga,
which they make of Millet, and, in colour and consistence, looks like the lees of beet. They
think it very delicious, and drink freely of it, as they do also of Aquavitae, and grow of a
sudden so drunk, that notwithstanding the presence of their Pince, they made such a noise, as
would have drown'd Thunder it self.
                  The Tartars having thus treated us, we took leave of them, well satisfy'd with the cheer
they made us.
                  Some daies after, the Ambassadors were treated by another Prince, named Emir-Chan,
who also gave them a visit. But all these Barbarians did in this kind, was only to get Presents
from us.
                  The 23. the Daruga got us some Waggons for the Baggage. We immediately loaded them,
intending to be gone the next day: but in the evening, Surchou-Chan sent us word, that he had
certain intelligence, that Sultan Mahmud (so was the Schemkal call'd) had possess'd himself of
all the passages of the River Koisu, with a design to stop us, and put us to a ransom, and that
hindred him from permitting us to depart.
                  Late in the evening, there came neer Tarku twenty horse-men, well mounted aud arm'd, who
encamped close by our Quarters. The Ambassadors, accompany'd by some Musketteers, went
to them, to know whence they came, and what their design was. They made answer, that

the Prince of Osmin had sent them to the Schemkal, to tell him that certain forein Ambassadors,
friends of the King of Persia, and Czaar of Muscovy, being come into his Territories, he had
suffered them to poss without paying any toll or duties, and to intreat him, to do him the same
favour; which the Schemkal had promis'd to do, provided they carried no Merchants goods.
We gave not so much credit to this intelligence, as to neglect keeping a strong Guard, and having
our Arms in readiness.
                  The 24. these Tartars departed before day, and presently after, there came to us, two
Messengers from Sulthan Mahmud, who asked the Ambassadors why they did not prosecute
their journey, promising all the favour and assistance lay in his power, for their passage, provided
they took the way he appointed them. These Messengers were hardly gone, ere Surkou-Chan
came to visit us. The Ambassadors asked him, why he hindred their departure, he told
them, that the Horses and Oxen, we had hired, were ready, and that we might be gone when
we pleas'd, giving it him under our hands, how that we would needs depart, notwithstanding
the notice he had given us of the designs of the Schemkal, in as much as otherwise he should be
responsible to the King of Persia, and Great Duke of Muscovy, for the misfortunes might
happen to us: That he knew the Schemkal better than we did: That he car'd for neither God,
nor Devil, nor any forein Prince at all: That he never observ'd his word: That it was his only
sport, to rob, and shed blood, and that it were better stay eight dayes longer, within which
time he promis'd us a sufficient Convoy, without which we could not pass through the Prince's
Country, if we resolv'd not to hazard our lives, and lose our Baggage: That ere that time
were expir'd, the Persian Ambassador would come thither, with Letters of Commendation
from the King, without which he durst not undertake to convoy us, left he should thereby disoblige
all the other Tartars.
                  This discourse put us into a great perplexity, considering that the arrival of the Persian Ambassador
was uncertain,The Governour of Terki refuses a Convoy. and that in the mean time, we mght fear the same thing from Surchou-Chan,
which he would have us apprehend from the Schemkal. We sent an Express to the Weywode
of Terki, to desire him to send us a Convoy of Strelits, such as might secure us against the
attempts of the Tartars; but he would do nothing. Surchou-Chan sent an Express to Derbent,
to know of the Ambassador, how long it would be ere he came to Tarku: but he sent us word,
some dayes after, that the man he had dispatch'd for Derbent was return'd, but had been so indiscreet
as to put the Letter, deliver'd him by Imancnla Sulthan, into his Quiver, and going to
shoot at a beast by the way, had dropp'd it, so that he had been forc'd to send him back again.
All these proceedings added more and more to our jealousie; but what most startled us, was,
the sudden departure of certain Armenian Merchants, who having joyn'd with us, out of hopes
of travelling with greater safety in our Company, went into the City, upon notice given them,
that two hundred Tartars intended to set upon us. Besides, the inconveniences we endur'd by
reason of ill weather heightned our affliction: for the continual rains had not only sunk through
our Tents and Cloaths, but also hindred us from making any fire, to warm us, and dress our
Meat. No condition, for misery, could be compar'd to that we were then in, forsaken by all,
destitute of all things, even advice and resolution, insomuch that we durst not go into the Tartars
hutts, Surkou Chan himself having given us notice, that we might run the hazard of being
carried away and sold. Nay, Apr. 27. one of our Soldiers, a Scotchman, named William Hoye,
being got a little too far from the Quarters, was carried away by the Tartars, so clearly, that
we could never learn any news of him, though we made great inquiry. We heard since, that
he was carried to the Fortress of Sachur, within five or six leagues of Turku.
                  The same day, there hapned to us another misfortune, in that, some of our people being shooting
with Bows and Arrows, our Canonier, going somewhat near the Mark, to take up an Arrow,
was shot into the Belly, whereof he died the next day.
                  The Muscovite, whose mishap it was to hurt him, had so sensible a remorse of what had
happened, that he desired to be put to death, but the business being taken into consideration, it
was found done by chance without any design; whereupon he was set at liberty. We interr'd
the deceas'd, by the advice of certain Tartar-women who were Christians, in the place where
our horses stood, and made a Grave without the Quarters, into which was put an empty Coffin,
it being certain that the Tartars would, after our departure thence, dig up the Carcass, to give
in their Dogs. There died also a rich Muscovian Merchant. His body was inbalm'd, and
brought to Terki, where it was buried, in the Church-yard, belonging to those of his Religion.
Amidst all these afflictions and misfortunes, the Tartars came every day to get our Musick plaid
upon; which was somewhat like that of the Israelites, at the waters of Babylon.
                  May 1. we dispatch'd a man to Sulthan Mahmud,MAY. to desire passage. Our Messenger return'd
the next day,The Schemkal grants them passage. accompany'd by four Tartars, who told us from the Schemkal, that he wondred
much to hear, that Surchou-Chan would perswade them, he was a famous Robber and faithless
person: that he had given him no cause to dress him in such a Character, and that he should
take occasion to resent it. For us, he proffer'd all his Credit, and his Subjects, for the advancement
and safety of our journey; and that if we durst not trust him, he was ready to send

us three of the principal Lords of the Country as hostages, whom we should either take along
with us, or leave with Surchou-Chan, till we were out of his Jurisdiction.
                  These unexpected proffers put us to some difficulty what we should do: but hearing, that
Sulthan Mahmud liv'd otherwise than his Father had done, who, having dishonour'd his Country
by continual robberies, had reform'd his life, and, to expiate his sins, went on pilgrimage
to Meca, and to Mahomet's Sepulchre, we accepted of his proffers; and that the more willingly,
in that the 6. following, we receiv'd Letters from Derbent, wherein the Persian Ambassador
sent us word, that being oblig'd to continue there till he had receiv'd his dispatches and
the Interpreter he expected from the Court, and thinking it would be a moneth longer ere he
came to Tarku, he left it to our choice, whether we would expect him, or prosecute our journey.
Upon this, we press'd Surchou-Chan, to give order for our departure; which he did, after
the receipt of another Present, which he had the boldness to beg himself, and security given, for
the return of the Horses and Oxen, which carried our Baggage, by two of the Schemkal's hostages,
whom we left with him, taking the third along with us.
                  May 12. we left Tarku, upon the dangerous word of Sulthan Mahmud. We had agreed 15.
dayes before with the Waggoners of Tarku: but when the Baggage came to be loaden, they fell
from the former agreement, and made us pay much more than we had promis'd them. They
would have done the same for the Saddle-Naggs; but the Ambassadors would not condescend:
which occasion'd some of our people, nay of the chiefest, to foot it, the two first dayes, not
without abuses and jeers from their enemies.
                  We travell'd that day two leagues, through a plain and even Country, but desert, to a Rivulet
which serves for a common Frontier, between Sulthan Mahmud, and the Prince of Tarku,
We met by the way certain Tartar Lords, who intreated the Ambassadors to lend them our
Physician, to visit one of their friends, who was sick not far thence. The Physician seeming
unwilling to go, out of a fear he should never return, they left two of their Company, as hostages,
with us, and brought him back after mid-night. All our Supper that night was, only
Bread and troubled Water.
                  May 13. being Whitsunday, we travell'd four leagues, through a very woody Country.
We thought that day; we should have been left by the way; for the Muscovian Ambassador
having cudgell'd one of the Waggoners, all the rest would unteam, and return homewards:
but with much intreaty and fair words we got them to stay. We pass'd over the night in the
Wood, and those who were desirous to sleep, lay down supperless.
                  The 14. we got but one league,The River Albanus. to the River Koisu, which, in my opinion must be that which
Ptolomy calls Albanus. It rises out of mount Caucasus. Its Water is thick and troubled, and its
course very swift. It is at least as broad as the Elbe, & in that place, it was above twenty foot deep.
                  The Town or Village of Andre, where Sulthan Mahmud liv'd, stands upon a hill, on this
side of the River. Near the Village, there is a Spring of seething Water, which falls into a
Pool, and makes the water thereof very fit for bathing. The Inhabitants of it are for the most part
Fisher-men, and we saw them in great numbers upon the River-side, about their employment.
                  They thrust a sharp hook baited, which is fasten'd to a long pole, to the bottom of the River,
and by that means take abundance of Sturgeons, and such like fish.
                  I heard they had an odd custom at their Weddings, which is, that all the men bidden thereto
shoot each of them an Arrow into the floor, and leav them there, till they either rot, or fall
of themselves, whereof I could never learn any reason.
                  As soon as they perceiv'd us, they came to the River-side; and proffer'd to help us over, and
to facilitate the getting over of the Baggage, they joyn'd two Boats together, over which they
laid a hurdle, strong enough to bear a Wagon. They demanded two Crowns for the passage of
every Wagon, and we had about seventy; and perceiving we made some difficulty to give it
them, and that we chose rather to make a bargain with them for all together, they pass'd over
to the other side, where they fell a jeering and laughing at us. We saw there also the Schemkal,
standing at the entrance of the Wood, accompany'd by a great number of persons on hors-back:
so that we knew not what case we were in.
                  We made hurts of boughs of Trees, upon the River side, and had several private Assemblies,
in regard there was not any publick, in relation to the holy time of Whitsuntide. Such as profess'd
Letters met at the Ambassador Crusius's, where we dined, having no other drink than
Oxicrat, that is, a beveridge of Vinegar and Water, which was increas'd by the tears we shed,
reflecting on the difference there was, between our present condition, and that we should be in
at our return into our dear Country.
                  The 15. we intreated the Muscovian Ambassador to cross the River, which he did, and spoke
to the Schemkal, according to the instructions we had given him, and prevail'd so far, that the
Tartars were content to take two Tumains, which amount not to above forty Crowns, for the
passage of all the Company and the Baggage.
                  VVe cross'd the River the same day, and the Ambassadors immediately caus'd their Tents to
be pitch'd, and fortify'd the Quarter with the Baggage, which was defended by the Artillery.
                  
                     
Soon after the Schemkal, accompany'd by two of his Brethren, and a retinue of 50. persons
on horse-back, gave them the first visit. He was about 36. years of age, strong, bulky, and of
a good countenance. He had on a Garment of green Satin, over a Coat of mail, and over that
a Cloak, of extreme coarse cloath. His Arms, as also those of the rest of the Company, were
the Cymitar, Bows, and Arrows. Besides a Present of certain Sheep and Lambs, he caus'd
some of his people, to bring thither a great Chauldron, full of Sturgeon, cut into little pieces, and
boil'd in water and Salt, whereto there was a sawce of fresh Butter and Sorrel. I may truly
say, I never made a better meal, and that all the delicates of Persia were not comparable to
that dish. The Ambassadors treated him with Aquavitae and Musick, during which our brass
Guns were several times discharg'd. He diverted himself in that manner for the space of two
hours, till that being got half drunk, he withdrew; but return'd again within a white after.
                  We presented him with a pair of gold Bracelets, a silver Goblet, a Scarlet Cloak, lin'd with
Furr, a case of Pistols, a Sword, a barrel of Powder, certain Persia silk stuffs, and some Goats-skins
dress'd into leather. He immediately put on the Cloak, and gave his own to the Ambassador
Brugman, who had the prudence to humour him, and assure himself of his kindness and
friendship, by putting him in hopes of extraordinary advantages, likely to accrue to him by
settlement of the Commerce, for which he had travell'd so far. He told him, that the Persian
Ambassador was to follow them, to conclude with the Duke of Holstein, what they had but
begun in Persia; that the said Ambassador would give him further satisfaction as to that particular,
and that they should be oblig'd to pass through his Country once a year, with Commodities
of great value: That that Country was not known at all in Germany, and that their
Prince knew not they were, in those parts, to meet with so great a Lord, otherwise, he had
sent him very considerable Presents; but that it should not be omitted hereafter, and that it
was their intention to make a perpetual friendship with him. This discourse so pleas'd the
Schemkal, that he would have hasten'd our departure thence, that we might the sooner return
that way. So that we had horses for the sadle and for carriage at a very easie rate, to carry us
as far as Terki.
                  May 16.Leave we departed. He himself, accompany'd by fifty horse, convoy'd us through a
thick Wood, half a league from Andre,Andre. where he took leave of us, with much civility. We travell'd
that day two leagues, over a great Plain, to the River Aksai. It runs very slowly in
those parts, and is not above fifty paces broad. The Tartars told us, that it is an arm of the
River Koisu, into which it falls, near the Sea. There we were forc'd to stay for the Boats, and
the Hurdles, which the Inhabitants of Andre brought in Waggons, and in the mean time, we
cut Reeds and Canes, to lay over the mudd which hindred our coming dry to the River side.
We cross'd it by Moon-light, and paid there also two Tumains for our passage.
                  Such as were not in favour with the Ambassador Brugman, were forc'd to lye down supperless.
                  The 17. we travell'd seven leagues, over a great Heath, where we began to be out of sight
of mount Caucasus.
                  We came at night to the River Bustro, and pitch'd our Tents in the adjoyning Forest. This
River is very muddy, and near as big, but not so swift as that of Koisu. Running Northward,
about five leagues from the Caspian Sea, it is divided into two branches, whereof one, heretofore
named Terk, and now Timenki, hath erived its name to the City of Terki, by which it
passes, and is about fifty foot broad.
                  The other branch of the said River is called Kisilar, by reason of certain Grains, like Gold,
which come down with its gravel, and the Chanel of it is as broad as that of the other, but hath
so little water, that many times, in the Summer, a man may cross it dry-foot. The mouth of
this arm is eight leagues above the City of Terki.
                  It is to be observ'd here, that all these Rivers come from the West-north-west, and that between
Kisilar and the River Wolga, which are sixty five leagues distant one from the other,
there is no other River. So that we are to conclude, that the Aksai, is the Coesius of Ptolomy;
that Bustro, is the Gerrus; that Timenki, or Terk, is the Alonta, and that Kisilar is the Adonta,
in as much as there are only these Rivers between the Albanus or Koisu, and the Rha, or
Wolga.
                  The River Bustro is a common Frontier between the Tartars of Dagesthan, and those of Circassia;
upon which accompt it was, that the Waggoners of Tarku, would not go beyond it.
                  May 18.Enter Circassia. we cross'd the River, and got over the Baggage, to our greater satisfaction in this
particular, that we left, on the other side of the River, the Mahumetans and Pagans, and were
entred into Christendom. For though the Tartars of these parts are also Pagans or Maumetans,
as well as those of Dagesthan, and the rest, yet are they under the Jurisdiction of a Christian
Prince, who is the Great Duke of Muscovy, and hath, at all places, his Governours, Magistrates
and Priests, for the exercise of Christian Religion.
                  Provisions were so dear in these parts, that we were forc'd to pay above thirty shillings for a
Sheep. Nay they would not spare us many; so that to get flesh, we went into the Woods and
shot at Crows, whereof there were abundance thereabouts.
                  
                     
The 19. we travell'd five leagues, through a plain Country, full of Reeds, having also
some few trees, which were, for the most part, planted round about a great Plain.
                  At night we encamped upon the Heath, neer a Well, or rather a Sink, in regard the water
of it was so corrupt, that the very Beasts would not drink of it. The ground thereabouts was
all full of holes, which the Serpents and Snakes had made there; and yet, though we were
forc'd to lodge on the ground, not one of us receiv'd any harm.
                  The 20. we got four leagues further, over heathy and barren Lands, to the City of Terki.
We saw that day a great many Serpents, many whereof where as big as a man's arm, and above
six foot in length. They lay round, and sported themselves in the heat of the Sun, which
gave a delightful lustre to the liveliness of the colours, wherewith their skins were spotted all
over. We saw also, neer Terki, a kind of Field-mice,Abundance of Serpent. Jerbuah, a kind of Field-Mouse??? which, in the Arabian Language, are
called Ierbuah. They are about the bigness of a Squirrel, and somewhat like the Creature of
that kind which is so common in Europe, save that their hair is blacker, their heads like those
of Rats, they have long ears, the fore-feet short, and the hinder feet long; whence it comes,
that they cannot run, but when they get up some place, and, in the plain, they only creep,
unless it be, when thy leap, for then they spring five or six foot high from the ground, having
their tails layd over their backs. And whereas their tails are long, and without any hair, like
those of ordinary Mice, but not so big, they are somewhat like the Lions Rampant, in Coats
of Arms: and they made a pretty kind of sport, especially when many of them leap'd at the
same time, as we said before. They say, there are abundance of them about Babylon, and in
Arabia, where the Inhabitants eat them. Some will leave the field, and go into peoples houses;
which if they do, the master of the house had need have a care of his money, left they light
upon it.
                  The Persian, whom I brought out of the Country, and who still waits on me, named Achwordi,
told me a story, how that his Father having observ'd that his mony was, from time
time, taken out of his Chamber, at first suspected his Wife and Children, till, one day finding
there one of these Ierbuah, he presently imagin'd who playd the Thief: but to be assur'd of it,
he set an Abas upon the Table, and, going out of the room, lock'd the door, so that no
other could get in, and coming thither a while after, the Abas was gone, whereupon searching
the nest of that Creature, he found in it more mony than he had lost.
                  Within a quarter of a league of the City of Terki, came up to us a Brother of Prince Mussal's,
of whom we have spoken heretofore, accompany'd by a Colonel, whom the Weywode
sent to meet and complement us. He receiv'd us in Tents, pitch'd without the City, where
we had a Collation of Ginger-bread, Beer, Hydromel, and Aquavitae. During our stay there,
there were Lodgings taken up for us in the City.
                  The next day, the Weywode sent the Ambassadors four dishes of Meat, for their wellcom
thither. The Ambassadors sent to visit the Princess Bika, Mussal's Mother, and, some dayes
after, went to her in person. They din'd with her. Now was our joy compleat, to find our
selves out of the power of the Tartars of Dagesthan, and among the Moscovites, who were
our friends and acquaintance, which made us send for our Musick to divert our selves at Prince
Mussal's.
                  We promis'd, in the precedent part of this Relation, to give a further account of the Circassian
Tartars, in our return, in as much as, travelling by Sea, as we went, we could not
learn much of them??? There is no Historian, either antient or modern, that I know of, who
speaks of them. Scaliger makes mention of them, in his Exercitations, against Cardan, Exerc.
33. 167. & 303. sect. 3. but in very few words, and, with Strabo, calls them Zigi, placing
them beyond the Caucasus, upon the Euxine Sea, and towards the Palus Meotides, upon the
Frontiers of Asia and Europe: whereas they, whom we saw, are Scythians, or Caspian Sarmatians,
and possess'd of part of the antient Albania, which hath for his Frontiers, on the East
and West side, the Caspian Sea, and mount Caucasus; and on the South and North, the River
Bustro, and the dreadful Deserts of Tartary and Astrachan.
                  Their Metropolis is Terki;Terki the Metropolis of Circassia. but ever since the reduction of those parts by the Great Duke,
he hath put Garrisons into all the Cities, leaving the Circassian Tartars, for their habitations,
but only open Towns and Villages, though under the Government of the Lords of the Country,The Government of the Country.
who are all subject to the Czaar, and oblig'd to take an Oath of Allegiance to him. The
administration of Justice, whereof those of their Nation have the management, passes under
the Czaar's name, and in the presence of the Weywode, especially if the affairs be of importance.
Their houses are but poor ones, built, for the most part, of earth and boughs of
trees, and within, plaister'd over with Clay.
                  The men, for the most part, are strong, and of yellowish complexion, but not so broad-fac'd
as those of Nagaia. Their hair is black and long, save that they shave the midst of their
heads, from there fore-head to the neck, about the breadth of an inch, leaving at the crown
a little lock, which falls down behind.
                  Scaliger saies, that the Circassian Tartars are the most perfidious, and most barbarous of

any Nation. It might be more truly said of those of Dagestan. For the Circassians are somewhat
less barbarous, and more compliant. 'Tis likely, that since their coming under the Jurisdiction
of the Muscovites, and their conversing with Christians. they, by degrees, quit their
former barbarism.
                  They have their Language common with all the other Tartars,Their language Habit. and besides that, most of
them speak also the Muscovian. The men are cloath'd as the other Tartars, save that their
Caps are a little larger, and much like those of our Priests. Their Cloaks are of a very coarse
cloath, or Sheep-skin, fasten'd at the neck with a point or string; but both sides do not come
together, so that, it being able to cover only some part of the body, they turn it, before
or behind, according to the Wind and Rain.
                  Their Women are well shap'd, and have good faces, a clear and smooth complexion, and
their cheeks well colour'd. Their hair, which is black, hangs down in two tresses, o both
sides of their faces, which are never cover'd. They wear about their heads a black Coif, cover'd
with a piece of very fine Cotton, or some other wrought linnen cloath, which they ty
under they chin.
                  The Widdows have hanging behind in their necks an Ox bladder,Women fully blown, cover'd
with a piece of Cotton, Lawn, or some other stuff of several colours, so that at a distance,
they seem to have two heads. The Women, in Summer wear only a smock, which is red,
green, yellow, or blew, cut so deep before, that a man may see all down to their Navels.
                  They were very familiar, and of a very good humour. The first day after ou arrival, four
of them came to us, in a stately gate, aud with such a confidence, as the Poets attribnte to
the Amazons, whom they place in or neer these parts. They stai'd us, and would not let us
go, till they had taken particular notice of all things about us. Nor were they on the other side
so shy, as to take it ill, that some of ours, who pretended to handle the beads of amber and
shells, or necklaces of Tinn or Copper, which they wear about their necks, slipp'd their hands
down into their bosoms. Some invited us to their houses, and we were told, it was the custom
of the Country, that the husband, seeing any one going to his house, to speak with his wife,
should, to avoid being troublesome, go out of doors, and leave them together. Though the
men are seldome at home, as being all day busied in the fields, about their Cattel, yet do they
relate miracles of the chastity of these women.
                  One I have to this purpose from a Military Officer of ours,Are Chaste. who being got into one of their
houses; and finding the woman handsome, grew familiar with her, and found her very willing
to do him any little kindness that lay in her power, even to make him Handkerchers, & wash
his head: so that, thinking the fort as good as taken, he would try how much longer she could
stand out. But she told him there was no such thing done among them; that the confidence
their husbands had of their honesty, requir'd they should be as faithful on their parts; nay that
though their husbands might connive at such a miscarriadge, yet would not the rest of the people
pass by an inconstancy of that nature. They made no difficulty to endure any thing else, and
would be paid for it, taking and begging Presents, nay under pretence of visiting our cloaths
all about, they sometimes put their hands into our pockets, and took out what they could
light on.
                  Though it be lawful among them, for men to marry several wives, yet most content themselves
with one. When a man dies without issue, his Brother is oblig'd to marry the widdow,
to raise up seed to him; and according to this custom, the Mussal had married his Brothers
widdow.
                  Their Religion is in a manner Pagan;Their Religion. for though they are circumcis'd, yet have they neither
Bible, nor Alchoran, nor Priests, nor Churches. They are themselves the Priests, and offer
the Sacrifices, especially on the day of St. Elias.
                  When a person of quality dies the relations and friends meet in the fields,Their Sacrifices. both men and women,
to sacrifize a he-Goat; and to find whether it be fit to sacrifize, they cut off the privy
members, which they cast against the wall: if they do not stick thereto, they are oblig'd to
kill another, but if they do, they proceed with the Ceremonies, fleaing it, and stretching the
skin upon the top of a long pole, before which they offer their sacrifice, and boil, and roast the
Flesh, which they afterwards eat. The Feast ended, the men rise, and go and adore the skin, and
the prayers concluded, the women withdraw. The men stay, and grow so bestially drunk, with
their Bragga, or Aquavitae, that they seldom part without fighting. This skin is left upon the
pole, till another person of quality dies, and then the former is taken away, and another set up
instead of it.
                  We saw neer Terki, both going and coming, not far from the Princess Bika's house, one
of these stretch'd skins, with the head and the horns on, upon the black cross. The pole was
planted in a quick-set hedge, only to keep the Dogs from coming neer it, and, by their pissing
against it, profaning the Mystery.
                  They interr their dead very honourably;Their enterments. adorn their Sepulchres with pillars, and build houses
over those of persons of quality. We saw one over the Sepulchre of Mussal's Brother, the

boards whereof were of diverse colours, plac'd checquerwise, having, upon the roof, several
wooden Statues, poorly done, which represented the hunting of some wild Beast.
                  To express their sorrow for the departure of their friends, they tear their forehead, arms,
and breasts, with their nails, after a barbarous manner, so that the blood comes out in abundance.
Their mourning continues till the wounds are healed, and if they would have it last longer,
they renew, them, by opening the scratches in the same manner.
                  May. 21. we began to set things in order, for the prosecution of our journey. We had a
Desert of seventy leagues to travel over, and, to find horses for all the Company to ride, would
have been too great an expence. Wherefore we agreed with the Waggoners of Terki, at nine
Crowns a Wagon, drawn by two horses, which might carry each of them three or four persons,
to Astrachan.
                  There joyned with us a Caravan of Merchants, of several Nations, as Persians, Turks,
Greeks, Armenians, and Muscovites; so that then we had above two hundred Wagons,
in our Company. But the Provisions allow'd us were but small for so great a journey: to wit,
to every man, with the Suchari, and a loaf of mouldy brown bread, half a dry'd Salmon that
stunk, without any drink. For the Tartars, pretending they had bargain'd only for the cariadge
of men, would not receive any barrels or other vessels into the Wagons, and the Ambassador
Brugman would not be at the charge of a Wagon, purposely to carry beer or water
for us, though he made good provision of all for himself and his Favourites. And indeed we
stood not much upon it, out of an imagination, it was impossible, we should want water: but
we had time enough to repent us of that presumption.
                  We left Terki, the fourth of Iune,JUNE??? in the afternoon, and soon entred into that dreadful
Heath,The Ambass. leave Terki. taking our way on the left hand, and turning from the Caspian Sea. 'Tis a thing strange,
yet very certain, that, in eleven daies journey, we saw neither City, nor Village, nor tree,
nor hill, nor any River but that of Kisilar, contrary to what all Maps represent thereof.The Deserts of Astrachan. Nay,
during all that time, we saw not so much as one Bird, but only a vast Plain, desert, sandy,
and cover'd in some places with a little grass, and pits, or standing pooles, of salt, or corrupt
and stinking water. We got the first day but two leagues, and lodg'd at night, neer one of
those standing pools.
                  The 5. we encamped neer the River Kisilar.
                  The 6. we travell'd six leagues, and lodg'd neer one of those pools. These three first daies,
we took our way towards the West-north-west, and East-north-east, to the River Wolga.
                  The 7. we got six leagues further, through a great Fenn, which we had much ado to pass.
Heat and thirst troubled us extremely, but not so much as the Flies, Wasps, Gnats, and other
infects, which both men and horses found it no small difficulty to keep off. The Camels,
which have no tails, to keep away those infects, as the horses have, were all bloody, and full
of swellings.
                  The 8. we were going before day; and having travell'd 4. leagues, we gave our horses a
little rest and provender, at the entrance of a very sandy road. In the afternoon, we got four
leagues further, and lodg'd at night, neer a standing pool. The Tartars perceiving that one of
their horses was like to miscarry by the way, prevented him, cut his throat, and shar'd him
among themselves. At night they roasted him, making a fire of little bushes of thorns and reeds,
and were very merry.
                  The 9. we travell'd seven leagues, and lodg'd, neer a pool which the overflowing of the Sea
made thereabouts. The water was so bad, as was also that of all the rest, that we were forc'd
to stop our noses while we drunk it.
                  The 10. we got seven leagues further, to a place cover'd with Reeds, where we found a little
fresh water, deriv'd thither from the Wolga.
                  The 11. we got seven leagues further, to a standing pool, made there by the inundation of
the Wolga. The water is not salt, but so dead and stinking, that there was no drinking of it.
That day, twelve great wild Boars cross'd out way. Some Tartars on horse-back came riding
after them, and as ill fortune would have it, there came two of them close by our Waggon.
The horses were frightned, and fell a-running, so that the Physician and Steward fell out of
the Waggon, with the Baggage. The Siur Vchterits and my self, who sate in the fore-part of
the Waggon, considering there was no getting out without danger, kept our places, till the
horses, being not able to go any further, stopp'd at the entrance of a Fenn.
                  The 12. we travell'd eight leagues, and found, in our way, upon the ground, a Neast,
wherein there were two Birds not quite fledg'd Some were of opinion they were young Eagles.
VVe pass'd by two salt marshes, the scent whereof was somewhat like that of a Violet, and
very delightful.
                  The 13. we travell'd eight leagues further, lodg'd at night in a place, whence we could discover
the City of Astrachan.
                  The 14. we got three leagues, and lodg'd on the side of the Wolga, over against Astrachan.
All our people who had not drunk any fresh water, since their coming from Terki, ran up to

their knees in the River, to drink with greater ease. Assoon as they had notice at Astrachan of
our arrival, they presently came to visit us, and he who had the keeping of the Provisions sent
thither for us, brought us a sack full of bread, Neats-tongues, hung-Beef, a tun of Beer, and
a barrel of Aquavitae. We continu'd that day on the River-side, to give the Weywode time to
assign us Lodgings.
                  The next day,Come to Astrachan. Iune 14. we cross'd the River Wolga, and were lodg'd in a great Ambara, or
Store-house, built there not long before, upon the River side, without the City, where we
were much troubled with Flies. We found there also another Store-house, full of Provisions,
which David Ruts, his Highness's Factor at Moscou, had sent thither six months
before.
                  The Ambassador Brugman would have had all the Baggage dispos'd into an appartment by it
self, intending to have it search'd, and to that purpose, had open'd some Chests: but those of
the retinue who had not put off either cloaths or linnen, since their departure from Terki, were
so incens'd at this procedure, that they broke into the Room, and carried away their Chests,
notwithstanding the order he had given the Sentinel, plac'd at the door, to keep any from
getting in.
                  Iune the last, the Ambassadors sent their Presents to the Weywode, who return'd them another
Present, of four Sheep, an Ox, ten wild Ducks, ten Pullets, six Geese, a runn of Beer,
and another of Hydromel.
                  'Tis true,JULY. the Ambassadors dined and supp'd together, during our aboad at Astrachan; but
there was not a word spoken at Table, unless it were when the Ambassador Brugman was pleas'd
to fall on any with his ordinary Language which was picquant and satyrical enough. One day
he gave such bitter expressions, to the Secretary of the Embassy, that he could not forbear making
him some answer, whereat the other was so enrag'd, that he drew his knife at him, and
made him rise from the Table, with such injurious words, that the Secretary, at his return
into Holstein, was oblig'd to make his complaints thereof, to the Magistrate, who condemn'd
Brugman to make publick satisfaction. This ill correspondence, and alenation of minds, proceeded
chiefly from Brugman's being conscious to himself, of the many imprudent actions he
had done in our Travels, and the fear he was in to be punish'd, for those disorders, at his return
into Holstein, upon the prosecution of those, who had taken particular notice, and the
freedom many times, to mind him thereof.
                  This aversion of his reach'd even to the Minister, who being oblig'd, by the duty of his
Profession, severely to reprove the sins committed in the Company, had incurr'd Brugman's
displeasure in so high a manner, that he could not get of him to buy a suit of cloaths, in so
much, that, being, on some great Festival, to preach and administer the Sacrament at Scamachie,
it was found he had only a pair of Drawers under his Cassock, to the great scandal of all,
but particularly the Muscovian Ambassador, who liked our Liturgy, and would have given the
Minister a suit of cloaths, had he not stood in fear of the indignation and violence of the Ambassador
Brugman.
                  We understood also,A pernicious design of one of the Ambassadors. that he had a design to leave Astrachan, and to go by land, accompany'd
by some of his own Creatures, and to forsake the rest of the Company. The Muscovian
Ambassador, to whom he had communicated it, discovered it to us, and gave us notice, that
we should observe his actions, in as much as his intention was no better than that of Roussel,
who had betray'd the Marquess of Exidueil, and caus'd him to be sent prisoner into Siberia.
                  Soon after he had given us this notice, the Muscovian Ambassador took leave of us, to go
for Muscovy by land: but we have heard since, that, at his coming to Nise, finding Letters
from some friends, giving him to understand that he would not be well receiv'd by the Great
Duke, he went no further, but there took a dose of poison, whereof he died.
                  Iuly 25. came to Astrachan, a Muscovian Caravan, and, with it, a German, named Andrew
Reusner, who had Letters of recommendation from his Highness of Holstein to the King
of Persia. The Ambassador Brugman had a great deal of private discourse with him, which
begat such an intimacy between them, that instead of prosecuting his journey into Persia, he
oblig'd him to return back thence, and to undertake the sollicitation of his affairs at the Duke
of Holstein's Court.
                  August 1. the Muscovites celebrated, with great solemnities, the reduction of the City of
Astrachan, taken from the Tartars, on the same day, in the year 1554.
                  The same day came to see us two Cosaques,AUGUS. with Letters for the Ambassadors, from Alexei
Savinouits, whom they had met upon the River Wolga.
                  These Rogues freely told us, that they had successfully set upon and rob'd so many people,
that they were desirous to try how they should be able to deal with the Germans: That they
car'd not much for our Artillery, in regard that was only for the unfortunate: That they
heard, we had an invention to toss all that came neer us into the air: That they could not imagine
how it should be done; but that the worst they could fear was death, which they were

forc'd to suffer at a Gibbet, or upon a wheel, and that the hope of booty would make them
attempt any thing.
                  Aug. 6. came to Astrachan,The Persian Ambassador comes to Astracha??? Imanculi Sulthan, the Persian Ambassador; whom we had expected
so long, and the next day he made his entrance into the City.
                  August. 11. dy'd one of our Interpreters, named Kenry Krebs, and was buried the thirteenth,
in the Churchyard of the Armenians, with the ordinary Ceremonies.
                  September the 5. there went away a Staniza,SEPTEM. or Caravan, of about 200. persons, to go from
Astrachan to Moscou, by land. Andrew Resner, made his advantage of that opportunity, and
departed, taking some of our people with him.
                  The Ambassadors also took that convenience to send away some of their retinue with their
horses.The Ambassadors divide their Baggage. We began to set things in order to follow them by water, and to that purpose, bought
two great Boats, sixty foot in length, and fifteen in breadth, which cost us 600. Crowns,
and to every Sea-man, whereof there were thirty, we gave 12. Crowns, to bring us to Casan.
                  Not long before our departure, some Muscovian Musketteers brought, to be sold, to
the Ambassadors, a young Girl of ten years of age, whom they had taken from a School-Master,
who was a Tartar of Precop, at the taking of the City of Assou, which lies upon the Palus
Meotides, at the mouth of the River Don, and was taken by the Cosaques from the Turk,
on the firh of August.
                  They brought us also another Girl about seven years of age, whom they had stoln not far
from Astrachan, as she lay a-bed with her Mother. They had put her into a bagg, out of
which they cast her at the Ambassadors feet, as if it had been a sucking-Pigg, stark-naked. Her
Parents had made in her cheeks two blew marks, of the bigness of a Lentil, that she might be
known again, in case she were stoln.
                  The Ambassador Brugman,Brugman's charity. considering, that, in purchasing them, he should bring two
lost Sheep to the Fold of Iesus Christ, bought them both, one at 25. the other at 16. Crowns.
At his return he presented them to the Dutchesse of Holstein, who had them so well instructed,
that in the year 1642. they were both baptized, having before given a publick accompt of their
Faith.
                  Our Interpreter for the Turkish Language was also a Tartar-born, and had been stoln in his
Infancy and carried to Moscou, where he had been baptiz'd. His relations knew him again,
and would have redeem'd him; but he would not consent thereto, protesting he would dy in
the profession of the Christian Religion, since it was Gods pleasure to bring him to the knowledge
thereof. But ever after, he went not far from the Ambassadors Quarters, let he
might have fallen into the hands of his relations, who would have dispos'd otherwise of
him.
                  At this place,The Persian Ambassador buyes him a Wife. the Persian Ambassador bought him a Wife. She was a Tartar, and Sister to
a Myrsa, who was a prisoner, and who sold his Sister for a hundred and twenty Crowns in
money, and a horse, which the Ambassador valued at ten Crowns. This Ambassador was at
least seventy years of age, but very vigorous, and us'd much Hemp-seed, bak'd in the Embers,
whereof the Persians eat abundance, out of an opinion, that it revives Nature, yet
hinders Conception.
                  Sept. 7. we left Astrachan,Leave Astrachan. and embark'd upon the Wolga, the Ambassadors dividing their
retinue, and taking each of them a Boat. We cast anchor within half a league of the City, expecting
the Persian Ambassador, who came to us the next day, with three Boats. We gave
him a volley at this arrival, and set sail together.
                  The 10. we pass'd before the Iland of Busan, where the Tartars of Crim and Precop, are
wont to swim over the River, which in that place is somewhat narrow. The Muscovites, to
prevent them, had set a Guard there, of fifty Musketteers, who sent to us for some Bread,
and got a bag of Suchary.
                  The 15. we cast anchor before Tzornogar,Come to Tzornogar. which the Muscovites call also Michailo Novogorod,
from the Great Duke Michael Federouits, who built it, within three hundred werstes,
or sixty German leagues from Astrachan. The Weywode sent the Ambassadors a Latin Letter,
which Alexei Savinouits had left for them, and sent one to invite them to come to refresh themselves
in the City: but they would not lose so much time.
                  The 24. we got before Sariza,To Sariza??? two hundred werstes from Tzornogar.
                  The 29. the wind fair, we got forty werstes. The Muscovites attributed the cause of it to
the Great Duke's name, whose Feast was celebrated that day, being St. Michael's.
                  October 2. one of the Persian Ambassadors Boats was a-ground.OCTO. They were so long getting it
a-foat again, that the Ambassadors went ashore, where they dined together. Their people made
also acquaintances among themselves, and those of Persia took so much Aquavitae, that we were
forc'd to carry, and drag them to the Boats like so many Beasts.
                  The Persians must also needs fall out with the Musketteers, who guarded them. Cudgels and
Cymitars were employ'd, and the Ambassador himself, who was got as drunk as any of

his people, was going to draw upon them, when our Ambassadors came in, and reconcil'd
all.
                  The night following, one of the Persian Ambassadors Pages, who was sick of a bloody Flux,
fell into the water, yet none perceiv'd it till the next morning.
                  The 6. we came before Soratof,To Soratof. 350. werstes from Sariza. We there heard, that a party of
Cosaques would have set upon the Caravan; but fearing they might come by the worst on't,
they only cross'd their march with a great noise, and, by means of their breeding-Mares, got
away some Archemagues, or Persian horses, intended for breed.
                  The 14. the wind South-west, there rose such a tempest, that it scatter'd all our Boats. That
of the Ambassador Crusius, and two of the Persian Ambassador's, which carried horses, were
forc'd upon the shore, and immediately sprung such aleak, that we had hardly time enough to
get out our Baggage, & the Persians their horses, whereof there was one drown'd. This Tempest
having continued two daies, we got our Boats ashore, caulk'd them, and departed thence
the 17. but the Persian Ambassador, who had two Boats unserviceable, was forc'd to send
away his horses by land.
                  The 24. we came before the City of Samara,To Samara. seventy leagues from Soratof.
                  November the sixt,NOV. we pass'd by the mouth of the great River Kama, and entred, with
the night, into the River Casan:To Casan. in very good time for us, in regard the next morning, the
River Wolga was frozen over.
                  The Weywode of the City, Iohn Wasilouits Moroson, who, at the time of our former being
at Moscou, was Counsellor of State to the Great Duke, receiv'd us but very indifferently,
as well in regard the Ambassadors had not made their acquaintance with him by Presents, as by
reason of his siding with the Muscovian Merchants, who opposed our negotiation, and would
have prevented the establishment of our Commerce. The Ambassadors sent their Steward to
him, with the Great Duke's pass, intreating him they might be assigned Lodgings in the City;
but he sent him back with this answer, that he might return to the Boat, and there the Ambassadors
should hear further from him.
                  The next day, he sent to the Ambassador Brugman's Boat, a Sinbojar, who addressing himself
to the Ambassador, ask'd him, which of the two was the Ambassador, which the Merchant.
Brugman, thinking himself affronted by that discourse, took him by the arm, and said
to him, Go tell thy Master, that if he cannot read, let him get one that can, and withall
may shew him, what quality the Great Duke gives us. But notwithstanding all this, we were
forc'd to continue several daies on the River, though the weather were very cold. The Weywode
indeed sent us word, that we might lodge in the City for our money; but he issu'd out
orders, that none should entertain us, and commanded the Sentinel, who had permitted the
Steward to pass, and a Boy, who had been his guide through the marsh, from the River-side
to the City, to be cudgell'd.
                  Nov. 11. the Persian Ambassador made his entrance into the City, and was lodg'd in that
part of it which is bult of wood. He prevail'd so far with the Weywode, that he permitted us
to land, which we did the 13. taking up our Quarters in the Suburbs.
                  Nov. 20. the Ambassadors bestow'd the two Boats on the Weywode, and made him some other
Presents, which put him into another humour, and made him very much our friend.
                  December the 16. the Muscovites celebrated the Festival of their Patron,DECEM. St. Nicholas, for
the space of eight daies together, during which a man could see nothing but perpetual drunkenness,
and extraordinary bebauchdness, in both men and women. The Care or Parson of
the Parish, came one day to my Quarters, accompany'd by his Clerk, as well to incense
the Images, as to comfort the Mistress of the house, whose husband was put in prison for
debt.
                  He told us, that, about forty years before, there had been found in the Monastery of Spas,
which is in the said City of Casan, the bodies of two Monks, named Warsinosi, and Kursi,
whose sanctity was approved, not only, in that their bodies had been found entire, after so
many years, but also by the many miracles they did, there being no sick person but recover'd
his health, after he had done his devotions at their Sepulchre. I ask'd him, why he complain'd
of his back, and how it came to pass, there were so many blind people, and so great a number
of other sick persons at Casan. The Priest had not a word to say, but grew angry, and went
his way.
                  Having stay'd at Casan five weeks,Leave Casan. till the Ice and snow were able to bear, we departed thence,
the 13. of December, with sixty Sledges, leaving, by order of the Weywode, the Persian
Ambassador behind us.
                  We took our way upon the Wolga,Come to Nise. and came, the 21. to Nise, sixty leagues, or three
hundred werstes, from Casan. The Ambassadors lodg'd at Mr. Bernards our Factor, and the
retinue, up and down the neighbourhood. There it was we left the last Lutheran Church.
Their Pastor dy'd six months before, so that our Minister preach'd there, the Sunday before
Christmass. The said Church was very desirous, the Ambassadors should stay there till after

Christ-mass day, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper might be administred that day: but
the Ambassador Brugman was against it, and order'd our departure thence on the 23. in the afternoon,
qnitting the Wolga, to take our way by the River Occa, which was also frozen up.
                  The 25. we had a Sermon, at two in the morning, at a Village named Kurim, ten leagues
from Nise, and travell'd that day ten leagues further.
                  The 29. we came to Woladimer, 42. leagues from Nisan, and 28. from Moscou. The ruins
of the walls, towers and houses, which were to be seen up and down, are undeniable demonstrations
of the antiquity of the City.
                  December the last, we came to a Village, named Rubossa, within eight leagues of Moscou,
where our Pristaf, who had gone before, to acquaint the Great Duke with our arrival, came
and told us, that, within two daies we should make our entrance into Moscou. The Ambassador
Brugman fell into such a peevish humour at this place, that he threatned some of the retinue
to have their noses and ears cut off, assoon as he were come into the Frontters of Germany.
But his menaces troubled no body, nor did so much as any one offer to run away.
               
               
                  M.CD.XXXIX.
                  The first of Iunuary,1639. IANUA. we departed, before day, and travell'd five leagues, to a Village
named Bechra, whither we came betimes, and there did our devotions.
                  The 2. we made our entrance into Moscou,Make their entrance into Moscou. conducted by two Pristafs, whom his Czaarick
Majesty had sent to meet us. The Ambassadors sate, each of them with a Pristaf, in a
rich Sledge, lin'd with Crimson Satin, and hung with the richest Persian Tapistry, and the
chiefest of the retinue had excellent horses sent them from the Great Duke's Stable, all white,
twelve in number. We were lodg'd at the ordinary house appointed for the reception of Ambassadors,
and, during our stay there, we were supply'd with all things requisite for the Cellar
and the Kitchin. The Ambassadors horses, and such of our people as went from Astrachan
along with the Caravan, were arriv'd there some time before; and Reusner was gone for Holstein,
according to the agreement between him and the Ambassador Brugman.
                  Ian. 6. Twelf-day, the Muscovites celebrated the confecration of the holy Water; at which
Ceremony, the Great Duke and the Patriarch were in person.
                  The 8. the Ambassadors had their first private Audience, which laste'd above an hour.
                  The night following,The Czaar's second son dies. dy'd Knez Iuan Michaelowits, second son to the Czaar, in the eighth
year of his age.
                  His departure put the whole City into mourning, especially the Court. Both men and
women put off all manner of ornament, as gold, silver, jewels, and garments of silk, cloathing
themselves only in old vestments, for the most part of a dark grey colour.
                  Ian. 21. the Ambassadors had their second private Audience, and had a conference of two
hours. There were sent to them and those of their retinue black horscs, and they found the
whole Court hung with mourning, and all the Senators clad in black Chamlet.
                  Ian. 30. departed thence the Sieur Vchterichs. He had a long time before desir'd leave to
return into Germany, to look after some affairs of his own, but he could not obtain it of the
Ambassador Brugman till then, and that under a promise, that he would not carry Letters for
Holstein from any but himself. But he deceiv'd the deceiver, and shew'd him the Letters of the
Ambassador Crusius, who was content they should be seen, and carried away the rest without
shewing them to him.
                  February the second,FEBRU. died the Sieur Gruneauld, a Senator of Dantsig, who had travell'd
with us, as a Gentleman belonging to the Embassy. He was a person of much worth, and
one who had before travell'd into the East and West-Indies.
                  The 5. the Persian Ambassador made his entrance into Muscou, and the 8. had his first
Audience.
                  The 11. the Ambassador Brugman desir'd, and had, a private Audience, without acquainting
his Collegue therewith.
                  Febr. 23. the Ambassadors had their publick Audience, in order to their departure, at which
they took leave of his Czaarick Majesty.
                  March the 7. the Persian Ambassador departed,MARCH going before us, towards Germany.
                  The 15. the Ambassadors left Moscou making what haste they could thence,Leave Moscou??? that they might
have the convenience of Sledges, till they came to the Frontiers of Germany: and fearing, the
spring, then neer, would spoil the waies, they travell'd so hard, that the 18. they came to
Tuere, and the 19. to Tarsok.
                  Tarsok is but a small City, yet hath it thirty Churches and Chapels, whereof one is of stone,
and makes a handsome show at a distance: but the Muscovites would not permit us to come
within the City.
                  The 23. we came to great Novogorod,Enter Ingermania??? where we found the Persian Ambassador. We left
it the next day, and getting out of Muscovy the 27. entred Ingermania.
                  
                     
March the last, the three Ambassadors made their entrance into Narva, where Colonel
Wrangel came to meet us, with a party of fifty horse.
                  The Persian Ambassador was lodg'd at one of the Senators houses,Make their entrance into Narva. about which there was
got such a multitude of people, to see his wife, that he was half in a mind to get out of the
City, and take up his Quarters in the open fields, that none might see her: so that they were
forc'd to get the people away. This oblig'd him to take another course for the future, which
was, to have a Curtain drawn from the Wagon, or Sledge, that brought her, to the house
where she was to be lodg'd, that she might not be seen going in.
                  April the 14. the Ambassadors left Narva and lodg'd at the Village of Purtz where they
staid one day, to change their horses.
                  The 8. they came to Kunda,APRIL a house belonging to a Senator of Riga, where they staid four
dayes.Leave Narva. Here we were forc'd to give over travelling with Sledges, for want of snow, and to
make use of horses and waggons.
                  The 13. we came to Reuel,Come to Reuel. where the Senate receiv'd us very magnificently. The persecutions
which the Secretary of the Embassy was forc'd to suffer from the Ambassador Brugman,
oblig'd him to take the opportunity of a Vessel, which went thence the 15. for Lubeck, and so
for the Court of Holstein, where he expected the arrival of the Ambassadors, who staid three
whole months at Reuel, without any necessity for it, or other reason than this, that the Ambassador
Brugman, who was loath to return, as fearing what might be alleg'd against him,
would have it so.
                  Their stay in that City had this consequence, that many of the retinue found their satisfaction
there in the matter of Wedlock, and among others the Ambassador Crusius, who married a
Senator's daughter of that place.
                  Iuly the 11. the Ambassadors,JULY. and a Muscovian Poslanick, whom the Great Duke sent to
the Duke of Holstein,Embark at Reuel. embark'd, and after eleven daies sail, arriv'd upon the Coasts of Holstein,
neer the Iland of Femeren, intending to get into the haven of Kiel, but the contrary wind
oblig'd them to cast anchor,Come to Travemunde. before Neustadt, within two leagues of Lubeck. They soon understood
that the Plague was there, whereupon they immediately departed thence, and went to
Travemunde, whither they got the next day, Iuly the 23.
                  Thence they sent their people and the Baggage by Sea,To Eutin. to Kiel, and the Ambassadors came
the 28. to Eutin, where Duke Iohn of Holstein, Bishop of Lubeck, our Prince's Brother, receiv'd
us, and treated us magnificently.
                  The 30. they came to Kiel,To Kiel. where our Ambassadors left the Persian, and the Muscovian
Poslanick, to go and wait on His Highness, whom they found at Gottorp, the first day of

                  Right Worshipful,
               
               YOu have here the Travels of a young Gentleman,
who went along with the Embassie, sent by the
Duke of Holstein, into Muscovy and Persia. That
it was his resolution to see the other parts of Asia, appear'd
by the express permission he obtain'd from his own Prince,
before his departure, to do it. For the particular description
we have of Persia, we are indebted to Adam Olearius,
the Author of the Ambassadours Travels into Muscovy
and Persia, which I dare affirm to be such as is infinitely beyond
ought came abroad of that part of the World before.
What our present Author Mandelslo gives of it, is only
what lay in his way between Ispahan and the City of Ormuz.
But of his departure from the former, the motives upon
which he went, and the assistances he receiv'd from some of
this Nation, be pleased to receive this account.
               His acquaintainces with some English Merchants at Ispahan,
the Metropolis of Persia, heightned in him the design
of these Travels into the East-Indies; their recommendations
conducted him first to Ormuz, and afterwards thence to
Surat. The kindnesses he receiv'd from the English President,
and other Merchants he met with there, were such, as
not only ingag'd his stay some time, but also found him the
conveniences of divers Caravans, with whom he travell'd
into several parts of the Mogul's Country, and particularly
to the Court of that powerful Prince, where he had staid
longer, had not an accident, which happened at Ispahan, during
the time of the Embassy, occasion'd in his sudden removal

thence. But what further Observations he might have
made of those parts, are supply'd not only by the said Olearius,
but also by the person who rendred his Work into the
French, out of which, as being the most compleat, this Translation
into the English is done. Having continu'd among
the English Merchants at Surat, till the Ships bound for
England were ready for their departure, he comes thence,
along with Master Methwold, who had newly resigned his
charge of President to Mr. Fremling, at the Ceremonies
whereof he was present. Being come to London, he found
the same person, and others of the East-India Company as
liberal of their kindness and hospitality, as they had been in
those parts where he grew first acquainted with them; and
such they continued, till his desires to wait on his own
Prince, and put a Period to his Travels, occasioned his return
into his own Country.
               The civilities and endearments he receiv'd from them,
were indeed such, as not only, then, oblig'd the Person, to
whom they were shewn, but have, since, engag'd all those
who have made any advantage of the Travels occasion'd
thereby. It was therefore a noble and necessary gratitude in
the Author, to make the frequent acknowledgments he does
thereof in several places of his Work. It was a commendable
compliance with his humour, in those who put it into other
Languages, to propose both, as examples to their Countries.
But for my part, I conceive there lies the greater Obligation
upon me to make this address of my Labours herein, in that
I am to let the World know, whose incouragements it is obliged
to for these Travels, and to celebrate in our own Language
and Country what was so nobly and generously done
by some of your illustrious body in the more remote parts
of the Universe, and shew withall what induc'd me to this
presumption of assuming the quality of,
               
                  Right Worshipful,
                  Your most humbly devoted Servant,
I. DAVIES.
               
            
            
               
               THE
PREFACE.
               THe Relation of these our Travels would not be perfect, if at
the return of our Embassy,1638. we gave not an account what became
of Monsieur Mandelslo, whom we left at Ispahan, with
a design to travel into the Indies. This young Gentleman,
who was born in the County of Meklenburgh,Mandelslo's person. put off the
quality of Page, when his Highness the Duke of Holstein resolv'd
to send the Sieurs, Crusius and Brugman, into Muscovy
and Persia, and express'd so great a desire to see Countries
and Kingdoms so far distant from his own, that his said Highness did not
only suffer him to go along with the Embassadours, in the quality of a Gentleman
of the Chamber, but also to leave them as soon as they had finished their
Negotiation in Persia,His Design. and to put in execution the design he had to travel farther,
and see other parts of Asia.
               He was so well look'd upon in the King of Persia's Court,Sach Se loves him, and offers bin a Pension of 10000. Crowns. that that Monarch
press'd him to stay there for some years, and to that end profferd him many great
advantages, and among others, a Pension of five or six hundred Tumains, which
amount to near 10000. Crowns; many of the greatest about the Court, perceiving
that the King had an affection for him, courted his Friendship, and, one after
another, entertain'd him with continual Feasting, out of a hope to engage him in
the heat of Wine, and by such great expressions of their kindness towards him.
Those who were the most importunate with him, (and to that end appointed several
meetings, whereat they gave him all the divertisements which might induce
him to forget the inclinations he had towards his own Countrey) were the
Master of the Horse,He considers whether he were best stay at Ispahan. the great Faulconer, and the high Steward. They could not
absolutely prevail with him, but shook his resolution so, as that he went and advised
with the Prior of the Italian Carmelites, a person that by the abode of
twenty four years at Ispahan, was perfectly acquainted with the Court of Persia.
This good religious man, who was called Father Tinas, a person of eminent vertue
told him, that to put him out of the perplexity he was in, he would alledge unto
him two instances, whereby he might himself judge, what fortune he was to expect
in Persia. One was, that he had known a French Gentleman, who had so
well establish'd himself in the Court, that the King, who had employed him in two
great Embassies of great importance into Europe, which he very faithfully mnnaged,
had, to oblige him to spend the rest of his dayes in Persia, prevailed with
him to marry a Persian Lady, but allowing him the freedom to live according
to his own Religion. That some years afterwards, this Gentleman desired leave
to return into France, but the King forbad him to depart the Kingdom; and to

prevent him from attempting it, caused all he had to be seized upon. That, even
that unkindness had not smothered in him the desire he had to return into
France, so that he made his escape notwithstanding that prohibition; but he
was killed by the way. That his Lady, who had received Baptism, fled into the
Monastery of the Carmelites, where she lay concealed, till she had an opportunity
to disguise her self, and to go to Rome, whither the Pope had invited her. The
other Story was, that another Gentleman, an Italian, of the house of the Gabrieli,
who was no less favoured at the Court then the French man, growing weary of
living so long among Mahumetans, the professed enemies of his Religion, bethought
him to make a discovery to the King, of some notice he had, that there
were about Ormus certain Mines, out of which Gold might be gotten, and shewed
him a sample of it. The King did not so absolutely credit him, but that he
sent along divers Lords and Gentlemen, who were to observe him: but coming to
Gamron, he made them so drunk with Sack, which the Portuguese had furnished
him with, that he made a shift to get to the Sea-side, where finding a
Boat ready, he made his escape to Ormus. That this escape of his had so incens'd
the King, that it raised in Schach-Abas the first thoughts of besieging the City
of Ormus, which he reduced to his obedience the year following.
               To this the good Father added, that he had several other reasons to give him,
which might divert a Gentleman of his age, and one so handsome in person, from
staying in so depraved a Court as that of Persia: but that he conceived M.
Mandelslo himself was better acquainted with it, then to engage him in a
discourse of that nature. And indeed what he had said was enough to settle
his resolution, so that before they parted, Mandelslo promised him to leave Ispahan
with the soonest, and prosecute his design of going to Babylon, and thence
to Jerusalem, whence he made account to go to Aleppo, and to return by the Mediterranean
Sea into Europe. But having understood that the Grand Seigneur
had besieged Bagdat, or Babylon, he changed his resolution, and took that of going
to Ormus, and thence to the Great Mogul's Court, and so into the Indies.
               To that end having disingaged himself from the Embassadours on the one and
twentieth of December 1637. he stayed at Ispahan, till the 16. of January
following. But in regard he himself hath taken the pains to set down the particulars
of his Travels, and to make a very exact relation thereof, it were an injury
to him, not to let him speak himself. He begins his relation thus.
            
         
         
            
               MANDELSLO's
TRAVELS
INTO THE
INDIES.
            
               The First Book.
               THe Embassadours of Holstein, having left Ispahan, the Metropolis
of Persia, I resolved to make use of the Permission which
the Duke my Master had given me, and having taken my leave
of the Embassadours two Leagues thence, I returned to the
City, where I stayed almost a month, to put all things in order
for the prosecution of my Design. During which time the
King ordered Imanculi Esichagasi, a Native of Karabath, to
make himself ready for the Embassy, upon which he would
send him into Holstein.
               Accordingly, Ianuary 10. 1638. Imanculi sent away the
baggage, and the Presents that were to be made to the Duke,
consisting in excellent Horses, and several Stuffes of Gold and Silk, amounting, as they
were valued by the Persians, to 1500. Tumains, which make 20000. Crowns.
               They about the Court, who had express'd a kindness for me, perceiving I was fully resolv'd
to be gone, procured me a particular audience in order to my departure, to which I
was introduced on the 12. of IanuaryIANVARY. by the Master of the Horse. I kis'd the hem of
the Kings garment,Mandelslo leaves Ispahan. who with much kindness was pleas'd to allow of my departure. The
dayes following I spent in taking leave of my friends, and the 16. of Ianuary I left Ispahan,
with a retinue of three persons, a Chirurgeon, a Lacquey, and a Groom, all three Germans,
and one Persian servant, Mr. Honywood, Agent of the English at Ispahan, accompany'd
by several Merchants of the same Nation, and some French Merchants, brought
me a League out of the City.
               I travell'd that day eight Leagues,Comes to Majar. to a Village called Majar, where I stayd all the next
day, expecting a Carmelite Father, who had promis'd me his company. But hearing that
he had left Ispahan a day before me, I travell'd on the 18. and came that day to the Village
of Kamscha, six leagues from Majar.To Kamcha All this way was one continued walk, set with trees
on both sides in a direct line, with very pleasant Gardens adjoyning; so that I do not
think there can be a more delightful place then that Village? but the Carauansera, where
I was to take up my lodging, had nothing but the bare walls. The 19. I got six leagues,
to the Village of Machsud.Machsud. This Village hath a Carauansera well furnished with Lodgings
and Stables.
               The 20. I lodg'd in a Carauansera,Hannabath near a Village called Hannabath, which is very well

seated, on the descent of a pleasant hill. The 21. I travell'd 10. leagues, to a Carauansera,
cal'ed Iurgisthan,Jurgishan very ill way, and so much the more incommodious, by reason of the wind
and snow, which hindred me very much.
               The 22. I was forc'd to travel 12. Farsangs, or Persian Leagues; for, from Iurgisthan there
is neither Village nor Carauansera,Surma. where a man may be lodg'd; so that it was night ere I
got to Surma. By that great dayes journey, I overtook the Mules of certain Persian Merchants,
who came from Ispahan a day before me.
               The 23. I was in like manner forc'd to travel 12. Leagues,Gusi. to the Village of Gusti, where
we were very ill accommodated, our Horses having not so much as a house over their
heads, though it were very bad weather, and snow'd all night. The 24. we had a dayes
journey, as great as the two precedent, but a much worse way; for as soon as we were out
of Gusti, we came into mountains covered with snow, and had that day very cruel weather,
though the Countrey thereabouts a man may think should afford a very pleasant prospect
in Spring and Summer.Maderre Soliman. We lodg'd at night in a great Village, called Meshid Maderre
Soliman, by reason of a sumptuous Sepulchre, which is within half a league of it. The
Sepulchre is in a little Chappel built of white Marble, upon a high square of free-stonework,
so as that the going up to its is by steps of all sides. The air and rain have eaten into
the wall, in several places, but time hath in a manner consumed several great pillars of Marble,
whereof what remains may be seen all about the Structure: upon the wall of the
Chappel there are yet to be seen in Arabian Characters these words, Mader Suleiman. The
Inhabitants say, that Solomon's Mother was interr'd there; but the Carmelite Fathers of
Schiras, with more likelihood of truth, told me, that it was the Sepulchre of the Mother of
Scach Soliman, the 14. Calif, or King, of the posterity of Aaly. Elmacin, in his History
of Arabia, l. 1. c. 14. sayes, her name was Wallada, the daughter of Abbas Abbasceam,
and that this Soliman liv'd in the year 715. and relates, among other things, one very remarkable,
to wit, that the King, who was a very handsome graceful person, viewing himself
one day in a Looking-glass, said, that he might justly assume the quality of King of
Youth, as well as of his Kingdom; whereto one of the Seraglio-Ladies answered, that he
might indeed justly do it, if his beauty would continue still the same, and were not subject
to that change which is natural and common to all things; but that he must consider with
himself that it was perishable, and that happily he should not enjoy it long; and that these
words made such an impression in him, that, failing into a deep melancholy, he within a few
yes died of it. In this Village I met with the Carmelite Father, who came from Ispahan
before me, with an Armenian Caravan.
               The 26. I got five Leagues to the Village of Siwan;Siwan. Mardasch. The 27. six Leagues to Mardasch.
This last Village is very famous, for the Antiquities which are to be seen near it, and which
obliged us, as they do all that travel that way, to make a particular Observation thereof.
They are the ruines of an old Castle,Tzilminar. which the Persians, call Tzilminar, that is to say, forty
pillars from a word compounded of Tezehil, which signifies 40. and minar, a pillar or
Tower; in as much as the towers of the Metschid or Mosqueys of the Persians, having neither
bells nor steeples, are of the form and bigness of a pillar. They are no doubt the ruines
of one of the most magnificent structures that ever were; and the Persians say, that their
King Szemscid Padschal, Grand-father by the mother side to Alexander the Great, (of
whom mention is made in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours into Muscovy and
Persia) was the Founder of that Castle; though others say King Solomon built it; and
some would have it done by Darius, the last King of Persia. The Religious men of Schiras
told me,Persepolis that the learned were clearly of opinion, that the ancient Persepolis had stood
thereabouts, and that these were the ruines of Cyrus's Palace. Whatever they were, they
are at this day such as would ravish those who can ever so meanly judge of the excellency
of ancient Monuments. The Ground-work of it is twenty two Geometrical feet in
height, having at each of the four corners a pair of stairs of white Marble, consisting of
95. steps, which are very flat, and so broad, that twelve horse may go up together a-breast.
Upon the square of it, before you come within the structure, may be seen the ruines of
a wall, as also what is left of two great Gates, which have catv'd upon them each a horse,
with harness and saddles very antick; and in the two other pieces, two creatures, whereof
the hinder part hath some resemblance to the body of a horse, but the head, which is
crowned, resembles that of a Lion, and both have wings of each side. On the one side, there
are nineteen pillars of black and white Marble, whereof the least were eight, the biggest
tnels high, without the bases. They told us, that not long before there were forty pillars
standing; but it cannot be well judg'd, whether they had been design'd for the ornament
of some great Hall; or set there in the air purely for show. A little further are the
ruins of two chambers, which, as far as may be judg'd by the doors and windows, were

not very large. All is of Marble, so smooth and polish'd, that it might serve for a Looking-glass,
as well as that of the palace Royal at Ispahan. On both sides of the doors, there are
several figures of men, carved, whereof some are sitting, others stand, but much exceeding
the ntural proportion. They have all their hair so long, that it falls down over their shoulders,
great beards, and habits falling down to their heels, with very wide sleeves, and a girdle
about their garments. They have all round caps upon their heads; which, being much
different from the ordinary habit of the Persians at present, argues a great antiquity. At
a small distance, there are two other Chambers, built after the same manner, and of the
same bigness, whereof there is nothing left but the doors, and the cross-bars of the
windows.
               The structure seems to have had many doors, which the Persians observe to this day in
their buildings, so to make way for the winds they stand in need of to cool themselves.
Near these chambers there may be seen, engraven upon a square pillar, certain unknown
characters, which have nothing common with either the Greek, Hebrew, or Arabian, nor
indeed with any other language. There are twelve lines of these characters, which, as to
their figure, are triangular, Piramidal, or like obelisques, but so well graven and so proportionate,
that those who did them cannot be thought Barbarians: Some believe they are
Telesmes, and that they contain some secrets which Time will discover. Besides these,
there is also a great Court, upon the same ground-work, which is ninety paces square,
having on each side two gates, whereof some are six, others but three paces wide, all built
of a very well polish'd marble, whereof the several pieces are eight foot in length and
three in breadth. In another Court there are represented in carv'd-work, in marble, battels,
triumphs, and Olympick games, very well done, and with an exact observance of proportion.
Upon every gate is represented a man, with a graceful countenance, sitting, and
holding in one hand a Globe, in the other a Scepter, though the Kings of Persia never sate
in that posture. I had the curiosity to get up on high, where I found the figure of a King
at his devotions, adoring the Sun, Fire, and a Serpent. It is not easie to affirm, whether
the Architecture of this Palace be of the Ionick, Dorick, or Corinthian order, the building
is so ruin'd, though there be yet as much left as would find work for a good able
Painter for six months. 'Tis a thousand pities, that no body hath yet had the curiosity to
have it graven, had it been only out of this motive, that the barbarous people thereabouts
ruine it dai more and more, and convey away the stones to carry on private buildings.
Aeian sayes,Lib. 1. c. 5. that the Grand Cyrus was grown famous for the Palace he had built in the
City of Persepolis, whereof he had himself laid the foundation; Darius, for that built by
him at Susa; and Cyrus the younger, for the pleasant Gardens which he had himself
planted and cultivated in Lydia.Lib. 17. If this be the same place which Diodorus Siculus makes
mention of it is certain, that both as to greatness and magnificence it exceeded all those of
that time. He sayes it was encompass'd with three walls of Marble, whereof the first
was 16. the second 32. and the third 60. ells high, with the gates and balconies of brass.
The work of so many years, and all that wealth were destroy'd in a few hours, by Alexander
the great, who, upon the perswasion of a common Prostitute, caused it to be fired, as
Quintus Curtius gives an account of it in his History.Lib. 5??? c. 7. Having view'd these Antiquities,
which with those of Derbent, were all we met with in our Travels, I prosecuted my journey
the 28. of Ianuary, and got that day ten Leagues, to the City of Sehiras.
               In this City I met with four Italian Carmelites, who have a very handsome well built
Monastery there, and enjoy an absolute liberty of conscience, under the jurisdiction of
the King of Persia.The City of Schiras described. There had also been heretofore a Monastery of Austin-Friers; but
they were forc'd thence, with the other Portuguez, when the City of Ormus was taken
from them. Schiras is the chief City of the Province of Fars, at 29. degrees, 36. minutes,
seated in a very pleasant place, at the foot of certain Mountains upon the River Sendemer,
heretofore called Arxes, which disembogues it self into the Persian Gulf. We were told,
the City had been much bigger then it is now, though there be in it at present above ten
thousand houses; which I the more easily credited, in that we found all about it, and
half a league beyond, the ruines of the gates and walls of a great City. Whatever Nature
supplies mankind withall, not only for necessity, but also for pleasure, is here to be had
in great abundance; as Wheat, Wine, Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranats, Almonds, Dates,
Pistachoes, &c. and the lovely Cypress-trees afford a pleasant shade against the excessive
heats. The best Wine of all Persia grows hereabouts, and in such abundance, that it is
transported all over the Kingdom, especially to the Court, where the King and great Lords
drink not any other. 'Tis more sprightly, and more pleasant then Canary; but in regard
no person of quality but drinks of it, and is willing to treat his friends with Schiras Scharab,
it is dear enough at Ispahan, where it is sold at half a Crown a pottle. The soil

hereabouts is very fertile, and produces abundance of Wheat and Fruit. The Sheep which
are of an Ash-grey colour, with an eye of white, have their wooll curled or frizled, and their
tails are so big, and so fat that they weigh 18. or 20. pound. The adjacent Forrests afford
abundance of Mastick, which the Country people gather in dishes fastned to the Trees.
It is at first green, but the Air in time corrupting it gives it the brown colour it is of, when
brought into Europe. I stayed eight dayes at Schiras, as well to rest my Horses as to fortifie
my self against the hardship I was to expect in my future travel, it being a hundred
Leagues to Ormus, through a Country where I should not find what I left behind me at
Schiras, which is doubtless the principal City of Persia, for Wine and Women; and affords
so great enjoyments to those who can use these two things with moderation, that the Persians
are wont to say,FEBVARY. that if Mahomet had tasted the pleasures of Schiras, he would have
desired God to make him immortal there: I left it the fifth of February, and passed by
two Caravanseras, and took up my lodging at the third, having travell'd that day ten
Leagues, through a fair even way.
               The sixth, I got seven Leagues, having a very bad way, but in sight of many Villages,
whereof the prospect was the more pleasant, by reason of the Date-trees all about
them.
               The seventh I passed by one of these Caravanseras, and got that day ten Leagues, taking
up my quarters in the little City of Scharim, in the middle of a Forrest of Date-trees. The
five dayes following were the most troublesome of all my life. For the eighth of February,
we got but five Leagues, through the most horrid way in the world. I cannot imagine
how people made a shift to travel that way, before Imanculi Chan (of whom somewhat
hath been said elsewhere, who was so cruelly put to death with all his children, by Schach
Sefi) caus'd it to be repaired, with incredible expence, when at this day a man cannot pass,
but in great danger of his life, by reason of the uneven and narrow wayes, between steepy
mountains on the one side, and dreadful precipices on the other; where I very narrowly
avoided a mis-fortune, which happens there very often. For my Horse's hoof, which I
was leading by the bridle, being fill'd with snow, he stumbled upon me, forc'd me out of
the way, so as that had I not caught hold of a wild Almond tree, which happened to be
there, as it were by miracle, I had there ended both my travel and life, in the precipices.
I lodg'd at night in a Caravansera, where I had a house over my head; but that was all,
for there was neither provender for my horses, nor any thing for my self and my servants
to eat.
               The ninth, having travell'd three Leagues, I came to a Caravansera, where I found horsemeat.
After dinner, I got five Leagues farther, to another Caravansera; but meeting there
with the Armenian Caravan, and the Carmelite Father, whom I spoke of before, I rode on,
and travell'd two Leagues farther to a Village called Berry,Berry. and lodg'd not far from it, in
one of the best Caravanseras that I met with in all my journey.
               The tenth I had very ill way along the mountain: I preferred this before another fairer
way, which I might have taken by the Plains, but more about by four Leagues: Lte at
night I came to the City of Laar.
               The City is seated at the foot of a Mountain,Lar. in a spacious Plain, its houses are built of
brick bak'd in the Sun; but the Citadel is very advantagiously seated on the mountain, and
well fortified with a Rampire of free-stone. There is no Wine, but abundance of Dates
in these parts. The Inhabitants drink only water, which being thick and troubled, must
needs be vey unwholsome, as is also the Air thereabouts; whence it comes that no Inhabitant
almost but is troubled with a kind of worm, which breeds between the flesh and the
skin, about an ell long, and which is with much difficulty got out after the manner we shall
have occasion to speak of hereafter; hitherto we had been more sensible of cold then heat;
but in this place we began to think the heat of the Sun troublesom.
               I stayed one whole day at Laar; but when I would have gone thence the twelfth, they
would not suffer me to go out of the Caravansera, till I had paid half a Tumin, which
amounts to between forty and fifty shillings. I stood out, and alledged, that being no
Merchant, they could not exact that duty from me: but the receiver of it very much
preing the payment, I sent my Pasport, and the Letters of recommendation which the
King had written on my behalf to the Sultan of Gamron, to the Governour of the Citadel,
who immediately sent an Officer of the Garrison, with order for my departure, without
any further trouble.
               They say the City of Laar was built by Pilaes, the son of Siroes, who had to his Successor
Gorgion Mlch,Laar described. first King of Laar, and of whom the two and thirtieth Successor was
Ebrahim Chan, who was ejected by Sach Abas, King of Persia, in the year 1602. It hath
about four thousand houses, but neither gats nor walls, but only a Castle built there by

the Persians since their conquest, upon a steepy rock, which commands the City, there being
but one way to go up to it, and that so narrow, that two horses can hardly go abreast
in it. The walls of it are cut out of the rock, and the Garrison consists of a hundred
men, a suffiient number to make good that place, though there be in the Magazine Arms
for three thousand men. The water they have within it is brackish; so that those of the
Garrison are oblig'd to save that which falls from the Sky, whereof they have abundance
at certain seasons of the year. I travell'd that day 14. Leagues to a Caravansera near a
little Village.
               This great dayes journey did me no small prejudice,The Authors indisposition. though I had felt some alteration in
my health at my departure from Schiras. But the great journeys, especially the last I had
made since; the water, which was troubled and corrupted, and the insupportable heats,
brought me to such gripings in the belly, which were accompanied by an oppression of the
stomack, and a very great looseness, that I began to be out of all heart. I caused enquiry
to be made for a Litter, but there being none to be found, I was forc'd to get on the Horse
which carried the sumpter, which I had so ordered, as that I had the convenience of resting
my back. In that posture I went away the 19. and got that day to a great Village within
12. Leagues of the City of Gamon, and took up my lodging at the Calenter's of the place.
In the evening came to the same lodging an English man, who was to succeed him who
was the chief of the Merchants at Ispahan, accompanied by another Merchant of the
same Nation, with whom I had some acquaintance during my abode at the King of Persia's
Court. They were well provided with that kind of Spanish Wine, which is called
Seck, though the true name of it be Xeque, from the Province whence it comes; which,
together with two good meals whereto they had invited me, a little comforted my stomack,
and recruited my spirits, at least as far as the posture of my health would permit.
They gave me Letters of recommendation to an English Merchant of Bandar Gamron,
whom they intreated to lodge me in the Indian Company House there, and to assist me all
that lay in his power, in my Voyage to Suratta. They took horse after supper, but my
indisposition kept me there till the 22. of February.Leaves Laar. That day I travelled six leagues to
a Caravansera, where I rested my self till the heat of the day was over, and then got three
leagues further to another Caravansera. I grew worse and worse, insomuch that my former
indisposition being heightned into a burning Feaver, I was reduc'd to the greatest extremity.Comes to Gamron.
But there was no staying in a place where I could not be reliev'd, so that I resolv'd
to get to Bandar, whatever it cost me, out of the confidence I had that there, among
so many Merchants of several Nations who trade thither, I should find some ease. Accordingly,
as soon as I was got thither, the 23. of February, the English, French and Dutch
came to give me a visit, and having had an account of my quality and design, as also of
the nature of my indisposition, which was come to a bloudy Flux, with a burning Feaver,
they took me so much into their care, that within four dayes the Feaver left me, and I
made a shift to visit the Sulthan or Governour of the City.
               I had before sent him the Letters of recommendation which Schach Sefi had given me,Dines with the Sulthan.
directed to him, so that he no sooner heard of my recovery, but he sent to invite me to dinner,
whither I went the 28. As soon as I was come into the room, he made me sit down
by him, and to further my diversion and entertainment, he had intreated the Dutch Merchants
to bear me company, by which means I had the opportunity to be acquainted with
them. I shall say nothing of the particularities of this Entertainment, because there was
nothing in it extraordinary, or more then we had seen at Ispahan and elsewhere.
               The same day came to Gamron a Vessel from Suratta, of 600.MARCH. Tun burthen. It belong'd
to the Governour of Suratta, who had employ'd an English Carpenter in the building of
it. There came in it a certain Queen, who was a Widow, Mother to the King of Glkende,
with her Daughter. The King fell in love with the Daughter, and would have married
her, but the Mother would by no means consent to that incest, upon which he had forc'd
her out of the Kingdom. The Daughter came along with her Mother, preferring the
miseries of exile before the enjoyments of that incestuous marriage. It was reported, the
Mothers design was to marry her Daughter to the King of Persia, or one of the chiefest
Lords of the Kingdom.
               March 11. The Pesians celebrated their Nurus, or first day of their year, with the
ceremonies mentioned in the fourth book of the precedent Travels into Persia; the same
day the Sulthan invited me again to dinner, with several English and Dutch. In the evening
came to Bandar Mr. Chapman, whom I had met near Laar, who had accompany'd the
new English Captain who was going to Ispahan. He brought along with him another
English Merchant, with whom I had contracted a particular friendship, and whose conversation
was so much the greater comfort to me, in that from my departure from Ispaan, I had

not met with any friend that I could in the least be confident of. For though the Dutch
entertain'd me very highly,Mandelslo's distrust of the Dutch. and made great expressions of their kindness towards me, yet
could I not well trust them, especially when I consider'd how little reason they had to have
any affection for us, after the difference we had had with them at Ispahan.
               March 13. I left the Caravansera,Quem laesimus, oimus. to take up my Lodgings at the House belonging to the
English, who incessantly importuned me to accept of it.
               The 21. came to Gamron one Mr. Hall an English Merchant, with 253. Bails of Silk,
valued at 200 l. a Bail, which he had received upon the account of the sum of 30000.
Tumains, or 150000. Pistols, which the King of Persia was endebted to the English, for
one moyety of the Customs of Gamron, whereof we shall speak more anon.
               The same day died my Surgeon of a burning Fever, on the seventh day of his sickness.
I must confess the loss of him was a very great affliction to me. For besides the great services
he had done me, and those he might still do me in my sickness, which I had not quite
shaken off; I might have expected many other good offices from him, upon the account of
his being well skill'd in the Languages he had gotten by travelling into Spain, Italy, Poland,
and the East Indies, where he had been twice. To alleviate this affliction, I went one
day abroad a walking with one of the English Merchants, along the River side, where I saw
one of those Trees which Q. Curtius makes mention of in the ninth Book of his History,
in these terms, Alexander having crossed the River with Porus, went a good way into the Indies,
where he saw Forrests of a very vast extent full of trees, which were very thick with
boughs, and of an extraordinary height. Most of the Branches being as big as the boal of ordinary
Trees bow'd down to the ground, and having taken earth, grew up straight again, so that
a man would think they were not branches that started up, but other trees growing upon their
own roots.
               And indeed so it was, that the branches which came out of the boal of the tree, getting
to the earth did there take root, and made another new tree, which at the height of fifteen
or twenty foot cast forth other branches, and so became a Forrest, rather then a Tree, since
that which I saw there was two hundred and fourteen paces about, and might well afford
shade to two thousand persons.Arbol de Rays, or the Indian Fig-tree. The Portuguez call it Arbol de Rays, and those who have
written the natural History of those parts, The Indian Fig-treee, by reason of its
fruit, which is about the bigness of a mans thumb, and full of grains within, as the common
Fig, but its taste more unpleasantly lushious, and its colour red, and the leaves of the
tree are much like those of the Quince-tree.
               At the foot of that tree,The Sepulchre of a Benjan Saint. from which all the rest sprung, there is a little Chappel, built in
honour of an Indian Saint, or Benjan, that lies buried there. The Guardian of the Sepulchre,
who sate at the door, received us very kindly, and treated us with a collation of Almonds,
Nuts, Dates, and very good fair Water. He suffered us to come into the Chappel,
where we found the Saints Tomb all strew'd with Beans of several colours, and above
it, under a Canopy of Satin, several Lamps, which the Religious man is obliged to
keep in night and day. We shall have occasion to speak elsewhere of the Religion of the
Indians, and particularly of that of the Benjans; and therefore we shall here only say, that
it was not by chance that the Tomb was covered with Beans; but hence, that that Saint,
and the Guardian of his Sepulchre, were of the Sect which is called the Benjans, who
trade much to Gamron, and believe, with Pythagoras, that the souls of departed persons retreat
into Beans: an opinion which is very common, not only among the Heathens of the
Indies, but also all over China.
               April 1.APRIL. there came to Gamron an Envoy from Scach Sefi,Schach Sefi sends the Sulthan of Gamron an ssurance of his savour. King of Persia, who brought
the Sultan a present, which was a Garment, as an assurance to him of the favour of his
Prince. The Sulthan got on horseback, without any Arms about him, and having desir'd
the English and Dutch Merchants to honour him with their company in his Cavalcade,
and to afford him their presence at that Ceremony, I got in among them, and follow'd him
about a quarter of a League out of the City, where the Envoy had caused a Tent to be
pitch'd in the Field. Being got thither, they made us all sit down, but the Sulthan stood,
and with great submission receiv'd the Kings Letter, which he kiss'd and put to his forehead,
as also the Robe, which the Envoy presented to him at the same time, with the Turbant
and Girdle, which were of a very fine and thin silk, with Flowers of Gold. He immediately
put on the Robe, and the other Presents, and having made a short prayer for the
Kings prosperity, lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, and receiv'd the Complements
of the whole company, he mounted again, and return'd to the City where he was received
with the great Guns of both the Castles. At the entrance of his Palace he met the Molla,
who made a speech to him that lasted a quarter of an hour, after which the Sulthan treated
the strangers, and the principal Officers of the Garrison very magnificently.
               
                  
The City of Gamron,A description of the city of Gamron. or Bandar Gamron, i. e. the Port of Gamron, lies at 27. deg. latitude.
For though the Persians and Arabians in their Catalogues put it at 25. degr. yet is the observation
which the Hollanders have made of it, and which we here follow, very just and
exact; it being certain, that most of the Maps that have been yet made, and particularly
that of Persia, are very defective.The errour of certain Geographers. Their errour proceeds hence, that they put the Caspian
Sea too high, and consequently allow Persia a greater breadth from North to South, then it
really hath. For they put the City of Resht at 41. degrees, whereas it is at 37. and so the
breadth of all Persia can be but 10. degrees, taking it from Gamron to Rescht, or 12. at most,
if we should grant Ormus to be at 25. degrees: so that Boterus is extreamly mistaken, when
he allows Persia the extent of 18. degrees.
               It is not long since that this place was but a little Village, consisting of some few Huts,
which the Fishermen had set up for their conveniencies, and it is since the reduction of
Ormus that the goodness of the Port hath rais'd it to a City of great Trade. The Dutch
and English Ships, and the Moor Bottoms which come there daily, by reason of the convenience
of the Road, and the Merchants of Ispahan, Schiras, and Laar, who bring their
stuffes thither, as Velvet, Taffaa, raw-Silk, &c. and exchange them for others, will in time
make this City one of the most considerable of all the East.The Scituation of Gamron. It is seated upon the Persian
Gulf, between two good Castles, which defend it against the descent of Pirates, and keep
the entrance of the Haven, where there is a square Redoubt, with four pieces of Canon
upon it. The Fortifications of the Castle are antick, with round Bastions, but very well
furnished with great Guns. The Haven is so commodious, that Ships may anchor very
safely at five or six fathom water.Its Houses. The houses at Gamron built of a certain stone,
which they make of stiff Clay, Sand, shredded-Straw and Horse-dung mixt together,
whereof having set a Layer, they cover it with a Layer of Straw or Fagots, and then another
Layer of Clay and Straw, and so alternately, till they have brought it six or seven
foot high: then they set fire to it, and so bake the Stone; and to fasten and cement them
together, they make a composition of the same Paste with Salt-water, and some Lime,
and by that means make a kind of Mortar, which is almost as hard as the Stone it self.
               The best Houses are those of the Sulthan, or Governour of the City, and the Lodgings,
or Ware houses of the Dutch and English, which lie so near the Sea, that at High-water
the Tide comes up to the walls of them, which is a great convenience for the loading and
unloading of their Merchandizes. The lower rooms serve for Kitchins and Ware-houses,
and the upper for Lodgings, which are the more commodious in this respect, that being
high, they are the more fit to receive the wind of all sides, so in some measure to moderate
the excessive heat of the Sun. The meaner sort of people have no other covering over
them, then what they make with the branches and leaves of Date-trees, which they call
Adap,Its Streets. and are the only trees that find them fruit, and timber for building. The Streets are
narrow,The Air. irregular, and not kept clean. The Air is very unwholsom thereabouts, by reason
of the excessive heat, as also of the continual change of the Winds which rign there,
and which in the space of twenty four hours go through all the points of the Compass.
For in the morning they have an East-wind, which is extreamly cold; about noon a
South-wind, which brings insupportable heats along with it; in the evening a West-wind,
which coming fromwards Arabia, brings sufficient heats with it; and at midnight a
North-wind, which comes out of the Mountains of the Country, and is cold enough. It
rains so seldom, that it was observed in the year 1632. that with the rising of the Wind,
there falling a great shower,A great drought. after a continual drought of three years, the Inhabitants kept
a day of publick thanksgiving for it. Whence it comes that in the Country all about this
City, there is not so much as a Grass to be seen, unless it be in some Gardens, where they
are forc'd, twice or thrice every day, to water the Pot-herbs and Pulse which they sow in
them, and among the rest, particularly, Garlick, Onions, Chibols, Radishes and Cucumbers.
But the Isle of Kismisch,The Isle of Kismisch. which is but three Leagues distant from Gamron, and which is 15.
Leagues in length, and three in breadth, supplies the City with all sorts of Fruits. For in
the moneth of Iune, and during the greatest heats of Summer, they have Grapes, Damsens,
Peaches, Mangas, Quinces, Oranges, Lemons, and Pomegranates red and white. In
October they have Melons, Citruls, Cucumbers, Radishes, Onions, Turneps, Almonds, Pistachoes,
Apples, Pears, and several other Fruits, which are very excellent, and in such abundance,
that they are cheaper there then in any other place of Persia. The Inhabitants
live for the most part upon Fruits, and Pulse, and the Fish which they take in the neighbouring
Sea, and find more wholsom and delicious then Flesh, which meeting with but
little good sustenance, by reason of the extraordinary heats, must thereabouts be of ill nourishment,
and in a manner without any taste. Among other sorts of Fish, they take there
abundance of Pilchards and Smelts, as also Oysters and Crabs. They have good store of

Cattle, as Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Goats, and several other Creatures; but they have such
abundance of Goats, that they are sold for six or eight pence a piece. There are also a
sort of Rams that have four horns, but no wild Fowl at all. Their ordinary drink is only
Water, unless it be that some have a little Aqua vitae, made of Dates or Rice. Schiras
Wine, which is brought thither only in Bottles, is very scarce and very dear there; nay
the fair Water, which they get two Leagues from the City, is sold at such a rate, that what
I and my servants spent, cost me about two pence every day.
               Persons of quality, and Merchants, are clad after the Persian mode, but all the rest go
naked, and cover only the privy parts. The Women wear about their arms and legs a
great many Rings, or Plates of Silver, Brass, or Iron, according to their conditions and abilities.
They fasten to their hair a Bodkin, or a long flat piece of Silver gilt, or Brass, which
hangs down over the middle of their foreheads to the end of the nose, and they thrust
through the left nostril a Gold Ring, having in the middle a Turquese, a Granat, or haply a
little Gold Knob or Button enamell'd, or simple, and the Pendants they wear in their
ears are so heavy, that if those were not well fastned to their heads, they would go near to
force them thence.
               The great heats begin to abate in October, and so from that time till the beginning of
May is the season of greatest trading. Then it is that all Nations come thither with their
Commodities, as Persians, Arabians, Indians, Banians, Armenians, Turks, Tartars, English
and Dutch. These last come thither by Sea, but all the others by Land, with the Caravans,
which they call Caffilas, and which go at a certain day from Aleppo, Bagdat, Ispahan,
Sciras, Lahor, Herat and Bassara; coming all together in Troops, and having a Convoy
of certain Ianizaries, for the Security of their travel, against the incursions of the Arabians.
               The Hollanders and the English bring thither ready money,The Traffick of the English and Dutch there. and some certain Commodities,
which they either take up in Europe, or go to the Indies for, and sell them there to
very good profit. The Dutch are the better settled there of the two, and do furnish in a
manner all Persia, with Pepper, Nutmegs, Cloves, and other Spicery, though they also expend
very much ready money in their trading, as we said before, and especially Spanish
Ryals and Rixdollars, which the Persians prefer before all other money, because they melt
them, and make them into their own Coins with great advantage.
               The English do either sell or truck their English Cloaths, Tin, Steel, Indico, Silk Stuffes,
and Cottons out of the Indies; forthough there are excellent good ones made in Persia,
yet are those of the Indies more esteemed, because they are finer and closer woven. They
buy of the Persians Satins purfled with Gold or Silver, Silk-Stuffes, and the Cottons of the
Country, Persian Tapistry, which those of the Country call Klichey, and the Portuguez,
Alcatifer, raw Silk, Cotton, Rhubarb, Saffron, and Rose-water. This Water is made at
Schiras, and in the Province of Kerman, either by infusion, and then they call it Gul-ab,
whence no doubt the word Iulip comes, or by extraction in a Still, and then they call it
Areka-gul, that is to say, the swe of Roses. They esteem the former incomparably beyond
the other, and it is one of the best Commodities that a man can carry to the Indies,
where they sprinkle it about their Chambers, and use it in the preparations of perfumes.
There is made also in those parts great quantities of Linnen-cloath; but the Weavers,
instead of doing their work in Looms at their houses as they do elsewhere, fasten the woof
of the cloath to some Tree, without the City, and having made a pit in the ground, they
put their feet into it, so that when they come home at night, it is no great trouble for them
to bring their work and things belonging thereto along with them, in as much as they consist
only of certain Canes fastned to the woof.
               They have a certain Copper Coin,Their oney. which they call Besorg, whereof six make a Peys, and
ten Peys make a Chay, which is worth about five pence English. Two Chays make a Mamondy,
two whereof make an Abas, and three Abas's make a French Crown. A hundred
Mamoudis make a Tumain,Weights. which is worth five Pistols. As to their weights, a Man weighs
six pounds, a Mancha twelve, and a Mansurats thirty.
               There is also a great commerce of Pearls,Pearls. which are fisht for near the Isle of Bahram, six
Leagues from Gamron.The mnrer of fishing for them. They put about the Fisher-mans head a Cap or Case of boyled
Leather, so close, as that it hath no hole but by a pipe which comes up above the water. In
that posture he is let down to the bottom; where he gets together all the Shells he can meet
withall, and having fill'd a bag therewith which hangs about his neck, upon a sign made to
his Camerades, who wait on him in a Boat, he is drawn up.
               The Governour of the City hath the quality of Sulthan,The King of Persia's Offiers at Gamron. and hath under him, not a
Calenter, but a Visir or Secretary, and a Couteval, who is, as it were, the Captain of his
Guard.
               
                  
The King of Persia hath there also a Sabandar, or Receiver, who does not only receive
the duties at the coming in, and going out of Commodities, but sets such an Imposition
upon them as he thinks fit, and strictly searches the Ships, to see what Merchandises are
brought in. The Hollanders pay no duties, according to a priviledge they obtaind of
Scach-Abas, and whereof they endeavour all they can to preserve the enjoyment by
the Presents they ever and anon make to the Officers of the Court of Persia:
But the English are so far from paying any thing,The priviledges of the Engish at Gamron. that on the contrary they enjoy many other
priviledges and exemptions, and should by right receive one half of the Customs, upon
what account we shall declare anon, but they have hardly the tenth part allowed them,
nay, are obliged to take that little which they have in Commodities. And this the Persians
do with so much confidence, and so openly, that they stick not to affirm, when they are
surpriz'd in their frauds, that it is not ill done of them to endeavour the advantage of their
own Prince, though ever so much to the prejudice of Strangers, especially if they be Christians.
Among others, the English have this further priviledge, to send away yearly out of
Persia twelve Horses, without paying any thing, whereas the Dutch are obliged to pay for
the Licence of Transportation fifty Crowns at least for every Horse, as the English are
also, if they send away above twelve.Persian Horses much esteem'd among the Indians. The Persians, who have a great advantage over the
Indians in this respect, that they are better hors'd then the others, are very unwilling that
Horses should be sent over to the Indians, who are their enemies, among whom they are so
highly esteem'd, that an ordinary Horse there will bring four hundred Crowns.
               The Inhabitants of Gamron are for the most part Persians, Arabians, or Indians, but all
in a manner speak the Portuguez Language, which they learnt by the Commerce they have
had with that Nation, who were a long time possest of the City of Ormus. But now, that
is the only Nation which is not permitted to come to Gamron, though all others are suffered
to trade there. Christians and Iews are welcome thither, as also Mahumetans and Pagans;
but ever since the reduction of Ormus, the Portuguez, and the King of Spain's Subjects,
are not admitted thither; yet these last are suffered to come to a little Island within
three Leagues of it, and there to traffick, where the King of Persia hath a Sulthan, who
commands the Castle, receives the Duties at coming in and going out, and hinders the Portuguez
from approaching with their great Vessels: so that these Nations being, as it were,
in open Hostility, the Portuguez come sometimes with their Frigots, and take Prizes even in
sight of Gamron, and often Land parties in the neighbouring Islands.
               The City of Ormus is seated in an Island,The City of Ormus described. which is distant from the Continent two
Leagues, and is thought to be about six about. It is as barren as the Country about Gamron,
for it is a continued Rock, which produces nothing but Salt; insomuch that it doth
not yield even fresh Water. And yet its Haven is so good, and its scituation so advantageous,
that the City became so eminent for Commerce, that not only it had its particular
Kings, but the Arabians said of it by way of Proverb, that if the Universe were but a
Ring, the City of Ormus was the Diamond that should be set in it. Teixera sayes, that
Scach Mahomet, the son of an Arabian King, who liv'd in the tenth Age, having reduc'd
under his Jurisdiction the Provinces that are seated upon the Persian Gulf, as far as Besra,
pass'd over into the Island, where he laid the first foundations of the City of Ormus. Schabedin
Mahomet, eleventh King of Ormus, of the posterity of Mahomet, dyed in the year
1228. And he who liv'd when the Portuguez became Masters of it, was called Syfadin,
and paid Tribute to the King of Persia. D. Alfonso d' Albuquerque made a Conquest of it
in the year 1605: for Emanuel King of Portugal; of which attempt, the manner and success
of it, take the following Account.
               Tristan de Cugna,Taken by the Portuguez. who had taken the Island of Zocotora, whereof we shall have occasion
to speak hereafter, left certain Vessels under the command of Albuquerque, with Orders to
visit the Coasts of Arabia, while he attempted some new Conquest in the Indies; he being
a person of great resolution, thought his only course, to settle himself there, was to set
upon the Kingdom of Ormus, which he did with 470. Souldiers, whom he had aboard his
Fleet. Emanuel Osorio, Bishop of Selvas in Portugal, sayes, that Albuquerque made his
advantage of the Mahumetan Kings weakness, who then reigned. For understanding that
the principal Minister of State, whose name was Cojeatar, a Forreigner, a Native of
Bengala, and an Eunuch, had exasperated the people against him, by converting the publick
Revenue of the Kingdom to his own profit and advantage, having left his Soveraign only
the bare Title of King, he thought fit to strike in at that conjuncture of Affairs, and to
that end left Zocotora upon the 20. of August, and having in a very few dayes taken in the
Cities of Calaate, Curiate, Mascate, Soar, and Orfassam, he took his march directly to
the principal City, to which he came the 25. of September. The first thing he did, was
to defeat a very strong Fleet, which the Moors had within the Haven, and by that means

oblig'd the King to come to a capitulation, by which the King of Ormus promised to take
the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity to the King of Portugal; to pay him every year fifteen
thousand Ducats as a Tribute, in Gold, Silver or Pearls, and five thousand towards the
charges of the present War; and to permit Albuquerque to build a Cittadel where he
should think most convenient for the preservation of the City.
               The Portuguez began the said Cittadel on the 25. of October following, and gave it the
name of Our Blessed Lady of Victory. It is true, this establishment was not so absolute at
the beginning, but that the Moors made some attempts to rid themselves of these new
Guests: but the Portuguez made a shift to maintain what they had gotten, and to make
the place they were in a Magazine of Armes for the Indies; taking occasion by that means
to engross all the Commerce to themselves, and obliging all the Persians and Arabians to
buy of them all those Commodities which they stood in need of from the Indians. Nay,
this was so rigorously observed, that the Governour of Ormus prohibited the Inhabitants
to sell any of their Commodities, till such time as he had sold his own. The permitted
Seyfadin to live in the Island, but at a certain place far enough from the Cittadel, so not to
give the Portuguez any occasion of jealousie. Scach Abas, King of Persia, being no longer
able to endure the insolence of the Portuguez, and very much incens'd at their receiving
into Protection the Gentlemen of the House of the Gabrieli, whom we have spoken of
elsewhere, bethought himself of some course to get these Forreigners out of those parts.
To effect this, he address'd himself to the English, who traded at Ormus; and by the advantageous
proffers that he made, oblig'd them to promise him all the assistance they could
to carry on the siege of that City, which was aaulted and taken by the English, in the year
1622. They put both the City and Cittadel into the hands of the King of Persia, who
found in it six hundred great Guns, some Iron, some Brass, which Scach Abas caused to be
transported to Laar and Ispahan, all but fourscore Pieces, which he left in the Cittadel;
He caused the walls of the City to be demolish'd, and the Materials thereof to be translated
to Gamron, which began even at that time to raise it self upon the ruines of its Neighbours.
The King of Persia, desirous to reward the services which the English had done
him upon that occasion, did not only grant them an absolute exemption from all Impositions,
but he also bestow'd on them one moyety of those Duties which other Merchants
were to pay there; but, as we said before, the English come very far short of receiving what
is due to them.
               I found in the Port of Gamron an English Ship called the Swan, of 300. Tun, carrying
24. Guns. Master Honywood, Agent for the Affairs of England, recommended me to the
Captain of it, and commanded him to carry me over to the Indies, and to defray all my
charges till I came to Suratta. I had brought eight Horses with me, making account to
sell them with very great advantage in the Indies; but the Ship was so full of Goods, that
it was with much ado that I could get in only two of them: So that I was forc'd to
put off the other six, to very great loss, as being able to get but thirty pound for those
which had cost me sixty pound at Ispahan, and which I should have sold at above one hundred
and fifty pound at Suratta.
               I embark'd the sixth of April,APRIL. with Mr. Manley and Mr. Hall, English Merchants, whom
the President of the English at Suratta had ordered to come from Ispahan,Mandelslo embarks for Suratta: about some business
concerning the Company, and went aboard accompanied by most of the Strangers
that were at Gamron, as also many Indian Merchants, with whom I had upon some
occasions made acquaintance. The Captain ordered four Pieces to be fired at our coming
aboard, and received us with much civility, inviting us, it being then about noon, to dine
with him.
               We went from Gamron to Suratta in nineteen dayes, during which the Captain treated
me very magnificently, and did me the honour to resign his own bed to me, and to give me
precedence upon all occasions. He was well furnished with Fowl, Mutton, and other fresh
Meat, but above all things, with excellent good Sack, English Beer, French Wines, Arak,
and other refreshments; which prov'd so well for me, that by the help of these good Cordials,
and the benefit I had by the drinking of Ptizanne, which I caused to be made with
Cinnamon and rinds of Pomegranats, at my arrival at Suratta, I found my health
perfectly recover'd, though I must also acknowledge, as much contributing thereto, my
using of Th??, to which I had so accustomed my self, that I ordinarily took it twice or
thrice a day.
               The contrary wind prevented our departure the day that we came aboard, so that we lay
at Anchor all the night following; and the next day, being the seventh, we set sail, taking
our course towards the Isle of Ormus: but towards night there rose so great a tempest, together
with a West-wind, that to avoid running upon the shore, we were forced to cast Anchor
in sight of the Isle.
               
                  
Sunday, being the eighth, we laveer'd it with a West-wind, endeavouring to pass between
the Isles of Ormus and Kismich, which are four Leagues distant one from the other.
About two in the afternoon, we cast over-board the body of a young Sea-man, who died
of the Bloudy-flux two dayes before. This Ceremony, which I had not seen before, put
me into so much the greater fright, in that being still troubled with the same disease, I imagined
they would shortly do as much by me.
               The night following we pass'd in sight of the two Islands we spoke of last, to wit, Ormus
and Kismich; and the next day, being the ninth, we discovered the Continent of Arabia,
taking our course along the Coast, which is thereabouts, without any danger.
               Tuesday 10. A calm staid us at the same place, and the 11. we put off from the Coasts
of Arabia, to make towards those of Persia, which we still kept in sight of till Thursday
night, April 12. Then a good West-north-west wind rising, we took our course towards
the East-south-east, at 25. degrees, 50. minutes elevation.
               Friday morning, we could perceive no Land, but had sight of a Pirate, who by his making
ever and anon more or less sail, discover'd he had somewhat to say to us. One while he
came somewhat near us; another, he kept at a great distance; but at last??? perceiving we
made it our business to get the wind of him, he made towards the Isle of Zocotora.
               This Island is seated at 21. degrees 40. minutes,The scituation and description of the Island of Zocotora. at the entrance of the Red-sea, having
towards the South-west, and North-east, the Country of Melinda or Aethiopia, and towards
the South Arabia, from which it is distant about sixteen Leagues. It is about 25. Leagues
in length, but not above ten in breadth, having on all sides very good riding for Ships, and
safe Harbours. It is indifferently well peopled, and is subject to the King of Arabia, under
whom it is governed by a Sulthan.
               The Inhabitants are of low stature,Its Inhabitants. and rather lean then fat, of a duskish complexion,
and very laborious. Their only sustenance is Fish and Fruits, living very temperately.
They treat their Wives, whom they buy in Arabia, with much civility, and have a certain
respect for them; but will not permit Strangers to see them. They are very crafty in their
trading, and delight much in it, though they have but few things to sell. And whereas
they adulterate almost all their Commodities, they are accordingly distrustful of those
which are brought to them.
               They reduce Dates into a paste, and it serves them instead of Bread. The Island affords
very few Oranges, and those not very good, Tobacco, and Citruls. There are also some Cocos-trees,
but not many, the fruit not coming to ripeness there, by reason the ground is very
full of stones.
               Their main wealth consists in Aloes,The Aloes of Zocotora. the juyce whereof they gather in bladders, or Goatsskins;
and dry it in the Sun. They have also the gummy juyce called Dragons-bloud, and
Civet, which may be bought there at about three or four Crowns an Ounce: but those
who are not very well skill'd in that Drug are many times cheated; for the Inhabitants of
the Island put Grease and other nasty stuff into it. They keep abundance of Civet-cats
about their houses, but they have very little tame Fowl; wild none at all. They have
Camels, Asses, Oxen, Cows, Sheep and Goats, whose hair about the thighs is curl'd much
after the manner that Satyrs are painted. The Town where the Sulthan hath his residence
is called Tamary, and hath in it a Fort, which is distant from the Sea about a Canon-shot,
with four Guns.
               Their Arms are a kind of broad Swords,Teir Arms. whereof the hilt is very large, but without any
guard. In their Girdles they wear also Poniards, the blades whereof are above three fingers
broad towards the handle, but very sharp towards the point. They are so curious, as
to have something of Silver or Copper about the handles, but their Fire-arms are not well
kept, and yet they are very expert at the handling of them, as they are also in mannaging
those little Bucklers, wherewith they defend themselves in fight.
               Ships may take in fresh water there without any trouble, for the waters which come
from the Mountains fall into the Sea like a River. They have no other Boats then such
as are absolutely flat-bottom'd, which they make use of in their fishing, which is very
good thereabouts. They have this common with the Arabians and other Mahumetans,
that they eat no Swines flesh; but even in Tamary it self there is no Mosquey, nor any
other place for them to meet at to do their Devotions. These they do morning and evening,
at the rising and setting of the Sun, to which they make very low reverences, and
mutter certain words between their teeth; this they do also three or four times a day
besides.
               
                  The 14. of April, we were at 23. degrees, 24. minutes.
                  The 15. at 22. degrees, 40. minutes.
                  The 16. at 22. degrees, 40. min.
                  
                     
The 17. at 21. degrees, 55. minutes. This day the Captain of our Ship fell
sick of a burning Feayer.
                  The 18. at 21. degrees, 8. minutes.
                  The 19. at 20. deg. 42. min.
                  The 20. at 20. deg. 50. min.
                  The 22. at 29. deg. 50. min.
                  The 23. at 20. degrees, 18. minutes latitude.
               
               The 25. of April,Comes to Surat. we came before the City of Surat, and cast Anchor two
Leagues from Land, by reason it being the Captains intention not to stay there above three
or four dayes, he would be sure of the convenience of parting thence when he pleas'd. Besides,
there is no Road along that Coast where Ships can lye with any safety, from May to
September, by reason of the continual Tempests and furious winds which reign there during
that time; whereas on the Eastern Coast of the Indies, in the Gulf of Bengala, it is
fair and calm at that time.
               The year is divided into three very different seasons;The year bath there but three Seasons. for in the moneths of February,
March, April and May, it is extreamly hot weather; in Iune, Iuly, August and September,
there is nothing but continual Rains, with Thunder and Lighting; and the moneths
of October, November, December and Ianuary, are cold, at least as far as is consistent with
the Climate.
               April 26. The Captin sent one to the President of the English at Surat, to give him
notice of his Arrival. The President sent him back the 28. accompanied by two young
Merchants of the same Nation, who brought Orders to the Captain, and in the Presidents
name intreated me to come with the soonest to Surat, where he should make good in effect
those proffers which they were then come to make to me of his service. Having acknowledged
the Captain's civility by a small Present, and leaving him very sick, and much troubled
at our separation, after the friendship we had contracted together, I left the Ship the
29. of April.
               Within a League of the Road we entred into the River upon which Surat is seated,
and which hath on both sides a very fertile soil, and many fair Gardens, with pleasant
Country-houses, which being all white, a colour it seems the Indians are much in love
with, afford a noble prospect amidst the greeness whereby they are encompassed. But
this River, which is the Tapte, called by others Tynde, is so shallow at the mouth of it,
that Barks of 70. or 80. Tun can hardly come into it. We came ashore near the Sulthan's
Palace, and went immediately to the Custom-house to have our things search'd by
the Officers there: which is done with such exactness in this place, that they think it not
enough to open Chests and Portmantles, but examine peoples clothes and pockets. The
Sulthan or Governour, nay the Customers themselves, oblige Merchants and Passengers
to part with, at the price they shall think fit to put upon them, those Goods and Commodities
which they had brought for their own private use. Accordingly the Sulthan himself,
who came to the Custom-house as soon as we were got thither, having found among
my things a bracelet of yellow Amber, and a Diamond, would needs buy them both of
me: whereto when I made him answer, that I was no Merchant, and that I valued
those things, only for their sakes who had bestow'd them on me, he was pleas'd to return
me the Diamond, but detain'd the Bracelet, telling me I should have it again when I honour'd
him with a Visit.
               While we were in this contestation, came to the place an Indian Coach, drawn by two
white Oxen, which the English President had sent to bring me to their House; so that
leaving the Sulthan with the Bracelet, I went into it. At the entrance of the House I
met the President, with his second, that is to say, he who commands under him, and in
his absence, whose name was Mr. Fremling, who received me with extraordinary kindness,
and very civilly answer'd the Complement I made them, upon the freedom I took to
make my advantage thereof. The President, who spoke Dutch very well, told me I was
very welcome; that in the Country where we then were, all Christians were oblig'd to
assist one another, and that he was the more particularly oblig'd thereto as to what concern'd
me, in respect of the affection I would have express'd towards some of his Nation
at Ispahan. He thereupon brought me to his Chamber, where there was a Collation ready.
It consisted of Fruits and Preserves, according to the custom of the Country. As
soon as we were set, he asked me what my design was, and understanding that I intended
to return for Germany within twelve moneths, he told me I was come too late to get away
that year, by reason no more Ships would come that way, but that if I would stay
with him five or six moneths, till there were a convenience of passage, he would take it
kindly: that during that time, he would contribute all he could to my divertisement:

                  
                  

                  
                  
that he would find out a means how I might see the most eminent places in the Country,
nay, that he would send some of his own Nation along with me, who should find me those
accommodations I could not otherwise hope for. This obliging discourse soon prevail'd
with me to accept of these proffers, so that the he shew'd me all the house, that I might make
choice of a convenient Lodging, which I took near his Seconds Chamber. In the evening,
some Merchants and others, belonging to the President, came and brought me from
my Chamber to supper into a great Hall, where was the Minister with about a dozen Mernts,
who kept me company, but the President and his Second supp'd not, as being
 stom'd to that manner of life, out of a fear of overcharging their Stomachs, digestion
being slowly performed, by reason of the great heats which are as troublesome there in
the night time as in the day. After Supper the Minister carried me into a great open Gallery,
where I found the President and his Second taking the coolness of the Sea-Air. This
was the place of our ordinary rendezvous, where we met every night; to wit, the President,
his Second, the principal Merchant, the Minister and my self; but the other Merchants
came not but when they were invited by the President. At dinner he kept a great
Table, of about fifteen or sixteen dishes of Meat, besides the Desert.
               The respect and deference which the other Merchants have for the President was very
remarkable,The respect the English at Surat have for their President. as also the order which was there observed in all things, especially at Divine
Service, which was said twice a day, in the morning at six, and at eight at night, and on
Sundayes thrice. No person in the house but had his particular Function, and their certain
hours assign'd them as well for work as recreation. Our divertisement was thus ordered.Their divertisement???
On Fridayes after Prayers, there was a particular Assembly, at which met with us
three other Merchants, who were of kin to the President, and had left as well as he their
Wives in England, which day being that of their departure from England, they had appointed
it for to make a commemoration thereof, and drink their Wives healths. Some
made their advantage of this meeting to get more then they could well carry away, though
every man was at liberty to drink what he pleas'd, and to mix the Sack as he thought fit,
or to drink Palepuntz, which is a kind of drink consisting of Aqua vitae, Rose-water, juice
of Citrons and Sugar.
               At our ordinary meetings every day, we took only Th??, which is commonly used all
over the Indies, not only among those of the Country, but also among the Dutch and
English, who take it as a Drug that cleaness the Stomach, and digests the superfluous humours,
by a temperate heat particular thereto. The Persians instead of Th??; drink their
Kahwa, which cools and abates the natural heat which Th?? preserves.
               The English have a fair Garden without the City, whither we constantly went on Sundayes
after Sermon, and sometimes also on other dayes of the week, where our Exercise
was shooting at Butts, at which I made a shift to get a hundred Mamoudis (or five
pound sterling) every week. After these divertisements, we had a Collation of Fruit
and Preserves, and bath'd our selves in a Tanke or Cistern which had five foot water,
where some Dutch Gentlewomen serv'd and entertain'd us with much civility. What
troubled me most was, that my little acquaintance with the English Tongue made me incapable
of Conversation, unless it were with the President, who spoke Dutch.
               But before I relate what happened to me in this Voyage, and what I saw during my stay
at Surat, it will not be amiss, to give here a general, but short description, of the Mogul's
Country, and the Provinces whereof it consists; so to make the readier way for what we
shall have to say of it hereafter.
               The Country properly called India,A general description of indosthan. which the Persians and Arabians name Indosthan,
reaches, on the West-side, from the River Indus or Sindo, and the Kingdom of the same
name (the Inhabitants whereof are called Abint, or from the Frontiers of the Kingdom
of Maecon, which some call Gelsche Macquerona, whereof the Inhabitants are Baloches,
or Baluches) as far as Ganges. The Ancients called this Province Carmania, and it hath
a Port or Haven called Guader, at 25. degrees on this side the line. The Persians and
Arabians call the Kingdom of Sindo Diul. The same Persians, and the Indosthans call the
River Indus, Pangab, that is to say, five waters, because so many Rivers come into it before
it falls into the Sea under that famous name. The first is that of Bugal, or Begal, which
rises near Kabul. The second is called Chanab, and rises in the Province of Quesmir or
Cassimier, fifteen dayes journey above Lahor, towards the North. The third is that of
Ravy, or Ravee, which runs by Lahor, and rises not far from it. The two others, viz.
Via and Osuid or Sind, come from a great distance, and meet near Bakar, which lies at an
equal distance between Lahor and the Sea. Whence it is to be inferr'd, that those Geographers
are in an errour, who put this River at 24. degrees on this side the Line, and
confound it with that which runs by Diul. Some say the great Mogul's Kingdom is of so

vast an extent, that a Caravan would have much ado to travel through it in two years; but
these are Fables. Its certain Frontiers, according to the description of Edward Terrin,
are on the East-side, the Kingdom of Mavy; on the West, part of Persia and the South-Sea;
on the North, Mount Caucasus and great Tartaria; and on the South, the Kingdom
of Decan and the Gulf of Bengala, containing thirty and seven great Provinces, which
were heretofore so many Kingdoms: to wit,
               Candahar,Its Provinces. which takes its name from, or derives it to the chief City, is the most Western
Province of all the Indies, and lies upon the Territories of the King of Persia, who hath
several times been Master of it.1. Candahar. It is indeed for this Province, that the Kings of Persia
are in continual war almost with the great Mogul; as they are in Turkey side for Badgat
and Ervan.
               The Province of Kabul,2. Kabul. which is no doubt the richest of all the Kingdom, derives its
name also from the Capital City, and hath for Frontier on the North-side great Tartary.
In this Province rises the River Nibal, which changes its name into that of Begal, and falls
into the Indus, as we said before. It is conceived by some, that this is the Coa, or the Suastus
of Ptolomy.
               The Province of Multan owes its name also to the principal City,3. Multan. and is seated along
the River Indus, having on the West-side the Kingdom of Persia, and the Province of
Candahar.
               The Province of Haca-chan,4. Haca-chan. or Hangi-chan, lies towards the East, and hath on the West
the River Indus. It is called also the Kingdom of Balochy, as we shall express elsewhere;
but it hath no considerable City.
               Bachar,5. Bachar. or Buckar, the chief City whereof is called Bacherhukon, lies also along the River
Indus, which divides it in the middle, and makes it one of the most fertile Provinces in the
Kingdom. It hath on the South-south-west-side, the Province of Tatta, and towards the
West, the people called the Bolaches, a cruel and warlike Nation.
               The Province of Tatta, which hath also its name from the chief City, is divided into
several Isles by the River Indus.6. Tatta. This Province hath the reputation of having the most
industrious Tradesmen of all the Kingdom.
               Soret is a small Province,7. Soret. but very well peopled. Its chief City is Iangar; and it reaches
Eastward to the Province of Guzarata, and Westward to the Sea.
               The Province of Iselmere hath but one City in it of the same name,8. Iselmere. and hath for Frontiers
Westward, the Provinces of Soret, Bachar, and Tatta.
               That of Attach,9. Attach. and its capital City, from which it is so called, are seated upon the River
Nibal, which coming from the West, falls into the Indus, which divides it from the Province
of Haca-chan.
               The Province of Pang-ab is one of the greatest,10. Peng-ab. most fertile, and most considerable of all
the Kingdom. The five Rivers we spoke of, which pass through it, give it that name.
Lahor is the chief City thereof.
               The Province of Chismer,11. Chismer. or Quexmer, the chief City whereof is called Syranakar, is
seated upon the River Bezat, or Badt, which makes a great number of Isles in this Province,
and after a great compass falls into the Ganges. It touches some part of the Province
of Kabul, and is cold enough by reason of its Mountains, though it may be affirm'd,
that in comparison of the Kingdom of Tliebet, which is as it were its Frontiers on the Eastside,
it is very temperate. About eight Cos (which make four Leagues) from the chief
City, in the midst of a Lake which is three miles about, there is a little Isle, where the Mogul
hath built a very fair House, for the convenience of hunting the wild Goose. All along
the River which runs through the middle of this Lake, there is a kind of tree, whose
leaves are like that of a Chesnut, but the wood, which is somewhat of a brownish colour,
is checquer'd with small streaks of several colours, which makes it much sought after by
persons of Quality.
               The Province of Chismer hath on the East-side that of Bankisch,12. Bankisch. the chief City whereof
is Beibar, or Beithus,
               The Province of Iengapar,13. Jengapar. or Iemipar, so called from its chief City, lies between the
Cities of Lahor and Agra.
               The Province of Ienba,14. Jenba. or Iamba, which hath also its name from the Metropolis thereof,
hath on the West-side, the Province of Pang-ab, and is very hilly all over.
               The Province of Delly,15. Delly. and its chief City of the same name, lies between Ienba and
Agra, towards the source of the River Gemini, by some called Semana, which passing by
the City of Agra, falls into the Ganges. The chief City of Delly is very ancient, and was
sometime the Metropolis of all Indosthan, as may be seen by the ruines of its palace, and
other magnificent Structures.
               
                  
The Province of Bando,16. Bando. and its Metropolis of the same name, hath on the West-side, the
City of Agra.
               The Province of Malway,17. Malway or Malwa, is very fertile, its chief City Ratipore, though Thomas
Row, an English Gentleman, calls it Vgen. The River Cepra, upon which is seated the
City of Calleada, the ordinary residence of the ancient Kings of Mandoa, passes within half
a League of it, and disembogues it self into the Sea, by the Gulf of Cambaia.
               The Province of Chitor was heretofore a very considerable Kingdom,18. Chitor. but the Metropolis
from which it derives its name, and whereof the walls were heretofore six Leagues
about, is now so ruin'd, that there is to be seen but the Relicks of what it hath been, with
the sad remainders of its sumptuous Mosquies, and magnificent Palaces. The great Mogul,
Achabar, great Grand-father of Schach Chiram, reduc'd it to that condition, and conquer'd
it from one of the Successours of Rana, who forc'd to make his escape came to a
capitulation with him, and acknowledg'd the Soveraignty of the Mogul, in the year
1614. This Province hath on the East-side that of Candisch, and on the South, that of
Gusuratta.
               The Province of Gusuratta,19. Gusuratta. which the Portuguez call the Kingdom of Cambaya, upon
the account of its chief City, where they have their main trading, is without all question
the noblest and most powerful of all the Mogul's Country. Its Metropolis seated in the
midst of the Province, is called Hamed-ewad, that is to say, the City of King Hamed, who
built it. It is now corruptly called Amadavat, or Amadabat, whereof we shall have occasion
to speak more at large hereafter.
               The Province of Candisch,20. Candisch. the Metropolis whereof, Bursampour, or Brampour, was heretofore
the ordinary residence of the Kings of Decan, before the Great Mogul united it to his
Crown, is very large, and well peopled. The River Tabet, or Tapte, which falls into the Sea
by the Gulf of Cambaya, divides it from the Country of the Prince of Partapha, who is also
a Vassal of the Great Moguls.
               The Province of Berar,21. Berar. whereof the Metropolis is Shapore, or Shaspour, reaches Southward,
and touches that of Gusuratta, and the Mountain of Rana.
               In the Province of Gualor,22. Gualor. or Gualier, which hath its name from the chief City, there is
a Cittadel, wherein the Mogul confines such as are Prisoners of State, and those Lords, of
whose carriage he conceives any jealousie, and keeps there also some part of his Treasure,
and abundance of Gold and Silver.
               The Province of Agra,23. Agra. which derives its name to the Metropolis thereof, which is not
very ancient, is at present the chiefest of all the Mogul's Country, according to the account
we shall give of it hereafter.
               The Province of Sambel,24. Sambel. or Sambel, so called from its Metropolis, is divided from that of
Narvar by the River Gemini, which falls into Ganges near the City of Halebasse, where
these two Rivers meeting make a kind of an Isle: Whence some have taken occasion to
call this Province Doab, that is to say, between two waters; as if one should say, Mesopotamia,
or Interaquas.
               The Province of Bakor lies on the West-side of the Ganges,25. Bakor. its chief City is called
Bikameer.
               The Province of Narvar,26. Narvar the Metropolis whereof is call Gehud, hath running through
it a most noble River, which falls into the Ganges.
               The Province of Nagracut,27. Nagracut. or Nakarkut, is one of the most Northerly Provinces of the
Mogul's Country. In the chief City thereof from which it hath the name, there is to be
seen, in a sumptuous Chappel, the floor whereof is covered with plates of Gold, the Effigies
of an Animal, or rather a Monster, called Matta, which brings thither every year a
great number of Indians, who go to do their devotions there, and offer unto it a little snip
which they cut out of their own tongues. In this same Province is the City of Kalamaka,
famous for its Pilgrimages, which are the more frequent there, by reason of the
flames cast forth by the cold Springs as they come out of the Rock, which flames the Inhabitants
adore.
               The Province of Siba,28. Siba??? whereof the Metropolis is Hardwari, gives its rise to the River
Ganges. The Inhabitants of the Country imagine, that the Rock out of which it issues
hath a Cows head, for which Beast they have a certain veneration, and that there is somewhat
divine in that production. Whence it comes that they bathe themselves every day
in the River. This Province is no less mountainous then that of Nakarkut, though it be
not so much towards the North.
               Kakares,2 Kakares??? the principal Cities whereof are Dankaler and Binsola, is a very spacious
Province, but very full of Mountains. Mount Caucasus lies between it and
Tartaria.
               
                  
The Province of Gor,3. Gor. which hath its name from the chief City, is also full of Mountains,
and gives its rise to the River Perselis, which falls into the Ganges.
               The Province of Pitan,31. Pitan. or Partan, and its chief City, which gives it the name, hath running
through them the River Kanda, which also falls into the Ganges. This is also a very
mountainous Province, and hath on the West of it that of Iamba.
               The River Iderclis divides the Province of Kanduana,32. Kanduana. the chief City whereof is Karaeh,
by some called Katene, from that of Pitan. This Province, and that of Gor, are the further-most
of the Mogul's territories towards the North.
               The Province of Porena is as fruitful as the two last named are barren.33. Porena It lies between
the Rivers of Ganges, Perselis, Gemini and Candach, and is so called from its chief City.
               The City of Rajapore,34. Jewal. or Reyapor, is the Metropolis of the Province of Iewal.
               The Province of Meuat,35. Meuat. the chief City whereof is called Narnol, is a Country barren
enough, reaching from the Ganges Eastward.
               The Province of Voessa,36. Voessa. or Voeza, the chief City whereof is Iascanat, is the uttermost
Province of the Mogul's Kingdom towards the East.
               The Province of Bengala may no doubt be numbred amongst the most powerful of all
the Country,37. Bengala. giving its name to the Gulf, into which the Ganges disembogues it self by four
several channels, or mouths. Its principal Cities are Raymebel, Kaka, or Daeca, Philipatan
and Satigam. It is subdivided into many other lesser Provinces, the most considerable
whereof are Puna, and Palan, from which several Kings have not thought it much to assume
their Titles.
               Texeira, in his description of Persia, speaking of certain Provinces of the Indies, names
that of Vtrat, with its chief City, but he only names it, without giving any account of its
scituation. He speaks also of the Kingdom of Caeche, and sayes it is considerable for the
Race-horses it breeds, near Cambaya, towards the North: but certainly, it is no other then
the Province of Candisch, before spoken of.
               The extent of the Mogul's Country,The extent of the Mogul's Country. from East to West, is about six hundred Leagues,
and from North to South, about seven hundred French Leagues, since its uttermost
Frontiers towards the South are at twenty, and the furthermost towards the North at forty
three degrees.
               As concerning the Province of Gusuratta,A description of the Kingdom of Gususatta. which the Portuguez, improperly, call Cambaya,
it lies all along the Sea-side, extending it self much like a Peninsula into the Sea, and
having on both sides a Gulf or Bay, one whereof is eight Leagues broad at the entrance,
and grows narrower and narrower for forty Leagues thence. The Land extends it self
Westward along the Sea-coast, and Northward it hath the Provinces of Soret, Quismer and
Bando; Eastward, those of Chitor and Kandish, and Southward the Kingdom of Decan.
Heretofore its Frontiers reach'd along the Sea-coast, as far as Gualor, eight dayes journey
beyond Amadabat, and Southward as far as Daman.
               But though its extent be not so vast at present as it hath been,Its extent. yet it is now a very great
Province, it being certain that it reaches above sixscore Leagues along the Sea-coast, and
comprehends above twenty thousand Cities, Towns, and inhabited Villages; besides the
places which were laid desolate some years since by War or Famine. Its principal Cities,
most whereof are Maritime,Its principal Cities. are Surat, Broitschia, Gandeer, Goga, Cambaya, Diu, Patepatane,
Mangalor, Gondore, Nassary, Gandivi, Balsara, or Belsera. The City of Hamed-Ewad,
or Amadabat, which is the Metropolis of the Province, is at a great distance from the
Sea.
               The principal Rivers of this Province are the Nadabat,Its Rivers. which passes by Broitschia,
the Tapta, and the Wasset; besides these conveniences, it hath two of the best Ports in
all the Indies,Its Ports. which are that of the Com of Suhaly; to wit, that of Surat and that of
Cambaia.
               There is no Province in all the Indies more fertile then Gusuratta,Its Fertility. nor any that affords
more Fruits and Provisions, which grow in such abundance there, that all the neighbouring
Provinces are thence suppli'd: 'Tis true indeed, that in the year 1640. the great
drought, and the year following, the continual rains reduced it to so deplorable a condition,
that the particular account might be given thereof would deprive the Reader of the
diversion, which it is our design to find him in this Relation. But the Province hath since
that time well recover'd it self of that desolation, yet not so as but the marks of it may
be seen every where. But to prosecute our Relation, as to what happened to me during
my stay at Surat.
               While I was at Ispahan,The Relation continued. having fixt my resolution to travel into the Indies, I took into
my service a Persian, who was to serve me as an Interpreter for the Turkish and Persian
Languages, which I then began a little to understand. He was born of Christian Parents,

his father and mother having been of those whom Scach-Abas had caused to be
translated from Georgia to Ispahan, where his brethren then lived in good rank. Which
considerations oblig'd me to treat him with the greater civility, and to promise him by
way of wages four Crowns a moneth. He had made me believe that his engaging himself
into my service was partly out of this respect, that he might thereby have the convenience
of re-imbracing the Christian Religion: but he had no sooner made his first acquaintances
at Surat, ere he understood, that an Uncle of his by the Mother-side could
raise him to great fortunes at the Mogul's Court, where he was Master of the Horse. Upon
this intelligence, he soon took a resolution to leave me, and to desire the protection of
the Sulthan, who kept him a while at his own house, and afterwards sent him to Agra. I
was the more startled at this departure of the young fellow, the more it run in my
thoughts, that knowing all the particulars of our engagement with the Indian Embassadour
at Ispahan, his design might be to betray me into the hands of my enemies. And certainly,
had I known of his going to Agra, I should not have had the confidence to take
that place in my way: though it might appear, by what happened afterwards, that God
sent him to that place expresly to save my life, since, had it not been for him, I might have
lost it there.
               In May,MAY. there came news to Surat, that the Chan, who commanded at Candahar for the
King of Persia,The Governour of Candahar delivers up his place to the Mogul. had revolted, and had rendred the place to the Mogul, upon this account,
that the Scach had threatned to put him to death. The Mogul sent immediately 500000.
Crowns to the place, as a requital for the Governours service, and to pay the Garrison,
which had revolted along with him. Alymerdan-Chan, Governour of the same place,
had done such another trick at the beginning of Schach-Sefis Reign, who would needs
oblige him to bring his head to Court, which if he had done, he had never carried it away
again upon his shoulders. Soon after Scach recover'd Candahar again; and it was partly
upon this account, that the Mogul had sent to him the Embassadour I spoke of before,
though among his other Instructions, he had order to demand the Myrsa Polagi, his
Nephew.
               Iune 16.JVNE. I went out a hunting with a young Dutch Merchant, and another English
Merchant, with whom having cross'd the River, they brought me to an old ruin'd City,
called Reniel, where the Dutch have a Ware-house. The Inhabitants of this City are called
Naites, and are for the most part either Mariners or Trades-men, and of the Mahumetan
Religion. The streets of it are narrow, and the houses so rais'd from the foundation,
that there is not any but hath one step to get up to it. There we staid all night, and were
nobly treated by the Merchants, who had the management of the Trade there.
               The next day we went to a Village called Bodick, and in our way let fly at a wild Duck
and a Heron; there we saw about twenty Deers. Their skins which were somewhat
greyish, were checkquer'd all over with white spots, and they had fair Horns, with several
Brow-ancklers. There was among them a sort of creatures about the bigness of our Ro-Bucks,
the Skins whereof were inclining to a dark brown, checkquer'd also with white
spots, having very graceful Horns. Some are of opinion, that these are the same that Aldrovandus
calls Cervi-capras, and that it is from this kind of Beast that we have Bezoar.
We went thence to another Village, called Damre, where we saw abundance of wild Ducks
in the Rice, whereof there grows great store in those parts. All the fields have a little
ascent raised about them to keep in the water, the Rice requiring much moisture. In this
Village we found some Terry,Terry, of Palm-Wine. which is a Liquor drawn out of the Palm-trees, and drunk of
it in Cups made of the leaves of the same Tree. To get out the Juyce, they go up to the top of
the Tree, where they make an incision in the bark, and fasten under it an earthen pot, which
they leave there all night, in which time it is fill'd with a certain sweet Liquor very pleasant
to the taste. They get out some also in the day time, but that corrupts immediately,
and is good only for Vinegar, which is all the use they make of it.
               The City of Surat,Suratta described. or Suratta, lies at 21. degrees 42. minutes upon the River Tapta,
which rises near Barampour, and falls into the Sea four Leagues below the City. It lies all
along the River side, and is built four-square. It hath no wall to the River side, but on the
Land side it hath a good Rampier of Stone, and a Castle all of Free-stone.
               The City hath three Gates,Its Gates. whereof one goes towards the Village of Brion, where those
who go to Cambaya and Amadabat cross the River; another goes to Barampour; and
the third to Nassary.Its Houses. All the Houses are flat, as those of Persia, and most have very fair
Gardens.
               The Castle,The Castle??? which they say was built by the Turks, upon an Invasion which they made
into this Country, hath but one Gate, which looks into a spacious Plain which serves for a
Meidan to the City. Not far thence, and at the entrance of the City, stands the Governours

Palace and the Custom-house, and near them the Bazar, as well for forreign Merchants
as those of the City. The Governour of the Castle hath no dependance on him of
the City, whose business it is to look after the administration of Justice, and the payment
of the Customs at the Exportation and Importation of all Merchandises, which pay three
and a half in the hundred, except it be Gold and Silver, whether coined, or in wedges, or
made into bars, which pay but two in the hundred.
               The Dutch and English have their Houses there which they call Lodges, and are spacious
and well built, consisting of many fair Appartments, Lodgings, Chambers, fair Halls, Galleries
and Chappels.
               The Haven of Suratta is two Leagues from the City,The Port. The Kom of Suhaly. at the Village of Suhaly, whence
the Dutch and English call it the Kom of Suhaly. There Ships are unladen of their Commodities,
which are brought thence to Suratta by Land. This Road lies at 21. degrees,
50. minutes, upon the course of North-east and South-west. The entrance into it is not
very broad, since that at high-water there is but seven fathom water, and at low but five.
The Haven it self is not above 500. paces broad before the Village, sandy at the bottom,
and most of the banks are bare and dry at low-water, and so sharp and steepy, that sounding
there is to no purpose at all. 'Tis very safe riding, there being no danger of any wind
but that of the South-west. But from May to September there is no staying on those
Coasts, by reason of the winds and tempests, accompany'd by extraordinary thunder and
lightning, which reign there during all that time.
               The Inhabitants of Surat are either Benjans, Bramans, or Moguls. These last are Mahumetans,The Inhabitants.
and much better look'd on then the others, as well upon the account of their
Religion, which they have common with the Great Mogul, and the chiefest Lords of the
Country, as upon that of the profession they make to bear Arms. They have an aversion
for Trades and Merchandise, and had rather serve, then engage themselves in any honourable
employment: for if they can but once get to be Masters of a Horse, they court Fortune
no further, and immediately list themselves in the service of their Prince. The Benjans
on the contrary, are a reserv'd people and laborious, and apply themselves to Trades and
Merchandise, and have an extraordinary devotion for the things that concern Religion; as
we shall have occasion to insist on more at large hereafter.
               There are also in the City some Arabians, Persians, Armenians, Turks and Iews, who
either have their habitations there, or trade thither; but there are no Forreigners so considerable
for their settlement there as the Dutch and English. They have there their Lodges,
their Store-houses, their Presidents, their Merchants, and their Secretaries, and indeed have
made it one of the most eminent Cities for Traffick of all the East.Surat the general Factory of the English Trade. The English particularly
have made it the main place of all their Trading into the Indies, and have established
there a President, to whom the Secretaries of all the other Factories are oblig'd to give an
account. He manages Affairs with the assistance of 20. or 24. Merchants and Officers,
and hath under his superintendency the Factory of Agra, where they have a Secretary accompanied
by six persons; that of Ispahan, where they have a Secretary and seven or eight
other Merchants; that of Mesulipatan, with fifteen; that of Cambay, with four; that of
Amadabat, with six; that of Brodra and Broitscheia, with four; and that of Dabul, with
two persons: who are all oblig'd to come once a year to Suratta, there to give an account
of their Administration to the President.
               The English have also a Factory at Bantam, in the Isle of Iava; but that hath its particular
President, who hath no dependance on that of Suratta, which hinders not but that
he hath a certain deference for him, as have indeed all the English Ships, which perfect not
their Voyage without casting Anchor at Suratta.
               The places about this City are the most delightful of any in the world.The places about Surat. For, besides,
the fair Gardens, where they have all sorts of Fruit-trees, all the Champion seems to want
nothing that might recreate the eye. Among other things, I observ'd there one of those
Trees, whereof I have given a description when I had occasion to speak of the City of
Gamron, as also very many sumptuous Sepulchres built of Marble, and a Tanke or Cistern
made eight-square of Free-stone, having at every angle a pair of stairs to go down into it,
and in the midst, the Sepulchre of the Founder of that magnificent Structure, which is so
spacious, that it contains water enough to supply the whole City, even in the greatest heats
of the year.
               The tempests of Rain begin to cease with the moneth of September.SEPTEMBER. About that time,Two English Ships arrive at Surat.
viz. the 14. of that moneth, news was brought that two English Ships were arrived at the
Port of Subaly. The President would have gone thither in person, but some business he
had with the Governour hindred him; so that he was forc'd to send two of the chiefest
Merchants, who took me along with them. We came to Suhaly about noon, and having

left our Horses in the Village, went aboard one of the Ships, called the Discovery. 'Twas a
Vessel of 600. Tun, having 28. Guns, and 190. Men. Captain Menard, who commanded
her, and the three Merchants who came to the President for Orders, receiv'd us kindly;
and being come directly from England, they told us all they knew of the Affairs of Europe;
which discourse made us pass away the best part of the night pleasantly enough. The next
day we went to the other Vessel, called the Mary, which was 1200. Tun burthen, and carried
48. Guns. She had past by Aden on the Red-Sea, where she had lost her Captain, who
dy'd of sickness. The Merchant, who commanded her instead of the Captain, made us a
reception equal to what we had in the other Ship; and both of them oblig'd us to come
every day to see them, till the President were come, which was not till eight dayes after.
Which hindred not but that we went sometimes a walking, and a hunting, but so as that
we lay every night in one of the Ships.
               As soon as the Commanders heard that the President was come to Suhaly, they went a
shore, and meeting him on the River side, he made a short discourse to them, exhorting
them to shew their fidelity and complyance to their Superiours, during the time they should
stay in the Indies. Which done, he went into the Boat, to go aboard of the first Ship,
where they fir'd twelve Guns at his arrival. After supper, he went along with the whole
company, to the other, where they fir'd sixteen Guns, besides those that were discharg'd at
the drinking of the King of England's health, and those of some other persons of Honour
in that Country. The two dayes following were spent in feasting, at which the Commanders
of the two Ships treated the President, who afterwards return'd to Suratta; but
night overtaking us by the way, we were forc'd to take up our Lodging in the little City
of Reniel.
               The 24. of the same moneth arrived two other Ships,Boldue a Dutch Vessel of 1400 Tun. whereof one was called Boldue, a
Hollander, of 1400. Tun. She came from the City of Batavia in the Isle of Iava, and
was returning for Holland, loaden with Pepper and other Spices: The other was an English
Vessel, call'd the Swan, and had been sent by the Secretary of Mesulipatan into Persia
for Silks; but the contrary winds having kept her four moneths together at Sea, had oblig'd
her to put in at Suratta, whereas the Hollander had in less time made the whole Voyage
from the Texel to the Indies. I again accompany'd the Merchants, who went to the
Port to see their Ships. We went first aboard the Hollander, who receiv'd us very nobly,
and we were shewn all the conveniences of the Vessel, which no doubt was the best contrived,
and the biggest that ever came out of the Ports of Holland. It was twenty foot
longer then the Mary, but not altogether so broad.
               During my abode at Suratta, I wanted for no divertisement; for either I walk'd down
to the Haven, or found company in the City, especially at the Dutch Presidents, who had
his Family there, and with whom it was the easier for me to make acquaintance, in as much
as I could converse with them in my own Language. But understanding that the English
Ships, with which I intended to return into Europe, would not be ready for their departure
under three or four moneths, I resolv'd to take a journey into the Country, to the
Great Mogul's Court, taking my advantage of a Caffila, or Caravan, of thirty Wagons
loaden with Quick-silver, Roens, which is a root that dies red, Spices, and a considerable
sum of Money, which the English were sending to Amadabat. The President had appointed
four Merchants, certain Benjans, twelve English Souldiers, and as many Indians, to
conduct and convoy this small Caravan; so that confident I night undertake this journey
without any danger, (which it had not been safe for me to attempt without this convenience,
by reason of the Rasboutes, and their robberies upon the high-way;) I took the Presidents
advice, and put my self into their company.
               These Rasboutes are a sort of High-way men,Rasboutes. or Tories, who keep in the Mountains between
Brodra and Broitscheia, which are called Champenir, where they have their fortifi'd
places and retreats, wherein they sometimes make their party good against the Mogul himself.
Not long before, he had taken in one of their strongest places, and by that means kept
them a long time in subjection; but they revolted again, and exercised their robberies with
greater cruelty then ever.
               We left Suratta the last of September,Leaves Suratta to go to Amadabat. being accompany'd by the President and some
English Merchants, who having brought us a League out of the City, there took leave of
us. We took our way towards Broitschia, and came to the Village of Briou, or Briauw,
where we cross'd the River. Then, at four Leagues distance from Briou, we pass'd by
Cattodera, which is a ruin'd place, seated upon a River of the same name, and then by
Enklisser, where we soon made a shift to take above thirty wild Ducks, and many other
Water-fowl, wherewith we feasted our people. We also kill'd a Roebuck, and met with
so many Deer and wild Boars, that it was no hard matter for us to get us a good supper,

since the Dutch and English never travel without their Cooks, who dress the Fowl and
what else their Masters kill, which they never fail to do in abundance. The next day we
cross'd a River which is more broad then deep,Comes to Broitschia. before we came to the City of Broitschia,
into which we were no sooner entred, but the English Secretary sent to us to dine with
him, which we did.
               The City of Broitschia is at 21. degrees, 56. minutes, 12. Leagues from Suratta,Broitschia described. and 8.
from the Sea, upon a River falling out of the Mountains, which divide the Kingdom of
Decar from that of Balagatta. It lies upon a pretty high Mountain, having its Walls of
Free-stone, and so well built, that it may be numbred among the strongest places of all the
Indies. On the Land side, it hath two great Gates, and two small Gates towards the
River, by which is brought abundance of Timber for building, which none dare unload
without the Governours express permission. There is a Guard kept in it, as well upon account
of the place it self, which is very considerable, as upon this, that they exact there two
in the hundred upon all Merchandises that pass through it. The City is sufficiently well
peopled, as also its Suburbs, which are divided into two quarters, which they call Poera,
though very few persons of Quality live therein, most of the Inhabitants being only Weavers,
who make of those kinds of Cottons called Bastas, which are finer then any made in
the Province of Gusaratta. All the fields about this City lie flat and even, unless it be
that about five or six Leagues from it, towards the South-west, may be seen the Mountains
called Pindatshce, which reach as far as Barampour and beyond it, and are very fertile, as
is also all the rest of the Country, which brings forth Rice, Wheat, Barly, and Cotton in
abundance. It is out of these Mountains that the Agat is gotten, whereof are made such
noble drinking Cups, Seals, Handles of Knives and Daggers, and several other rarities,
which are commonly to be bought at Cambays.
               The jurisdiction of the City of Broitschia extends it self over 84. Villages, the Demesne
whereof belongs to it, but heretofore its territory comprehended three other Cities,
who have now their particular Governours. Four Leagues below the City, the River
divides it self into two branches, which there make an Isle near half a League about, below
which it falls into the Sea, by two several channels. It hath no Port, but only a Road,
which is so much the more dangerous, in that the Ships, which may indeed anchor there at
seven fathom water, lie open to the mercy of all Winds.
               Eight Leagues from Broitschia,Indico. upon the way of Cambaya, there is a great Village called
Ianbaysar, or Iambouser, where abundance of Indico is made: and upon the Road to Amadabat,
there is to be seen the Sepulchre of a Mahumetan Saint, named Pollemedory, whither
the Moors, or Moguls, go in pilgrimage with so great devotion, that some of them put Padlocks
on their mouths to keep them from speaking,A fabulous miracle. and never take them off, but only when
they are to eat. Others fasten Iron chains to their arms; and it is reported, that the Padlocks
are opened, and the Chains loosed, by some supernatural power, as soon as they have
accomplish'd their Vows at the Sepulchre.
               We left Broitschia in the Evening,Leaves broitshia. accompany'd by the Secretary, who would needs
bring us half a League out of the City. He return'd thither, but it was to the end he
might overtake us five Leagues thence; for, being entrusted with the management of the
Commerce of Brodca, as well as of that of Broitschia, he thought fit to go along with the
Caravan. We travell'd all night, and the next day, till the extraordinary heat forc'd us to
encamp near a Fish-pond, where we pass'd away the rest of that day, and some part of the
night following, our recreation being to set a dancing the Women that were among the
Benjans in the Caravan. We went thence after midnight. I intreated the Secretary to
come into my Coach, where I learnt of him several particulars of the Country, which by
reason of my small stay in those parts, it was impossible I could have observed. We pass'd
through the Village of Karawanet and Kabol, where they made us pay a certain passage-Toll.
               Being come within some Leagues of the City of Brodra,Comes to Brodra. the English Secretary went on
before to take order for our lodging and entertainment. We met him with his Second,
about half a League from the City,OCTOBER whither we came the seventh of October. The Kaffila
pass'd through the City, to be lodg'd on the other side of it; and the English Merchants
carried me into a pleasant Country-house without the City, purposely built for a Mausleum,
to a person of Quality of the Country, whose desire it had been to be there buried
with all his Family. Having taken two or three turns in the Garden, we went to the
Lodge belonging to the English, where they made the greatest entertainment imaginable;
and to come to the height of that Countries endearments, they sent for some Benjan women,
who were very desirous to see my cloaths, which I still wore after the German fashion,
(though the English and Dutch, who are settled in the Indies, go ordinarily according to

the mode of the Country) and would have oblig'd me to put them off; but perceiving I
was unwilling to do it, and withall that I made some difficulty to accept of the proffers
they made me to strip themselves naked, and to do any thing I would expect from persons
of their sex and profession, they seem'd to be very much troubled, and so went away.
               The City of BrodraBrodra described. lies in a sandy Plain upon the little River Wasset, 30. Cos, or 15.
Leagues from Broitschia. This City is of no long standing, as having been built by Rasia
Ghie, son of Sulthan Mahomet Begeran, last King of Guzuratta, out of the ruines of the
ancient Brodra, which was heretofore called Radiapora, from which it is distant about half
a League. It is fortifi'd with good Walls and Bastions, according to the ancient manner
of Fortification, and hath five Gates, one whereof is damm'd up, because there is no highway
abuts upon it. The Inhabitants of it, especially those of that part of the Suburbs
which is towards the West-side of the City, are for the most part Benjans and Ketteris by
profession, Weavers, Dyes, and other workers in Cotton, as being the place where, of all
the Province, the best Clothes are made, which are more close, but a small matter narrower
and shorter then those of Broitschia; and it is by that they are distinguished from the
others. There are several sorts thereof, to wit, Bastas, Nquamas, Madasons, Cannequins,
black Chelas, blew Assamanis, Berams, and Tircandias. We thought fit to name these several
species, that we may the better understand the relations which come daily from those
parts.
               The jurisdiction of the Governour of Brodra extends it self over two hundred and ten
Villages, sixty five whereof are design'd for the maintenance of the Garrison, and the Mogul
disposes of the 135. for the advantage and entertainment of certain Officers of the
Court, who have their pensions charg'd upon those Villages. Among which there is one
called Sindickera, eight Leagues from the City, which yields yearly above 25000. pounds
of Lacca.Lacque. This Lacque is a Gum taken out of a certain kind of Tree, which is not much
unlike our Plum-trees; and there is abundance of it gotten all over Guzuratta. Its colour
is of a red brown; but when it is well dry'd, and beaten to powder, the Indians give
it what colour they please, black, red, green, yellow, &c. and make it into sticks to seal Letters
withall, or use it to adorn and beautifie their houshold-stuffe, as Chests, Boxes, Cabinets,
Tables, Bedsteads, &c. whereby they give them such a lustre, as none yet could ever imitate
in Europe, especially upon black. This Country does also produce much Indico.
               Besides the Sepulchre we spoke of before,The Sepulchres of Mahumetan Saints. there are many others to be seen without the
City, most of them very magnificently built, having spacious Gardens about them, which
are open for any that would go in.
               The same day I took leave of the Secretary, and went along with two English Merchants
to the Caravan, which we found encamped at the corner of a Grove of the Palms,
which bear Cocos, and out of which they get Terry, which is the ordinary drink of those
parts. In the evening came the Dutch Secretary or Deputy of Brodra, who presented us
with some bottles of Sack, and kept us company till after midnight.
               One of the English Merchants came along with the Caravan as far as Wasset, which is
an old Castle partly ruin'd, built upon a high Mountain, where there is kept a Garrison, consisting
of a hundred Horse, who there received a certain Impost of a Ropia and a half,
which amounts to somewhat under four shillings, for every Wagon: but we had a Passport
from the Mogul, by vertue whereof we were to pass without paying, upon which account
it was that one of their Merchants came along with the Caravan to that place. Accordingly
the Souldiers of the Garrison staid some of our Wagons, and would have forc'd
us to pay the ordinary duties; but we oppos'd it, and drew up our Convoy, who made their
passage by force. We cross'd the River, and lodg'd in a Village, fortifying our selves with
our Wagons against the attempts which might have been made against us. We found afterwards
that this circumspection was no more then needed. For ere we had quite supped,
came the Receiver with some thirty Souldiers, well arm'd with Half-pikes, Swords, Bucklers
and Guns, and desiring a conference with us, we suffered him to enter with three of
his Souldiers; but he demanding the duties of us, we told him, that we were not to pay
any, and that the Mogul's Pass freed us; yet to avoid further trouble, and out of our good
will to the Souldiers of the Garrison, we should make them a present of five or six Ropias.
They would not hear of any such proposition, and still stood upon the payment of the
whole duty. And so they went away, but with a design to return the next morning, as
indeed they did. At the same time came a Dutch Merchant, who conducted a Caravan of
170. Wagons, guarded by 50. Souldiers, all Indosthans. He told us that the Souldiers of
the Garrison had fell'd down a great Tree, and laid it cross our way, purposely to hinder
our passage. We immediately commanded out four of our Souldiers to go and clear the
way; which oblig'd those of the Castle to send some of theirs to hinder them: but in

regard they could not go by, without coming within reach of our Muskets, we put our
selves into a posture of disputing their passage, and they attempted to force us out of our
retrenchment, which occasion'd the coming back of those whom we had sent to clear the
way. There was some firing on both sides; but we had so much the advantage of them,
that those of the Castle came to a composition, and represented to us by the Dutch Merchants,
that having no other pay then what they receiv'd from the Merchandises passing
that way, they were forc'd to make passengers pay the duties, that they might have wherewithal
to subsist, and that they would be content with one half of what was ordinarily
received, nay, to avoid further inconvenience, with what we had proffer'd them the day
before; so that they had at last six Ropias, which amount to about three Crowns. Their
number, during this contest, encreas'd to a hundred; and the Indian Souldiers, who convey'd
us, refused to take up Arms against them, alledging it was not lawful for them to fight against
the Souldiers of their Soveraign, and that it was their business to defend us against
the Robbers, who might set upon us in the High-way. Two Leagues and a half thence is
the Village of Ammenoygii; and at three and a half further, that of Sejuntra, whence we
came to the little City of Nariad,Comes to Nariad. which some call Niriaud, nine Leagues from Brodra. Its
houses are handsome enough, and there are made in it Cottons and Indico, but not such
abundance thereof as there is in the places before mentioned.
               October 11. we came to Mamadebath.To Mamadebath. This little City is within five Leagues of Nariad,
upon a pretty large River which is very full of Fish. It is a handsome pleasant place,
and was built by two Brothers, who have made a very considerable Castle on the Northside
of the City. The Inhabitants of it are Benjans, and they make there great quantities
of Cotton-thread, wherewith they drive a great Trade.
               October 12. We travell'd five Leagues, and having pass'd by Canis, Batova, and Issempour,
where there is a very fair Caravansera,To Amadebat. or, as they call it in India, a Sary for the lodging of
the Caffilas, or Caravans, we got the same day very safely to Amadabath.
               The two Merchants and my self went before, and we took along with us the Wagon
that carried the provisions. Within half a League of the City, we entred into one of
those Gardens, in which persons of Quality are wont to have their Sepulchres, and staying
there for the coming up of the Caravan, we sent to the principal Merchant, who mannaged
the Commerce in those parts, to acquaint him with our arrival. His name was Benjamin
Roberts, and he had no sooner heard the news, but he took his Coach and came to receive
me.The Indian Oxon as metalsome as the Horses in Germany. His Coach made after the Indian fashion, was gilt all over, covered with several pieces
of rich Persian Tapistry, and drawn by two white Oxen, which express'd as much metal
as we could have expected from the best Horses in Germany. There was also led by the
Coach a very stately Persian Horse, the harness whereof was covered with plates of Silver.
He took a Collation with us of the little Sack and English Beer we had left, after which he
took me into the Coach with him, and brought me to the City, ordering the Merchants to
stay in the Garden till the Caravan were come up.
               The English House or Lodge is in the middle of the City, well built, and hath many
fair and convenient Apartments, with spacious Courts for the disposal of Merchandises,
Master Roberts brought me first into his own Chamber, which look'd into a little Flower-garden,
in which there was a Fountain. The floor was cover'd with Tapistry, and the
pillars which sustain'd the structure were set out with Silk-stuffes of several colours, and
above, a great white tassel according to the custom of the great Ones of the Country. We
had a Collation; after which he shew'd me the whole house, and brought me into a very
fair Chamber, with a large Closet in it, which he had design'd for my Lodging. We supp'd
in a great Hall, whither the Dutch Deputy came after supper to see us, with some of his
Merchants, with whom I had occasion to be acquainted at Suratta. After he was gone,
the whole company conducted me to my Chamber, where my Host kept me company till
after midnight. And that there might not be ought wanting in my entertainment (which
in answer to the recommendatory Letters I had brought from the President, he would
needs have in all things extraordinary) he sent for six Women-dancers, the handsomest
could be found in the City, and told me, that if I liked any thing in them besides their singing
and activity, I needed only to express my desires, and be confident, that they would give
me all the satisfaction and divertisement which those of their sex are able either to give or
take. I thanked him for his civility, but besides that, I had had some touches of my discase
by the way, I made some scruple to meddle in that kind with a Pagan.
               They admir'd my cloaths, but above all that Lock of my hair that hung down over my
shoulders: and could hardly be induced to believe I was what I really am.
               Having slaid two dayes at Amadabath, my noble entertainer took me along with him in
a Coach, followed by two others, and shewed me some part of the City.
               
                  
He first brought me to the great Market-place, called Meydan-Schach, or the Kings
Market,The Meydan. which is at least 1600. foot long, and half as many broad, and beset all about with
rows of Palm-trees, and Date-trees, intermix'd with Citron-trees and Orange-trees,
whereof there are very many in the several Sterets: which is not only very pleasant to
the sight, by the delightful prospect it affords, but also makes the walking among them
more convenient, by reason of the coolness. Besides this Meydan, there are in the City
four Basars, or publick places, where are sold all kinds of Merchandises.
               The same day,The Castle. I saw also the Castle, which is very large, and built of Free-stone, insomuch
that into is one of the most considerable in the Kingdom. Not far from the Meydan,
we went into a House built of Brick, which they call the Kings Palace. Over the Gate,
there was a kind of Curtain or Stage, for the Musick, consisting of Violins, Haw-boys and
Bag-pipes, which play there in the morning, at noon, in the evening, and at midnight, as
they do in Persia, and all other places, where the Prince professes the Mahumetan Religion.
All the Appartments of the House were sumptuous, gilt and adorn'd with painting, according
to the mode of the Country: but more to their satisfaction, who are pleas'd with
diversity of Colours, then theirs, who look for invention, and stand upon the exactness of
proportions.
               Then we went out of the City, to see the Walls of it, which are very fair, having twelve
Gates, and many great Towers, with a Ditch sixteen fathom broad, but in many places it is
ruin'd, and without water.
               We return'd into the City,A. Mosquey of the Benjans. to see the principal Mosquey of the Benjans, which without
dispute is one of the noblest structures that can be seen. It was then new, for the Founder,
who was a rich Benjan Merchant, named Santides, was living in my time. The Mosquey
stands in the middle of a great Court, which is enclos'd with a high Wall of Free-stone,
all about which there is a Gallery, much after the manner of our Cloysters in Monasteries,
having all its Seats or Cells, and in every Cell a Marble Statue, white or black, representing
a Woman naked, sitting, and having her legs lying cross under her, according to the mode
of the Countrey. There were some had three Statues, to wit, a great one between two
little ones.
               At the entrance into the Mosquey, there are two Elephants of black Marble done to the
life, and upon one of them the Effigies of the Founder. The whole Mosquey is vaulted, and
the Walls adorn'd with several Figures of men and other living Creatures. There was
not any thing within the Mosquey, save that at the further end of the Structure there were
three Chappels, or obscure places, divided one from the other by wooden Rails, wherein
might be seen Statues of Marble, like those we had seen in the Cells, with this difference
only, that there was a lighted Lamp before that which stood in the middle. We saw there
also one of their Priests, who was then busie in receiving from the hands of such as came
thither to do their Devotions, Flowers, wherewith he adorn'd his Images, as also Oyl for
the Lamps which hung before the Rails, and Wheat and Salt for the Sacrifice. While he
set the Flowers about the Statues, his mouth and nose were covered with a Linnen-cloath,
left the impurity of his breath should prophane the Mystery, and coming ever and anon
near the Lamp, he mutter'd over certain Prayers, and rub'd his hands up and down in the
flame thereof, as if he had wash'd them in the smoak, and sometimes stroak'd his face with
them. This was a kind of Purification, done out of a perswasion which these people
have, that Fire having a far greater power of purifying then Water, they may after this
Ceremony lift up clean and pure hands to God. But he continued this foolery so long, that
we had not the patience to see the end of it; so that we left him in the midst thereof, to
go and see the Sepulchres, which are the most remarkable Rarities of the City, whereof we
shall here give a short description.
               Amadabath,Amadabath described. the Metropolis of all Guzuratta, lies at 23. degrees, 32. minutes on this side
the line, 18. Leagues from Cambaya, and 45. from Suratta, upon a small River, which not
far thence falls into the Indus. It is a very great and populous City, comprehending with
its Suburbs, and the Villages adjacent thereto, which are part of it, near seven Leagues in
compass. The Streets of it are very broad, and both publick and private buildings very
magnificent, especially the Mosqueys, and the Governours House of the Province. There
is a Guard kept there day and night, and the Garrison is very considerable, by reason of the
Badures, a sort of people distant thence but 25. Leagues, who acknowledge not the Mogul
for their Soveraign, and make perpetual incursions upon his Subjects. There is not in a
manner any Nation, nor any Merchandises in all Asia, which may not be had at Amadabath,
where particularly there are made abundance of Silks and Cotton-stuffs. 'Tis true, they
seldom use any Silk in that Country, much less any out of Persia, because it is somewhat
too course and too dear; but they ordinarily make use of that of China, which is very

fine, mingling it with that of Bengala, which is not quite so fine, but much beyond that of
Persia, and much cheaper. They also make there great quantities of Gold and Silver Brocadoes,
but they put too much thin Lace into them, so that in goodness and substance they
come not near those of Persia, though some of them amount in the Country to eighteen
Crowns the Piece.
               At the time of my being there, they had begun to make a new kind of Stuff of Silk and
Cotton with flowers of Gold, which was very much esteem'd, and sold at five Crowns the
Ell; but the Inhabitants were forbidden the wearing of it, upon this account, that the
King reserv'd it for his own, yet not so strictly, but that he permitted Forraigners to buy of
it, to be transported out of the Kingdom.
               They make there also all sorts of Sattins and Velvets of all sorts of colours;The principal Commodities there. Taffata,
Sattins for linings, of both Thread and Silk, Alcatifs or Carpets, the ground Gold, Silk
or Yarn, but not so good as those of Persia, and all sorts of Cottons. The other Commodities
to be commonly had there, are Sugar, Candy'd or in Powder, Cummin, Honey,
Lacque, Opium, Borax, Ginger, dry and preserv'd Myrobalans or Indian Plums, and all
other sorts of Preserves, Salt-Peter, Sal armoniack, and Indico, which the Inhabitants
call Anil, and which grows there in great abundance. There are also Diamonds to be
sold there, but in regard they are brought from Visiapour, they may be had cheaper elsewhere.
               There is also to be had some Amber-greece, and Musk,Musk and Amber-greece. though the Countrey affords not
any; for the best Amber-greece comes from Pegu, and Bengala, from Mosambique and Capo
verte, and is sold at Amadabath, at 40. Momoudis, or 8. Crowns the ounce. Some are of
opinion, that Amber is the feed of the Whale, hardned or congeal'd by cold in the Sea:
but if this were so, there would be plenty of it found in the North, where men look after
this Fish meerly to get out of it a certain liquor, which is as stinking and infectious as the
smell of the Amber is sweet and pleasant. Nor can I approve of their opinion, who believe
there are within the earth certain veins or sources of Amber, as there are of Nefte, or
certain Mines, as those of Brimstone, since there is none to be found but towards the Sea,
wherein it grows as Mushrooms do upon the earth, and is fastned to the bottom, till such
time as the Sea,A piece of Amber-greece that weighed eighty pound. being tossed up and down by the Winds, casts it towards the shore. Peter
de la Brouck, a Hollander, who made a Voyage to Angola, Guinny, and the Indies, in the
years 1605. and 1606. sayes in his Relation, that in his time, there was found at Cabo verde,
at the mouth of the River Gambi, a piece of Amber-greece, which weigh'd eighty pounds,
whereof he bought some part.
               As for Musk,Musk. all are joyntly of opinion, that it comes of an Imposthume or Swelling,
which rises about the Navil of a certain Animal, which some affirm to be about the bigness
of a Fox, and others say, is like a Roe-buck. Whether then it be that this rising of the
flesh about that part happens every year, when those Creatures go to rut, and that as they
tumble up and down the Grass it breaks, or that it is cut off when they are taken, certain
it is that it comes from a living Creature, which some Authors call Gazela; but the Inhabitants
of Pegu give it another name, which I could not learn, and which is not to be found
in the Relations, or Natural Histories of the East -Indies.
               Michael Boyen, a Jesuite, who some years since printed, at Vienna, a Treatise, which he
calls La Flore Chinoise, sayes, that the right Musk is made of the Kidneys and Testicles of
that Animal, which he calls Hiam, but that the China Merchants, who adulterate most of
their Merchandises, put among it some of the flesh and bloud of the said Animal, and so
make up a kind of composition, wherewith they fill the little Purses made of the Skin of
the same Beast, which the Portuguez call Popos, and endeavour to make them pass for the
right Cods. However this may hold, certain it is, that this excellent scent proceeds from a
Beast, and that it may be called the soul of all Perfume. But there is not any thing so considerable
as the convenience which this place affords for matter of exchange, the Benjans
having their Correspondents in all parts of Asia, even at Constantinople; and this is so much
the more to the advantage of the Merchant, the more he stands in fear of the Rasboutes,
and other Robbers, who make travelling very dangerous, notwithstanding all the expence
the Mogul is at, to maintain a great number of Souldiers, who are particularly kept for the
safety of the High-wayes.
               There is nothing paid here,Merchandises pay no duties or custom at Amadabat. either at the exportation or importation of Merchandises,
save that the Couteval, or Kings Lieutenant, hath given him by way of Present, about 15.
pence for every Wago; and it is lawful for all Forreigners to buy, and sell, and trade in all
sorts of Merchandises, those only excepted which are prohibited, as Gun-powder, Lead
and Salt-Peter, which may not be transported without the Governours permission; but
that it is no hard matter to obtain, making but a slender acknowledgment of his favour
therein.
               
                  
The City of Amadabat comprehends within its territory twenty five great Towns, and
two thousand nine hundred ninety and eight Villages,Its jurisdiction and revenue. so as that the revenue thereof amounts
to above six millions of Crowns, whereof the Governour hath the disposal, and therewith
maintains the Souldiers, whom he is oblig'd to keep for the Kings service, especially against
Robbers upon the high-wayes; though many times he protects them, and divides the
booty with them. The Couteval, who is as it were the King Lieutenant, commands under
the Sulthan, and mannages the political Government, nay meddles also with the administration
of Justice joyntly with the Kasi or ordinary Judge. The Mogul hath there also
several other Officers, who are as it were Controllers and Supervisors of those we last
named.
               The dayes following I spent in seeing the Sepulchres which are about the City, and among
others,The Sepulchre of a Kasi. particularly that which is in the Village of Zirkees, about a League and a
half from Amadabat. 'Tis the work of a King of Guzuratta, built by him to the memory
of a Kasi, who had been his Praeceptor, and is grown very famous upon the account of
many pretended Miracles done by him after his death. The whole Structure, wherein
there are four hundred and forty great pillars, thirty foot high, is of Marble, as also the
floor of it, and serves for a Sepulchre to three other Kings, who would needs be buried
there with their Families. At the entrance of this sumptuous Monument, there is a large
Tanke, or Cistern, full of water, and enclos'd with a wall, which hath several windows all
about it. The Mahumetans of those parts go on Pilgrimage thither; and in this Village
of Zirkees is made the best Indico in all the Country. About a League thence, there is
a spacious Garden, with a fair House within it, which the Mogul, Chon Chimauw, built, in
memory of a Victory gained by him in that place over Sulthan Mahomed Begeran, last
King of Guzuratta, upon which he united that Kingdom to his Crown, as we shall express
hereafter.
               About a League and a half from the City, we were shewn a Sepulchre, which they call
Betti-Chuit,The Sepulchre of an incestuous Father. that is to say, thy daughters shame discovered. There lies interr'd in it a rich
Merchant, a Moor, named Hajam Majom, who falling in love with his own Daughter, and
desirous to shew some pretence for his incest, went to an Ecclesiastical Judge, and told him
in general terms, That he had in his youth, taken the pleasure to plant a Garden, and to
dress and order it with great care, so that now it brought forth such excellent fruits, that
his neighbours were extreamly desirous thereof, that he was every day importuned to communicate
unto them, but that he could not yet be perswaded to part therewith, and that
it was his design to make use of them himself, if the Judge would grant him in writing a
Licence to do it. The Kasi, who was not able to dive into the wicked intentions of this
unfortunate man, made answer, That there was no difficulty in all this, and so immediately
declar'd as much in writing. Hajom shewed it his Daughter, and finding nevertheless, that
neither his own authority, nor the general permission of the Judge, would make her consent
to his brutal enjoyments, he ravished her. She complain'd to her Mother, who made
so much noise about it, that the King Mahomet Begeran coming to hear thereof, ordered
him to lose his head.
               Not far from Amadabat begin to appear the dreadful Mountains of Marva,The mountains of Marva. which reach
above 70. Leagues towards Agra, and above a hundred towards Ouyen, and are so inaccessible,
that the Castle of Gurchitto, (where lives Rana one of the principal Radias of those parts)
is accounted impregnable,Where live Princes not subject to the Mogul. in so much that the Kings of Pettan, and the Mogul himself, found
much ado to reduce it. The Indians, who are Pagans, have still a great Veneration for that
Prince, who, they say, was so powerful, as that he could in a short time bring 120000.
Horse into the Field.
               In the Mountain which lies between Amadabat and Trappe, there lives another Radia,
who is not subject to the Mogul, by reason the Woods and Deserts secure him against that
Prince, who with all his power is not able to force him out of the places he is possess'd of,
no more then he is the Radia of Ider, who is his Vassal, but many times refuses to obey his
Orders.
               One of the noblest Gardens about the City is that of Schach-bag,Schach-bag Corden. in that part of the
Suburbs which is called Begampour. It is the King Garden, very spacious, encompass'd
with a high Wall, and hath within it a very fair House, the Ditches whereof are full of
water, and the appartments richly furnish'd. I went thence along a Stone-bridge, which
is four hundred paces in length, to another Garden, called Niccinabag, that is to say, the
Jewel, and they say it was planted by a beautiful and rich young Lady. The Garden is
not very great no more then the House within it; but both very advantageously seated in
a place high enough to discover all the adjacent Champion, and upon the avenues of the

Bridge, to make the noblest prospect that ever I saw. The Rain which falls in the Winter
time supplyes a great Fish-poud or Pool in the middle of the Garden, but in Summer
they make use of certain Engines, wherewith many Oxen put together draw up the
water out of Wells, which are so deep, that they are never dry. A man can seldom go to
this Garden, but he shall find some young Women bathing themselves, they will not persuit
the Indians should see them, but suffered us to come in and speak to them.
               There are so many other Gardens about Amadabat, and the whole City is so full of
Trees, that a man may say, it makes all but one Garden; for as he comes to the City, he sees
such abundance of them, that he may well think he is going into a Forrest. Among other
things I took particular notice of the High-way, which they call Bascaban, and leads to a Village
six Leagues distant from the City. It is so straight, that it should seem they took a great
pleasure in planting the Trees about it, whereof there is a double row on both sides upon a
straight line. They are Cocos-Trees, which at all times refresh Travellers with their shade:
but this road comes nothing near that which goes from Agra to Barampour,An Ally 150 Leagues together. which makes
but one continued Ally for a hundred and fifty Germans Leagues together. All these
Teees lodge and feed an incredible number of Apes, among which there are some as big as
Greyhounds, and strong enough to set upon a Man; but they never do it unless they be
angred. They are most of them of a greenish brown colour, and their beards and eyebrows
long and white. They multiply extreamly, by reason the Benjans, who are much
more numerous in those parts then the Mahumetans, believe the Metempsychosis, or transmigration
of souls, and permit not the killing of beasts, and these much less then any other,
because they have some resemblance of Man, and are perswaded, that the merriest and best
humour'd souls, after their departure out of the body, retire into these Creatures; whence
it comes that the City is full of them. They come into people houses at any time with all
the freedom imaginable, and in so great numbers, that those who sell Fruits and Preserves
have much ado to keep them from their houses, and to secure their Ware. I remember
one day I counted above fifty at the English house at the same time, which fell a playing
and putting themselves into several postures, as if they had been sent thither purposely to
make me sport. I one day chanc'd do cast some Dates and Almonds among two or three
Apes that came in, which they liked so well, that they waited every morning at my Chamber
door for their Breakfast, and became at last so familiar, that they would take Fruit, or
Bread, or any thing else out of my hand. I would sometimes catch one of them by the
Foot, so to oblige the others to snarle at me, and as it were to demand their Companion,
which I did till such time as I saw them make ready to set upon me, so to force him out of
my hands.
               The same Trees maintain all sorts of wild Fowl,Parrots. but especially an infinite number of
Parrots, whereof there are several kinds. The biggest are called Indian Crows. Some
are all white, or of a Pearl colour, having on their Crowns a tuft of Feathers of a Carnation
red, and they are called Kahatou, from that word which in their chattering they pronounce
very distinctly. These Birds are common all over the Indies, where they make
their Nests in Cities, under the Eaves of Houses, as Swallows do in Europe. The lesser
sort of them, which are the more valued for the beauty and diversity of their colours, their
Feathers being checquer'd between a lively Carnation and a bright Green, build their Nests
in the Woods, and fasten them to the tops of the branches, so as that they hang in the
Air, by which means they preserve their young ones from the Serpents that would devour
them. They build their Nests with Hay or Stubble, and many times they fasten two together,
with a covering above, and another beneath. These Birds are a great annoyance
to the Fruits, and do much mischief in the Rice, because none kill them; nay, the Benjans
are so supertitious as not to hinder them from eating; which freedom they also give the
wild Ducks, Herons and Cormorants,Cormorants. whereof there are abundance abut the River. In
the precedent Travels of the Embassadours into Muscovy and Persia, there is some mention
of these Birds, upon occasion of those which we saw upon the River Wolga; We shall only
add here, that it is the same kind of Fowl, that the Natural Histories call Onocratalus, from
the noise it makes in the Water, when it puts its Beak into it, imitating in some sort the
braying of an Ass. It hath the subtilty to swallow down Muscles, and keep them in the
Stomach till the heat thereof hath opened the shell, and then cast them up again to take
out the Fish.
               There is no kind of wild Fowl, nor Venison,Fowl and Venison. which may not be had in these Forrests, but
especially, Fallow-Deer, Roebucks, Ahus, or wild Asses, wild Boars and Hares.
               They have also store of tame Creatures,Tame creatures. as Buffles, Oxen, Cows and Sheep: And the
Rivers is so well furnished with all sorts of Fish,Fish. that it may be confidently affirmed, there
is no place in the world where a man might live more deliciously.
               
                  
They want nothing but Wine; but to supply their want of that, they have Terri, taken
out of the Cocos-trees,No Wine iu Guzratta. which drinks as deliciously as Wine. They have the most
excellent Water in the World; and out of Rice, Sugar and Dates, they extract their
Arak,Arak. which is a kind of Aqua vitae, much stronger and more pleasant then that which
is made in Europe.
               But as the Kingdom of Guzuratta is furnish'd with Creatures beneficial to man,Hurtful creatures. as to
carriage or otherwise, so are there also some which he must have a care of. There is no
River but is pester'd with abundance of Crocodiles,Crocodiles. called by the Inhabitants Cayman,
which do much mischief, as well in the Water, as upon the Land among the Cattle, nay,
sometimes among Men, whom they surprise when they go a swimming, or when they go
in Boats near the shore; this Creature being so nimble, that a Man hath much ado to escape
by running, though it were no hard matter for him, by frequent turnings and windings
to avoid his pursuit: for the Crocodile having no Vertebrae or joynts either in his
neck or back, he cannot turn himself, and thence it comes that most commonly he rather
surprises Men then pursues them. He commonly lurks in the high Grass on the River
side, to catch at those who come for Water; and the Benjans, who believe that the Souls
of those who are thus devour'd by these Creatures, are immediately admitted into Paradise,
take no course to destroy them. It is very certain, that in the Ditches of the City of
Pegu there were Crocodiles above thirty foot in length,Crocodiles 30. foot long. and fed so much upon Mans flesh,
that no day pass'd but they devour'd some or other, and yet the Benjans took no course in
the world to prevent it and destroy them.A Crocodile swallows a woman with all her cloaths. But the King having caused one to be more
particularly observed, which did more mischief aloe then all the rest, had it taken and
kill'd. There was one had swallow'd down a Woman with all her cloaths about her.
They cover their Eggs, having laid to the number of 28 or 30. with Sand, about the
change of the Moon, and so leave them till the wane, by which time they are hatch'd;
when they uncover them,How they lay their Eggs. they kill a great many of the young ones, which hinders them
from multiplying, as they would do otherwise to infinity. Iohnston in his Natural History
saith, that near Panama,Crocodiles 100. foot long. in the West-Indies, there were found Crocodiles above a hundred
foot long. But we shall not here make a digression into Natural History, and ingenuosly
acknowledge, that those we saw were about twelve or fifteen foot long. The skin, or rather
scales of their backs is harder then Armour musket-proof; so that to destroy them,
a man must go on one side of them, and run them into the belly. The Inhabitants of the
Country affirm, that this Creature is of its own nature cowardly, and that it avoids those
who stand to it, and hath courage only when it hath to do with those that have not any,
and run away from it.
               Another quality which this Country hath, not common with all places, is, that it produces
abundance of Snakes and Serpents,Serpents. which are here very dangerous, and among the
rest those, which from a Greek word are called Amphisbenes, and have two heads. I must
confess I never saw any of them, and expect not that upon my testimony any should condemn
the opinion of those, who with much probability affirm, that Nature produces no
Creature with two heads, unless she intend to make sport, and frame a Monster; and that
their errour, who speak of the Amphisbene, proceeds only hence, that they have seen Serpents,
which, contrary to the ordinary form of all Reptiles, are as big towards the tail as towards
the head. We might also very well esteem those somewhat ridiculously conceited,
who would have people believe, that these heads command' and obey alternately by years,
if those of the Country did not affirm as much, and if Nirembergius, in his Natural History,
write, that an Inhabitant of Madrid, named Cortavilla, had assur'd him that he had seen
it: but he doth not himself believe what he adds to that Story; to wit, that this Creature
hath under one of its Tongues the Remedy against the Poyson which the other
had cast.
               The Woods are full of Lyons, Leopards, Tigers and Elephants; whereof we shall have
occasion to speak elsewhere.
               But there is no Creature more common in these parts,Batts as big as Crows. as also all over the Indies, then the
Batts, which are as big as Crows with us, nay, there are some about the bigness of our Hens.
They are so great an annoyance to Gardens, that people are oblig'd to watch them, for the
preservation of the Fruits.
               The City of Amadabat maintains for the Mogul's service,Amadabat maintains 12000. horse. out of its own Revenue, twelve
thousand Horse, and fifty Elephants, under the command of a Chan, or Governour, who hath
the quality of Radia, Raja, or Rasgi, that is to say, Prince. He who commanded there in
my time,The Governours wealth. was called Areb-chan, and about sixty years of age. I was credibly inform'd,
that he was worth in Money and Houshold-stuffe, ten Crou, or Carroas Ropias, which amount
to fifty millions of Crowns, the Crou being accounted at a hundred Lake Ropias,

each whereof is worth fifty thousand Crowns. It was not long before, that his Daughter,
one of the greatst Beauties in the Country, had been married to the Mgul's second
Son, and the Chan, when she went to the Court, had sent her attended by twenty Elephants,
a thousand Horse, and six thousand Waggons, loaden with the richest Stuffs, and
whatever else was rare in the Country.His Court. His Court consisted of above 500. persons, 400.
whereof were his slaves, who serv'd him in his affairs, and were all dieted in the house. 
have it from good hands,His Expence. that his expence in house-keeping amounted to above five thousand
Crowns a moneth, not comprehending in that account that of his Stables, where he
kept five hundred Horse and fifty Elephants. The most eminent Persons of his retinue
were very magnificently clad, though as to his own person, he was nothing curious, and
was content commonly with a Garment of Cotton, as are the other Indosthans, unless it
were when he went abroad into the City, or took a journey into the Country; for then
he went in great state, sitting ordinarily in a rich Chair, set upon an Elephant, cover'd with
the richest Tapistry, or Alcatifs of Persia, being attended by the Guard of 200. men, having
many excellent Persian Horses led, and causing several Standards and Banners to be
carried before him.
               October 18. I went along with the English Merchant to visit the Governour,Mandelslo visits the Governour of Amadabat. whom we
found sitting in a Pavilion or Tent which look'd into his Garden. Having caused us to sit
down by him, he asked the Merchant who I was: He told him in the Indosthan Language,
that I was a Gentleman of Germany, whom a desire to see forreign Countries, and to improve
himself by Travel, had oblig'd to leave his own. That coming into Persia, upon
occasion of an Embassie sent thither by the Prince my Master, I took a resolution to see the
Indies,Their discourse. as being the noblest Country in the world; and being come to that City, that I
hoped he would not take it ill if I aspir'd to the honour of waiting upon him. The Governour
made answer, I was very welcome, that my resolution was noble and generous, and
that he pray'd God to bless and prosper it. He thereupon asked me, whether during my
aboad in Persia, I had learnt ought of the Language. I reply'd, that I had a greater inclination
to the Turkish Language, and that I understood it so far as to make a shift to express
my self in it. The Governour, who was a Persian born, made answer, that it was
true indeed, the Turkish Language was much more commonly spoken in the Scach's Court
then that of the Country, and thereupon asked me my age, and how long it was since I left
Germany. I told him I was 24. years of age, and that I had travelled three years. He
reply'd, that he wondred very much my friends would suffer me to travel so young, and
and asked me whether I had not chang'd my habit by the way; whereto having made answer
that I had not, he told me, that it was an extraordinary good fortune, that I had travell'd
in that equipage through so many Countries, without meeting with some unhappy
accident, and that the Dutch and English, to prevent any such misfortune, clad themselves
according to the fashion of the Country.
               After about an hours discourse, we would have risen and taken our leaves of him, but the
Governour intreated us to stay and dine with him. He caused some Fruit to be brought,
while his people were laying the cloath, which was of Cotton, laid upon a large Carpet of
red Turkie-leather. The dinner was very noble, and serv'd up and dret according to the
Persian way, the Meat being laid in dishes, all Porcelane, upon Rice of several colours, in the
same manner as we had seen at the Court at Ispahan. Presently after dinner we came away,
but as I was taking my leave of the Governour, he told me in the Turkish Language,
Senni dahe kurim, that is to say, we shall see you again, giving me thereby to understand, that
he would be glad of some further discourse with me.
               Accordingly we went thither again the 20.A second visit to the Governour. but I had clad my self according to the
mode of the Country, upon the design I had to travel into Cambaya, which I could hardly
do without changing habit. We found him in the same appartment where we had seen
him the time before. He was clad in a White Vestment, according to the Indian mode,
over which he had another that was longer, of Brocadoe, the ground Carnation lined with
white Satin, and above, a Collar of Sables, whereof the Skins were sewed together, so as
that the Tails hung down over the back. As soon as he saw us come in, he made us sit
down by the Lords that were with him. He was about some business, which hindred him
for a while from discoursing with us, yet could I not but observe that he was pleased at my
change of habit. He dispatch'd several Orders, and sometimes writ himself; yet did not
his business take him up, so as to hinder him from taking Tobacco, which he took after the
same manner as is elsewhere described in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours, there
standing near him a Servant, who with one hand held to the Pipe to his mouth, and set fire
to it with the other. He quitted that exercise to go and take a view of certain Troops of
Horse and Companies of Foot, which were drawn up in the Court. He would see their

Armes himself, and caus'd them to shoot at a Mark, thereby to judge of their abilities, and
to augment the pay of such as did well at the cost of the others, out of whose pay there
was so much abated. So that seeing him thus employ'd, we would have taken our leaves,
but he sent us word that we should dine with him, causing in the mean time some Fruit to
be sent us, whereof by his order we sent the best part to our Lodging.
               Soon after he call'd for a little golden Cabinet, enrich'd with precious Stones, and having
taken out two Drawers, out of one he took Offion, or Opium, and out of the other Bengi,
a certain Drug, or Powder, made of the leaves and seed of Hemp, which they use to excite
luxury. Having taken a small spoonful of each, he sent the Cabinet to me, and told me,
that it could not otherwise be, but that, during my aboad at Ispahan, I must needs have
learnt the use of the Drug, and that I should find that as good as any I had seen in Persia.
I told him, that I was no competent Iudge of it, in regard I had not used it often; however
I would then take of it for the Honours sake of receiving it from his hands. I took
of it, and the English Merchant did the like, though neither of us had ever taken any before,
nor did much like it then.
               The Governour ask'd me, where I had learnt the Turkish Language, and whether I had
ever been at Constantinople. I told him, I never had been there, but had employ'd the little
time of my aboad in the Provinces of Schirwan, and at Ispahan, in learning that Language,The Governour of Amadabat  Persian born.
which is as common there as that of the Country. He told me that Schiwan was
his Country, and understanding that I had been particularly known to Schach Sefi, had
dined at his Table, and been a hunting with him, he ask'd my judgment of the King of
Persia, and what I thought worthy commendation or censure in that Prince? I made answer,
that he was a Prince of a graceful Aspect and Person, and one that had understanding
and courage enough to be obey'd in his Kingdom.But loves not the King of Persia. He ask'd me, whether he still reign'd
as a Tyrant, and continu'd his former cruelties? I answered, that Age having moderated
his youthful extravagancies, his government began to be also more moderate.
               But the Chan reply'd, that Schach Sefi had assum'd the Scepter with bloudy hands, and
that the beginning of his reign had cost the lives of an infinite number of persons, of all
conditions and qualities: That Cruelty was hereditary to his Family: That it descended
to him from Scach-Abas, his Grand-father, and that there was little hope he could rid himself
of a quality that was become in a manner natural to him, though he might happily
dissemble it for a time: That that was the only reason for which Alymerdan-Chan, Governour
of Candahar, had been forc'd to cast himself into the protection of the Mogul, and to
deliver up his place to him; as knowing his life was in danger, though he had never done
ought against the service of his Prince, and that he was sent for to Court, to augment the
number of those Lords whom that Tyrant had put to death: That he was content to believe,
that Shach Sefi was an understanding person, but that even as to that, there was no
more comparison between him and the Mogul, then there was between the poverty of the
one and the vast wealth of the other, the Prince his Master being able to maintain a War
against three Kings of Persia. I was loth to enter into any contestation upon so ticklish
a subject,Mandeslo's discrtion. and therefore only told him, that it was indeed true, there was not any comparison
between the Gold, and the Silver, and Wealth of Persia, and what I had already seen of
the Mogul's Kingdom; but that it must be withall confess'd, that Persia had one thing
which could not be had elsewhere, and was in effect inestimable, which was the great number
of Kisilbachs, with whose assistance the King of Persia might attempt the conquest of
all Asia. Which I said purposely, knowing the Governour was a Kisilbach, and that he
could take no offence at such a discourse. Accordingly he discover'd his satisfaction thereat,
not only in saying, that he must grant it to be true, but also, when turning to one of the
Lords, who was a Persian as well as himself, he said to him, Walla beksade, jasehi a-damdur,
chassa adamlar souer, that is to say, I believe this young Gentleman hath courage, when he
speaks so well of those that have.
               By that time we had ended this discourse dinner was brought in. The Carver sate in
the middle of the great Vessels wherein the meat was brought up, and with a great spoon
put of it into little dishes, to be serv'd up to us. The Cban himself would needs also put
in some, to assure us of his being pleas'd with our company. The room was full of Military
Officers, whereof some stood with Half-pikes in their hands, others sate about a Tanke
or Cistern which was in the room.
               Immediately after dinner we took leave, but the Governour told us, that he intended to
give us the divertisement of the Women-dancers of the Country, and that we should pass
away the afternoon with him: but some business intervening he could not do it then, and
therefore was forc'd to put it off to some other time. But the earnestess I was in to proscute
my travels into Cambay, together with the little satisfaction I found in the lewd

and insolent Postures of those Women, whereof I had seen but too much in Persia, hindred
me from making any acceptance of his proffers.
               The Governour of Amadabat was a judicious understanding man,A Character of the Governour of Amadabat. but hasty, and so
rigorous, that his Government inclin'd somewhat to cruelty. It happened one day, that
the two principal Directors of the English and Dutch trade there, being invited by him to
dinner; a young Gentleman that waited upon the former, comes into the Hall to attend
upon his Master; He had on a slash'd doublet, much after the fashion which was worn about
30. years since, which the Governour thought so ridiculous, that he could not forbear
laughing at it, and askt the English President, in what quality that slash'd Gallant serv'd
him, since that according to his habit, he conceiv'd he kept him for his Fool. The President
made answer, not without some confusion, that he waited on him in his Chamber, and
that he had opened his Doublet in that manner to make way for the Air, the better to avoid
the excessive heats of the Country, which the Europaeans could not well endure. Whereto
the Governour reply'd, that that reason gave some satisfaction, but what he most wondred
at was, that the Christians, who are a wise and understanding people, had not yet found out
the way to make their Doublets of several shreds, rather then cut and mangle whole pieces
of Stuffes to put themselves into that mode. This jesting with the English Merchant put
him into so good an humour, that he would needs devote the remainder of the day to sport
and divertisement, and thereupon sent for twenty Women-dancers, who as soon as they
were come into the room fell a singing and dancing, but with an Activity and exact observation
of the cadence, much beyond that of our Dancers upon the Ropes. They had little
Hoops or Circles, through which they leap'd as nimbly as if they had been so many Apes,
and made thousands of Postures, according to the several soundings of their Musick, which
consisted of a Tumbeck, or Timbrel, a Haw-boy, and several Tabours. Having danc'd
near two hours, the Governour would needs send into the City for another band of Dancers,
but the Servants brought word, that they were sick and could not come. This excuse
being not taken, he sent out the same Servants, with express order to bring those Prostitutes
away by force; but they returning the second time with the same excuse, he order'd
they should be cudgell'd. Upon that, they cast themselves at the Governours feet,
and acknowledged that it was indeed true, they were not sick, but were at a certain place,
where they got Money at a more delightful and easier sport then dancing, and that they
absolutely deny'd to come, saying, they knew well enough the Governour would not pay
them. He laught at it, but immediately commanded out a party of his Guard to bring
them to him, and they were no sooner entred into the Hall ere he ordered their heads to b
struck off.His cruelty. Mandelslo leaves Amadabat. They beg'd their lives with horrid cries and lamentations; but he would be
obey'd, and caus'd the execution to be done in the room before all the Company, not one
of the Lords then present daring to make the least intercession for those Wretches, who
were eight in number. The Strangers were startled at the horrour of the Spectacle and
inhumanity of the Action; which the Governour taking notice of, fell a laughing, and
ask'd them what they were so much startled at? Assure your selves Gentlemen, said he,
that if I should not take this course, I should not be long Governour of Amadabat. For
should I connive once at their disobedience, these Bete-Seioth, or Sons of Whores, would
play the Masters, and drive me out of the City. 'Tis but prudence in me to prevent their
contempt of my Authority, by such examples of severity as these are.
               October 21. I left Amadabat, with a Coach and one Saddle-nag, in the company of a
young English Merchant, who, by order from the President, was to be my Fellow-traveller.
The Rasboutes make the way between Amadabath and Cambaya very dangerous,
which made me take for my Convoy eight Foot-souldiers arm'd with Pikes and Bucklers.
This kind of Souldiers do also the office of Lacqueys, running just before the Horses, and
may be hired for a small matter; for I gave them but eight Crowns for the whole journey,
though I had them three dayes, in which time I travell'd thirteen of the Country
Leagues.
               All the English Merchants brought me half a League out of the City, where I saw a
sumptuous Tomb,Tschictbag Garden. which they call Salu. I got that day to the Garden of Tschictbag,
made in memory of the place where the Sulthan Mahomet Begoran, whom we spoke of before,
was defeated, and is without all comparison the fairest of any in the Indies; but it being
dark ere I got thither, I shall forbear the description of it till my return that way, at
which time I had the convenience of taking a particular view thereof.
               The 22. Having travell'd seven Leagues, I came to the Village of Serguntra, where,
saw not any thing remarkable, but a great Tanke, or Cistern, wherein rain-water is kept all
the year.
               The 23. After five Leagues travelling, I came to Cambaya. I din'd in sight of the

City among certain Trees, and in the mean time sent one of my Foot-souldiers to a Brocker,
that is to say, one of those Benjans, whom the English and Dutch make use of as Interpreters,
and who understand their Language, together with the Portuguez, which they
learnt by means of the great Commerce that Nation hath had all over the Indies. He
immediately came in a Coach, and having brought me into the City, lodg'd me at a Mahumetan
Merchants, where I was very well accommodated; which course I took, because
the English Factor being from home, I made some difficulty to lodge at the English House.
As soon as I was got into the City, I desir'd the Brocker to shew me what was most worth
the seeing there.
               The City of Cambaya lies 16. Leagues from Broitscia,Cambaya described. in a sandy place upon the River
side, which makes there a great Bay, into which the River May, having past by the Walls
thereof, disembogues it self. The Haven is incommodious, though at High-water there
be above seven fathom water; but at Low-water, the Ships lye dry in the Sand and Mud
that is at the bottom. The City is encompass'd by a very fair Wall of Free-stone, and
hath twelve Gates, very large houses, and strait and broad streets, most whereof have Gates
which are shut up in the night time. It is much greater then Surat, as being at least ten
Leagues about. It hath three Basars or Market-places, and four noble Tanks or Cisterns,
able to find the Inhabitants water all the year long.
               The Inhabitants are for the most part Pagans, Benjans, or Rasboutes, whereof some apply
themselves to Commerce, others to a military life. Their greatest traffick is at Achim, Diu,
Goa, Meca, and into Persia, whither they carry all sorts of Stuffes of Silk and Cotton, and
bring back ready Money, both Gold and Silver, to wit, Ducats, Chequins and Ryals; also
Ruynas, Dates, and other Commodities of those parts. After a walk of two hours, my
Conductor carried me out of the City, and shewed me 15. or 16. publick Gardens, but
among the rest, one, into which I went on that side that was towards the Sea, by a pair of
stairs of Free-stone of many steps. It was enclos'd with a high Wall, and had in it two or
three fair Structures, one whereof being over the Gate, had many noble Appartments. In
the midst of the Garden there is a very high place, within which was the Sepulchre of the
Mahumetan who had founded it, and was there buried with all his Family. The Tomb
was covered with Marble, and had several Arabian Inscriptions: There is not any place
in all those parts that hath so noble a prospect as this, not only towards the Sea-side, but
also towards the Land, where a man hath the sight of the noblest Champion Country in
the World. This is so pleasant a place, that the Mogul being one day at Cambaya, would
needs take up his Lodging in the Garden, and caused the Stones of the Sepulchre to be taken
away, that his Tent might be pitch'd there.
               While I was taking a particular view of that Structure, came up to us two English Merchants,
who obligingly reproach'd me with the slurre I put upon their Nation, in preferring
the House of a Mahumetan before their Lodge, as if I had been but poorly entertain'd at
Suratta, and other places, where I had lodg'd among them. They proffered me their company
to walk, and promised to carry me the next morning to a place, where an Indian Widow
was to be burnt, with her own consent.
               I went at night to my Lodging, whither the Brocker brought several Alcatifs, or pieces of
Tapistry, quilted Coverlets, Silk-stuffes, Cottons, Vessels, Handles for Knives, Seals, Bracelets,
Rings and Buttons of Agat, Cornelian and Jasper, &c. of all sorts of colours, which
pleased me very well; but not being in a condition to spare any money, I only bought
some few trifles, to keep in favour with my Merchant.
               The next day, the English Merchants came to my Lodging, whence we went together to
the River side,An Indian Widow  burnt by her own consent. without the City, where this voluntary execution was to be done. The
Womans Husband was a Rasboute, and had been kill'd near Labor, 200. Leagues from
Cambaya. As soon as she had heard of his death, she would needs do his Obsequies, by
causing her self to be burnt alive; but whereas the Mogul and his Officers are Mahumetans,
who endeavour by degrees to abolish this heathenish and barbarous Custom, the Governour
had a long time oppos'd her desires, under pretence that the news of her Husbands
death being uncertain, he could not consent to the doing of an inhumane action, whereof
there would afterwards haply be cause to repent. The Governours design was to see, whether
time would abate any thing of her passion, and the earnestness she was in to follow her
Husband into the other World: but seeing she was daily more and more instant to do it,
he permitted her to comply with the Laws of her own Religion.
               She was not above twenty years of age, yet we saw her come up to the place of her execution
with so much confidence, and a chearfulness so extraordinary to those who go to
present and inevitable death, that I was much inclin'd to believe, that she had dull'd her
senses with a dose of Opium, which is as commonly used in the Indies as in Psia.
               
                  
In the front of the Procession marched the Country Musick, consisting of Haw-boys and
and Timbrels. Then follow'd a great many Maids and Women, singing and dancing before
the Widow, who was drest in her richest Cloathing, and had her Fingers, her Armes
and Legs loaden with Rings, Bracelets and Carkanets. After her came a confused company
of Men, Women and Children, and so concluded the Procession. She made a stop at the
Funeral Pile, which had been purposely erected for the Ceremony. The Woman had wash'd
her self in the River, that she might meet her Husband in a state of Purity, in regard the
body of the deceased being not upon the place, she could not accompany it in its passage
into the other World. The Pile was of the wood of Apricock-trees, among which they
had put in some Sanders and Cinnamon. Having look'd upon it with a certain contempt,
she took leave of her Kindred and Friends, and distributed among them the Rings and
Bracelets she had about her. I was something near her on horseback, with the two English
Merchants, and I think she perceiv'd in my countenance that I pitied her, whence it
came that she cast me one of her Bracelets, which I had the good hap to catch, and still
keep, in remembrance of so extraordinary an Action.
               As soon as she was got upon the Pile, they set fire to it, which she perceiving, pour'd on
her head a Vessel of persum'd Oly, which the fire immediately taking hold of, she was smother'd
in an instant, so as that she was not perceiv'd to make the least wry face at it. Some
that were present cast upon her several Cruses of Oyl, which soon reduc'd the body to
ashes, while the rest of the Assembly fill'd the Air with their cries and shouts, such as must
needs have hindred those of the Widow to be heard, if she had the time to make any in
the fire, which had made a sudden dispatch of her as if it had been Lighting. The Ashes
were cast into the River.
               I was told,How the custom come up. that this barbarous Custom had been introduc'd among the Pagans of those
parts upon this account, that Polygamy occasioning much heart-burning among the Women,
arising either from the little satisfaction they could have from a man, who is oblig'd
to divide his affections, or the jealousie, which is unavoidable among Rivals of that Sex;
it happened that the Women procur'd their Husbands death; and 'twas found, that in
one year there had been four Men buried for one Woman; so that to oblige them to be
careful of their Husbands lives, it was ordered, that such as were desirous to be accounted
honest Women, should be ingag'd to accompany their Husbands at their death, and to be
burnt together with their bodies. Certain it is, that the Persians, and other neighbouring
Nations, have ever had so particular a veneration for the fire, that it is not to be admir'd
they should chuse rather to reduce their deceased to ashes, then bury them. I say, this Obligation
of dying with their Husbands was imposed only on those Women who stood upon
the reputation of honesty, yet so as they were engag'd thereto only by a principle of honour,
there being not any punishment to be inflicted on such as refused to follow them in that
dreadful journey, other then that they were not admitted into the company of Persons of
quality, as being looked on as infamous Women. They who are not so scrupulous, and stand
not so much upon the punctilio of Honour, and prefer their lives before their reputation, do
ordinarily strike in among the publick Dancers.
               The Ceremony being over, I went to see one of the chiefest Merchants of the City, named
Myrsabeg, to whom I had Letters of recommendation from the Director of the Engglish
Commerce at Amadabat. He was not at home, but I found him on the River side looking
on some Workmen he had about a Ship which was then a building. He receiv'd the
Letters with much civility, and having caused me to sit down by him, he enquired after my
health, the success of my Travels, and the Design I was engaged in. He was a Mahumtan,
and spoke to me at first by the means of my Interpreter; but having learnt from him??? that
I understood the Turkish Language, he would make no further use of the Brocker, and spoke
to me in that. I told him, that I had not met with any misfortune by the way, and that I
intended to be gone the next morning, as having no further business that might detain me
at Cambaya, and that I had not stayed there that day, had it not been for the honour of seeing
him,The Civility of an Indosthan Mahumetan. and delivering him the Letters directed to him. He made answer, that it very much
troubled him, that the small stay I intended to make at Cambaya, permitted him not to express
what he would do for me, not only upon the account of the Letters I had brought
him from his Friend, but also upon that of my own merit.
               While we were engaged in these Complements, came up to us the Kings Lieutenant,
who alighting, saluted me with much civility. Having made the same questions to me as the
Merchant had done before, and receiv'd the same answer I had made the other, he told me,
I should do him a great kindness, if I gave him a visit at his own Lodgings, which I promised
to do. Myrsabeg told me, that he would come, and know of me, wherein he
might serve me, and so I took leave of them both, with a design to spend the remainder

of the morning in walking about the City. As I rose from dinner were brought in the
Presents of Myrsabeg, which were two Muttons, twelve Capons and Pullets, a basket of
Eggs, a Paner of Cocos, a great bundle of Sugar-canes, and a very fair Vessel of Agat. I
requited his pains who conducted ose that brought in the Present, with a small acknowledgment,
and told him, I would not fail coming to thank his Master. I thought to have
done it the next morning, but he prevented me, and surpriz'd me, giving order for my departure.
He told me, it would have troubled him much, I should have departed ere he
had taken leave of me. I thank'd him for the honour he did me, and the Presents he had
sent me, and intreated him to accept of a Pocket-pistol, made at London, which was a very
neat one, excusing my self, that as to the condition I was then in, it was impossible for me to
acknowledge, as I would desire, the kindness he had shewn me. He made answer, that it
was unhandsome to receive Presents from a Stranger, but that it would be a greater incivility
to refuse what I proffer'd him, that he was far from deserving what I then made him,
but being bestow'd with so much kindness and obligation, he could by no means forbear
accepting of it.
               I give a particular account of this answer, that the Reader may judge thereby, whether
those persons who are so well furnish'd with Complements of this Natre, should be look'd
on as Barbarians: and no doubt but he will be much more surpriz'd, when I shall tell him,
that there is more civility to be found among the Indians, then there is among those who
pretend to the sole possession of it, but seldom accompany it with the sincerity which ever
attends it in the Indies, where such as are friends, are such without any shiness or reservation,
to those to whom they have promised friendship, as they are, on the other side, irreconcileable
enemies to such as have injur'd them.
               I intreated Myrsabeg to sit down, and caus'd to be presented to him a Box of Bettel??Bettel??. according
to the custom of the Country, where they never entertain any friend, but there is
of that Drug brought him, it being so commonly used all over the Indies, as that Bread
cannot be more in Europe; in so much, that it may be truly said, that it is one of the most
advantageous, and most considerable things of any produced in the Indies. The Malabares
call it Bettel??, the Inhabitants of Guzuratta, Pam, and those of Malaca, Sir. Avicann, an
Arabian Physician, calls it Tambul. Its predominant qualities are hot and dry, and it is a
Plant, whose leaves are like those of the Orange-tree, save that they are not quite so broad,
and when they are in their full ripeness, they are of a brownish red colour. The stalk of
the Plant is very weak, whence it comes that it is supported by a stake, or set near some
other tree, to which it clings and spreads about the branches, as Ivy does??? It is commonly
joyn'd to that Tree which they call Areca, upon this account, that the Indians never use
the leaves of Bettel?? without the fruit of Areca.Areca. This Plant is very delicate, and must be
cultivated with much care and tenderness, especially as to the watering of it; for it must
not have either too much heat, or too much moisture, in as much as it is observed, that it
grows not in hot places, such as Mozambique and Zoffala, nor yet in cold Countries; as for
instance, in the more Northerly Provinces of China. It does not bring forth any fruit in
Guzuratta, but in Malacca it does, in form like a Lizards tail, and the Inhabitants eat of it,
and think it not unpleasant??? In all other places it brings forth only leaves, which are sold
in bundles by the dozen, and they keep fresh a long time. The Indians eat of them at any
time of the day, as also in the night, both men and women, insomuch that no person of any
mean condition, but spends two or three dozen of leaves a day. But in regard this Drug
is of it self very bitter, they put into every leaf an Areca-nut, the predominant qualities
whereof are cold and dry. This is that which Avicenna calls Faufel, and the Tree that
bears it is not much less then that of the Cocos, which is commonly called the Indian Palm-tree.
The Husk wherein the Fruit is enclosed, is smooth on the out-side, but within rugged
and downy, as that of the Cocos, and the Fruit it self is of the bigness of a Wall-nut,
but the kernel is no bigger then a Nutmeg, which is not much unlike, not only without,
but also as to the veins, which are to be seen when it is cut. They mingle with it some of
that Lime which is made of the Shells of Muscles, and sochew them together to get out
the juyce of it, which they swallow, and spit out what remains in their mouths. They
use it at any time of the day, but especially after meals, as conceiving it promots digestion
and prevents vomiting. Those Forreigners that have liv'd any time in the Indies, accustom
themselves thereto out of complyance, but above all, the Portuguez Women at Goa,
who are perpetually employ'd about this Exercise, chewing this Drug, as Cows and such
other Cattel chew the Cud. It does indeed discolour the Teeth, which by the frequent
use of it become of a red colour; but that is one of the Beauties of the Indian Women.
No corner of a Street but it may be had ready prepar'd, so that a man need not to be troubled
about the quantity he is to make use of. Great Lords have it brought after them in

Boxes of Lacque or Silver, and take of it as they go along the Streets, nay many times
when they are about business of consequence, and that in any place. They are also of a
belief, that this Drug fortifies the natural heat, and accordingly account it one of their delicacies;
upon which account it is, that they abstain from it when they are in affliction, and
particularly when the Moguls and Mahumetans celebrate their Fasts.
               Myrsabeg having taken a little of it, took leave of me, and I got into my Coach, intending
to call on the Kings Lieutenant at his own house, as I pass'd by, in regard I was to go by
his door: but I met him in the Street in his Coach, there being carried before him three
Banners of Taffata, Red and Green, charg'd with flames of Silver; as soon as he perceived
me, he turn'd his Coach, and oblig'd me to go along with him to his House. His House
was seated in the most delightful quarter of the City, having two Gates to enter in at, one
whereof led into a spacious Court, the other into a fair Garden, about the Walls where of
there was one continued structure. He treated me with Bettel?? and Palm-wine; but
having time little enough to perform the journey I intended that day, I staid not with him
above half an hour. He sent one of his Menial servants after me to give order to the
Officer of the Custom-house, and the Guards at the Gate, that I might pass without paying
ought.
               I came in the Evening to Serguntra,Comes to Serguntra. but it was so late, that the Benjans, who burn no
Candles for fear that Flies and such other Insects might be destroyed thereby, would not
open their Shops to sell me any forrage for my Beasts. It is much different from what is
commonly used in Europe;What they keep travelling Beasts with. For the Country bringing forth no Oats, and very little Grass,
they accustom their Beasts to another kind of sustenance, and keep them with a certain
Paste, which they make up of Sugar and Meal, into which they sometimes put a little Butter.
We were going to break open one of their Shops, but ere we had done any harm, one
of the Benjans brought us some forrage.
               The next day before noon, we travell'd five Leagues to a great Village, where we baited
our Beasts, giving to each of the Oxen a pound and a half, and to the Horses two pounds
of Sugar,Tzietbagh Garden. mixt with Meal. Thence we got to the Garden of Tzietbagh, where we baited
again.
               This Garden, which, no doubt, is the most delightful of any in the Indies, is also the most
considerable of any in the whole Country, not only in regard of the Victory which the
Mogul gain'd in that place, over the last King of Guzuratta, as we have mentioned before,
and which gave it the name of Tzietbagh, that is to say, the Garden of Victory; but also in
respect of its magnificent Structures, and the noble Fruits which grow there in great abundance.
It is seated in one of the most pleasant places in the world, upon the
side of a great Pool, having on the side toward the water several Pavillions??? and on that
towards Amadabat, a very high Wall. The sumptuousness of the buildings speaks
the great Spirit of the Prince that founded it, as doth also the Caravansera adjoyning
thereto.
               There are in the Garden many Allyes of Fruit-trees; as Orange and Citro-trees of
all sorts, Pomegranate-trees, Date-trees, Almond-trees, Mulberry-trees, the Trees which
bear Tamarinds, Mangas, and Cocos, besides many other not known to us; and there
was such abundane of them, and they were planted so close, that we could walk about the
Garden in the shae, which was a great refreshing to us: The branches of all these Trees were
infinitely stor'd with Apes, which added not a little to he divertisment and satisfaction
of our walk. We staid no longer in it then while our Horses were baiting, in regard we
were resolv'd to get that day to Amadabat, whither we came at night. I was that day on
horse-back, and by way of sport, would needs frighten the Apes, which plaid a thousand
tricks about us, in so much that we began to think them troublesome. I shot two of them
with my Pistol, whereat the rest were so incensed, that they seem'd to conspire together,
as if they had a design to set upon us. Their cries and distorted looks discover'd how much
they were inclin'd to do us some mischief, in so much that about twenty of the biggest of
them followed us for above half a League; but perceiving us ready to turn towards them,
they got among the Trees, and at last gave over their pursuit of us.
               Coming to Amadabath, I met with a Caffila, or Caravan, of about 200. Merchants, English
and Benjans, which was going to Agra, the chief City of all the Mogul's country. The
English President had ordered him,Goes for Agra. who had the conduct of the Caravan, to take me along
with him, and the Director of the Commerce at Amadabath, added thereto his particular
recommendations; so that those Merchants received me into their company, and I went
along with them thence on the 28. of October.
               The weather and the way were very fair, but I met with so few Villages, that the first
I have any account to give of, was that of Paingat; and the sixth day after our departure

from Amadabath, we came to the City of Heribath, which is fifty Leagues distant from it.
This City is not very big,Heribath. and hath neither Gates nor Walls, as having been razed by Temurleng,
or Tamberlane, as had been also the Castle, whereof the ruines are yet to be seen
upon a high Mountain,Damtiges. not far from the City. Between this City and that of Damtiges,
which is distant from that of Heribath other fifty Leagues, we met a Caffila of Benjan Merchants,
who told us, they had been set upon by 200. High-way-men, of the Rasboutes, who
had forc'd them to ransom themselves at a hundred Ropias, and that we should do well to
stand upon our guard, inasmuch as the day before they had seen a hundred more of them,
who having understood from them what they had paid their Camrades, had siad no more to
them, and only took away one of their Oxen; but that they were gone to joyn with the
former, and that they would not fail to set upon us. We made our advantage of this Intelligence,
and caused our Waggons to be fastned together, and the Souldiers that guarded
them were so disposed, as that they might relieve one another, without the least fear of
any disorder. Near a certain Village we met with fifty of those rascally Companions, but
they thought us so well arm'd, and so resolv'd to stand upon our advantage to defend our
selves, that they passed by without saying ought to us, yet discovering withall by their
march, that they were come only to take a view of us. We understood afterwards, how
that returning by the same Village, they had said, that if we had been at a little further distance
from it, they would have disputed the way with us.
               Fifty Leagues thence, we came near a Village called Syedck, which had in it a very
strong Castle. And whereas most of our Beasts were extreamly wearied, by reason of the
great dayes journeys we had made, we ordered that some of the Oxen and Waggons
should go before. But they were hardly got into a little bottom that was in the way, not
above six hundred paces from us, ere they were set upon by ten Rasboutes, who had lain
in ambush behind a little Hill and at the first onset wounded two Benjans, and were driving
away the Waggons, which they had before turn'd out of the Road, when we discovered
them aftar off, and sent to them some of our Souldiers, who forced the Robbers to forsake
what they had taken.Comes to Agra. After this we met with no misfortune, and came safely to Agra,
where I took up my quarters among the English, whose Civilities to me here were consonant
to what I had received from them in other places.
               The Mogul, or great King of Indosthan, does often change the place of his abode, insomuch
that there is no City in all his Kingdom, of any considerable account, where he hath
not his Palaces;Agra described. but he delights not so much in any as Agra, which, to do it right, is indeed
the noblest City in all his Dominions. It lies 28. degrees on this side the Line, in the
Province of Indosthan, upon the River Gemini, which falls into the Ganges, above the Kingdom
of Bengala. It is at least twice as big as Ispahan, and it is as much as a Man can do to
ride about it on horse-back in a day. It is fortified with a good Wall, of a kind of red
Free-stone, and a Ditch, which is above thirty fathom broad. Its Streets are fair and spacious,
and there are some of them vaulted, which are above a quarter of a League in length,
where the Merchants and Tradesmen have their Shops, distinguished by their Trades and
the Merchandises which are there sold; every Trade, and every Merchant having a particular
Street and Quarter assigned him.It hath its Merket-places. There are in it fifteen Meidans and Basars, whereof
the most spacious is that which is before the Castle, where may be seen sixty great Guns of
all sizes, but not kept in any order so as to be made use of. There is also in that place a
high Pole, as at the Meidan of Ispahan, where the Court Lords, and sometimes the Mogul
himself divert themselves with shooting at the Parrot fastned at the top of it. There are in
the City fourscore Caravanseras,80. Caravanseras. for the accommodation and convenience of Forreign Merchants,
most of them three Stories high, with very noble Lodgings, Store-houses, Vaults and
Stables belonging to them, together with Galleries and private Passages for the correspondence
and communication of the Chambers. Every one of them hath a certain person,
whose charge it is to lock them up, and to take care that the Merchandises be safely kept.
He does also supply the place of a Sutler, and sels all sorts of Provision, Forrage, and Wood,
to those that lodge in them.
               And whereas the Mogul, and most of the greatest Lords about his Court, profess the Mabumetan
Religion,Mosquey. there is also in Agra a very great number of Metschid, or Mosqueys, and
among the rest seventy great ones, of which the six principal they call Metschid-adine, because
that it is in them they do their Devotions of Holy-dayes.
               In one of these last named, is to be seen the Sepulchre of one of their Saints, called Seander,
and they say he is of the Posterity of Aaly.The Sepulchre of a Gyant. In another of them may be seen the Sepulchre
of another Saint, who being 30. foot in length, and 16. in breadth, must needs have
been one of the mightiest Gyants that ever were talk'd of. His Tomb was cover'd all over

with little Flags, and we were told he had been one of their Heroes, who had sometime
done wonders in the wars. To this place there are great Pilgrimages made, insomuch
that the Devotions of the Pilgrims do, by the Offerings they make, very much augment
the wealth of that Mosquey, the Revenue whereof is very great without those advantages.
There are daily maintain'd in it a great number of poor people, so that it may be truly said,
that the Devotions done there are not inferiour to those done at the Sepulchre of Schich
Sefi at Ardebil.Sanctuaries These Metzids, and the Courts which depend on them, serve also for so
many Sanctuaries to persons guilty of any capital Crimes, as also to such as fear imprisonment
for their Debt. These are the Allacapi of the Persians, and are called by the Indians,
Allader, and the priviledges of them in the Indies, are equal to those the Allacapi are endued
with in Persia, insomuch that the Mogul himself, though his power be absolute, cannot
force a man out of these Sanctuaries, be his crime of ever so heynous a nature, by reason of
the Veneration which these people have for their Saints.
               There are numbred in the City of Agra above eight hundred Baths,800. Baths. or Hot-houses, from
which there comes in yearly to the Mogul a very considerable sum of money, occasioned
hence, that this kind of Purification making one of the principal parts of their Religion,
there passes not a day, but that these places are frequented by an infinite number of
persons.
               The great Lords about the Court, who are called Rasgi, or Rajas, have their Houses and
Palaces in the City, besides their Country-houses, all magnificent, both as to structure and
houshold-stuffe. The King hath several Gardens and Houses without the City, whither he
often retires himself with his Women-dancers, who dance before him stark naked. But there
is not any thing gives a greater demonstration of the greatness of this Monarch, then his
Palace, which stands upon the River Gemini, and is near four Leagues about. It is excellently
well fortified,The Mogul's Palace described. according to the fortification of that Country, with a Wall of Free-stone,
and a great Ditch, having at every Gate a Draw-bridge, the Avenues whereof are
also very well fortified, especially at the North-gate. The Gate which leads to the Basar
is on the West-side, and is called Cistery. Under this Gate is the Diwan, or the place
of publick Judicature; and there is adjoyning to it a spacious Hall, where the principal
Visier dispatches and seals all Orders for the ordinary and extraordinary Levies of men,
whereof the Originals are kept at the said place. As soon as a man is come within this
Gate, he finds himself in a spacious Street, having Shops on both sides, which leads directly
to the Mogul's Palace, which is called Derbar. The Gate by which a man enters into it is
called Achobarke Derwage, that is to say, King Achobar's Gate, and there is such a respect
observed at it, as that, the Kings Sons only excepted, all other Lords, what quality soever
they are of, are obliged to alight from their Horses, and to go in a foot. It is in this quarter
that the Women are lodged, who divert the King and his Family with their singing and
dancing.The Mogul worships the Sun. The fourth Gate, which is called Dersame, leads to the River, and thither it is
that the Mogul comes every morning to worship the Sun at his rising. It is on that side
also, that the Grandees of the Kingdom, who are about the Court, come every day to do
their submissions to the King, going up to a little eminent place, whence the King may
take the more particular notice of them. The Hadys, or Commanders of Horse, do also
give their attendance there, but they stand at a greater distance, and make not their approaches,
but upon the Kings express Order, who comes also to this place to see the fighting
of the Lyons, Elephants, Bulls and other wild Beasts, it being his ordinary divertisement
every day, Friday only excepted, which he spends in his Devotions. Besides all this,
there is yet another Gate, which leads into the Guard-Hall, which they call Attesanna,
where the Officers keep a Guard, and relieve one the other by weeks. There is a passage
through this Hall into a paved Court, at the further end whereof there is, under a Portal,
a row of silver Pillars, where there stands a particular Guard, which keeps the people from
getting within it, and permits only the Great Lords that belong to the Court to enter
there.
               There it was I met with the Persian Servant who run away from me at Suratta, and
who proffered me to do me any service lay in his power, during my aboad at Agra; nay,
would have brought me within the Pillars before mentioned, but the Guards would not
permit it.The Mogul's Throne. A man must go within these Pillars to get to the Mogul's Chamber, where may
be seen, within another row of lesser Pillars, all of Gold, the Throne of that great Prince,
made of massie Gold, and enrich'd with Diamonds, Pearls, and other precious Stones.
Above the Throne there is a Gallery, where the King shews himself every day, and receives
their Complaints who have any violence or injury done them. Those who have any
Complaints to make, ring one of the little Bells which are hung up above those Pillars;
but unless a man have excellent good Evidence to prove what he alledges, it will be dangerous

to offer at it, for he will hazard his own life. The Kings Sons only, who give
him Air with a kind of Fan, and keep off the Flies, and the Grand Visier, are permitted to
come within those Pillars;The Seraglio. and there is no person to go into any of the inner Lodgings,
but the Godia, or Eunuchs, who wait on the Ladies of the Seraglio, and are in number about
a thousand or twelve hundred.
               There is also within this Castle another Appartment, which is known by a great Tower,
the covering whereof is of Gold, which shews what excessive wealth is enclosed within it,
in eight spacious Vaults, which are full of Gold, Silver and precious Stones whereof the
value is in a manner inestimable.
               I was credibly informed,The Mogul's Treasurer. that the Mogul, who lived in my time, had a Treasure, which
amounted to above fifteen hundred Millions of Crowns; and I have an Inventory of the
Treasure which was found at the death of Schach Achobar, gret Grand-father of Schach
Choram, as well in coyned Gold and Silver, as in Lingots and Bars, Plate, precious Stones,
Brocadoes and other Stuffes, Purcelane Books, Ammunition, Armes, &c. so faithfully
drawn up, that for the Readers further satisfaction, I shall not think it amiss to insert it
here.
               This King Achobar had ordered the Coynage of a certain sort of Money of 25. 50. and
a hundred Toles,A sort of money of eight thousand Crowns the piece. which amounted to two thousand twelve and a half, four thousand twenty
five, and eight thousand and fifty Crowns the piece, which was coined accordingly, to the

               But this came not any thing near the Treasure which Scach Choram was possessed of, at
the time of my Travels in those Parts. This Wealth is more and more augmented every
day, not so much out of the ordinary Revenue coming in from the great Kingdoms he
hath, (in regard that as his ordinary Expence abates not any thing of his Treasure; so
is it seldom seen that he increases it, by ought remaining at the years end of his Revenue)
as by the Presents which are made him, and the Escheats falling to him at the death of
great Lords and Favourites, who make the Mogul Heir to what they had gotten by his
Favour, insomuch that the Children have no hope to enjoy ought of their Fathers Estates,
either Real or Personal. For the Mogul's Authority is such, and his Power so Absolute,
that the Estates of all his Subjects are at his disposal; and thence it comes, that only his
will decides all differences arising among them, they having no other Law, then implicitely
to submit to what he ordians. He hath the absolute disposal of their Lives and Fortunes,
and thence it is, that upon his meer Order and Command, the greatest Lords
are dragg'd to Execution, and their Estates, Charges, and Governments taken away from
them.
               There is no hereditary Dignity in all his Country.No hereditary charge or dignity in the Mogul's Countrey. That of Rasgi, or Raja, which he
bestows rather upon the account of Merit then Birth, is Personal, as that of Chan in Persia,
and is not deriv'd to Posterity, but by the recommendation of Vertue. Not that it is to
be inferred hence, that the Mogul does exclude from Charges the Children of such as have
done him good service; but he gives them lesser charges, by which they may advance
themselves to the chiefest in the Kingdom, if either an extraordinary Vertue, or the Princes
Favour call them thereto.
               The chiefest Offices of the Kingdom are those of principal Visir,The chief Officers. which is somewhat
like that of Chancellourship elsewhere; Chief of the Eunuchs, who is as it were Lord
High Steward; the Treasurer, the principal Secretary of State; the General of the Elephants,
and the Overseer of the Houshold-stuffe, Tents and precious Stones. These are
of the Princes Privy Council, whereto is sometimes also called the Couteval, who is as it
were the chief Judge, and commands the Mogul's Guard. The Council sits in the night,
from seven of the clock till nine, in a Hall, which they call Gasalean. No day almost
passes, but the Mogul is to be seen, in the morning, at Sun-rising, at which time the Lords
of the Court salute him with their Patschach Salammet; as also about Noon, when he
comes to see the Beasts fight, and in the Evening, when he comes to a certain Window
to behold the Sun-setting; with whom he retires himself with the noise of a great number
of Drums and Timbrels, and the Acclamations of the people, who wish him a long
and happy life.
               It is to be found among the Registers of the Kingdom,The Mogul's Revenue. that only the Provinces of Candahar,
Cabul, Guzuratta, Cassimer, Barampour, Dely, Bengala, Agra, Orixa, and some
others, bring in of yearly Revenue, one hundred seventy four Millions, and five hundred
thousand Ropias, which amount to fourscore and seven Millions, and two hundred and
fifty thousand Crowns; and that the Province of Guzuratta alone is able to raise fourscore
and ten thousand Horse; Cambaya twelve thousand; Kabul as many; Orixa fourscore
thousand; and Dely one hundred and fifty thousand; besides those which may be
raised out of the other Provinces, whereof I could get no certain Accompt. All this

Militia is divided into several Regiments, whereof some are of fifteen or twelve thousand
Horse, which are for the Kings Sons, and the principal Persons of the Kingdom,
who have also the Command of these Bodies, which consist of but two, three, or four thousand
Horse.
               The Mogul, Scach Choram, when he went in Person, in the year 1630. against Chan
Chaan, had an Army of one hundred forty four thousand and five hundred Horse, besides
Elephants, Camels, Mules, and Horses for the Train. That Army was divided into four
Brigades, which yet kept all together, that only excepted which was about the Kings Person
at Barampour. The first was commanded by Schaaft-Chan, the Son of Assaph-Chan,
and consisted of several Regiments, to wit, that of Schaaft-Chan, which was of five thousand
Horse.
               
                  5000
                  That of his Father consisting also of five thousand Horse, all Rasboutes: 5000

loose Companies. 4600
               
               The second Body, under the Command of Eradet-Chan, consisted of the
following Regiments.

                  So that this Body consisted of 28000
               
               The third Body, under the Command of Raja Gedsing, consisted of the
following Regiments,

they call Ommeraudes. 10000
                  The total of the Horse 62500
               
               The offensive Arms of the Horse are,The Arms of the Cavalry the Bow, the Quiver, having in it forty or fifty
Arrows, the Javeline, of a kind of long-headed-Pike, which they dart with great exactness,
the Cymitar on one side, and the Ponyard on the other: and the defensive is the Buckler,
which they have alwayes hanging about their necks.
               They have no Fire-Arms with Wheels, nor yet Fire-locks, but their Infantry are expert
enough at the Musket. Those among the Foot, who have no Muskets, have besides their
Bows and Arrows, a Pike ten or twelve foot long, with which they begin the fight, by
darting it at the Enemy; instead of using it in opposition to the Horse, as is done in Europe.
Some among them have Coats of Mail about them, which come down to their knees:
but there are very few make use of Head-pieces, in regard they would be very troublesome,
by reason of the excessive heats in those parts.Observe no order in fighting. They know nothing of the distinction
of Van-guard, main Battle, and Rear-guard, and understand neither Front nor File, nor
make any Battalion, but fight confusedly without any Order.
               Their greatest strength consists in the Elephants, which carry on their backs certain
Towers of Wood, wherein there are three or four Harquebuses hanging by hooks, and as
many Men to order that Artillery. The Elephants serve them for a Trench, to oppose the
first attempt of the Enemy, but it often comes to pass, that the Artificial Fires, which are
made use of to frighten these Creatures, put them into such a disorder, that they do much
more mischief among those who brought them to the Field, then they do among the Enemies.
They have abundance of Artillery,Their Artillery. and some considerable great Pieces, and such
as whereof it may be said, the invention of them is as ancient as that of ours. They also
make Gun-powder, but it is not fully so good as what is made in Europe. Their Timbrels
and Trumpets are of Copper, and the noise they make, in order to some Military
Action, is not undelightful. Their Armies do not march above five Cos, or Leagues,
according to the measure of the Country, in a day; and when they encamp, they
take up so great a quantity of ground, that they exceed the compass of our greatest
Cities.
               In this they observe an admirable Order,The order of their Armies. inasmuch as there is no Officer nor Souldier,
but knows where he is to take up his Quarters; nor can there be any City more regularly
divided into Streets, Markets and other publick places, for the greater communication and
convenience of the Quarters, and for the distribution of Provisions.
               The Mogul, and the General of the Army, have their Tents pitched at a certain distance
from those of the rest, nay, as far as a Musket will carry, from those of their own
Guards.
               The Mogul's ordinary Guard consists of twelve thousand men,The Mogul's Guard. besides the six hundred,
who are the particular Guard of the body, the Company whereof consists of so many

young men, whom he buyes, and causes to be exercised in Armes, that they may be perpetually
about his Person.
               The Rasgi, Rajas,The dignity of the Rajas. or Radias, are never advanced to that Dignity, but upon the score of
Merit. The Mogul bestows it also on the Chancellour, or principal Visir, who is the President
of his Privy Councel, and as it were Vice-Roy of all his Dominions, inasmuch as
he it is who sends Orders into all the Provinces of the Kingdom; and it is to him that all
are to make their Addresses in all Affairs of importance. The King permits him not to
receive any Presents; yet does he not forbear taking them underhand, and his Secretaries
and other Officers under him take them so openly, that there is no, ever so secret, transaction,
but a man may have the particulars thereof, if he hath money to bestow among those
who have the transcription and dispatch of them. These Rasgi have so great a Veneration
for their King, that it were impossible for a man to approach things most sacred with
more submission, then they express when they speak to him. The discourses they entertain
him with are intermingled and interrupted with continual Reverences; and when
they take their leave of him, they bow down their heads, put their hands over their eyes,
thence afterwards upon their breasts, and at last touch the ground therewith, to shew they
are but dust and athes in comparison of him, wishing him all prosperity, and coming out of
his presence backwards.
               When the Mogul marches in Person in the head of his Army,The Mogul ordinary retinue. or when he comes out of
the City to go a hunting, or to take the Air, he is attended by above ten thousand men. In
the head of this little Army, there march above a hundred Elephants, with their covering
Clothes of Scarlet, Velvet, or Brocadoe. Every Elephant carries two Men, one whereof
governs and guides the Creature, by touching his forehead with an Iron-hook, the other
carries a large Banner of Silk, embroidered with Gold and Silver; excepting only the seven
or eight foremost, which carry each of them one that playes on the Timbrel. The
King himself is mounted on an excellent Persian Horse, or goes in a Coach, drawn by two
white Oxen, the Horns whereof, which are very large, are adorn'd with Gold; or some
times he is carried by several men in a Palanquin, or kind of Sedan. The Rasgi and the
Officers of the Court march after him, and have coming behind them five or six hundred
Elephants,He changes the place of his abode according to the seasons. Camels or Waggons loaded with baggage. For the most part he takes up his
Quarters in the Fields, where he causes his Tents to be pitched; which is done upon this
account, that as on the one side there are but few Cities, where he might find necessary
accommodations for the quarters and entertainment of the Court, so on the other, he takes
a particular pleasure in encamping, in the Summer time, in cool places; in the Winter, in
hot places; insomuch that he is in some sort the Master of the Seasons, as well as of all the
other things which are subject to him. He commonly leaves Agra towards the end of
April, and retires near Labor, or some other more Northerly Province, where he passes over
the moneths of May, Iune, Iuly and August; and then he returns again to the place of his
ordinary residence.
               The City of Agra is of such extent and so populous,The City of Agra described. that were there a necessity, there
might be rais'd out of it two hundred thousand men able to bear Arms. There is no Nation
in all the East, but hath some Commerce or other at this place; but most of the Inhabitants
are Mahumetans, and all the Merchandizes that are imported into it, or exported
out of it, pay ten in the hundred.
               There are above forty small Cities, and above three thousand five hundred Villages that
depend on the jurisdiction of Agra, which extends it self above sixscore Leagues about.
The Country is delightful and very fertile, producing abundance of Indico, Cotton, Salt-Peter
and other things, wherewith the Inhabitants drive a vast Trade. There are two Festivals
which are celebrated in this place, with extraordinary Ceremonies; one whereof is
that of the first day of the year, which, with the Persians, they call Naurus, Nauros, or
Norose, which signifies nine dayes, though now it last eighteen at least, and it falls at the moment
that the Sun enters Aries.
               In order to the celebration of this Festival,How the Mogul celebrates the first day of the year. before the Derbar, or Kings Palace, there is
erected a Theatre, fourteen foot high, fifty six in length, and forty in breadth; having all
about it a row of Pillars after the manner of a Balcony, cover'd with rich Tapistry. Near
this Theatre there is erected another building of painted wood, and embellish'd with Mother
of Pearl, into which go some of the principal Lords about the Court, who nevertheless
have their Tents pitch'd in the first Court of the Palace, filled with all they have that
is rich and magnificent, whereof they make the greatest Ostentation they can that day:
The Predecessors of this Prince, who now reigns, were wont to go into all these Tents, and
to take thence any thing they liked; but now the Ceremony is otherwise. For the King
accompanied by the seven Ministers of State, go up into the Theatre, where he sits upon

Velvet Cushions, enbroidered with Gold and Pearls, and stayes for the Presents which are
to be made to him. The Queen is in a certain Gallery, whence she sees all the Ceremony,
yet is not seen her self. Departing thence, he sits upon his Ordinary Throne, where he
receives the Presents of the people, which he continues to do for eighteen dayes together.
Towards the end of the Festival, the King in his turn makes his Presents to the Lords,
which consists in Charges, Employments, and new Honours, which he distributes among
those that have given him most.
               The Mogul's birth-day is celebrated with the Ceremonies following.The Festival of the Mogul's birth-day. He begins the
day with all manner of divertisements; which over, he goes to the Palace of the Queen
his Mother, if she be living, and causes many Presents to be made her by the Grandees of
his Kingdom. After dinner he puts on the richest clothes he hath, and covers himself all
over with Gold and precious Stones, and being thus rather loaden then adorn'd with inestimable
wealth, he goes into a Tent, where he is expected by the Lords of the Court, in
which finding a pair of Scales, he weighs himself. These Scales are of massy Gold, as are
also the Chains by which they hang, and are all beset with precious Stones. He puts himself
into one of the Scales, and into the other there are put several bags of Silver, one bag
of Gold, some precious Stones, some pieces of Silk-stuffs, Linnen cloath, Pepper, Cloves,
Nutmeg and Cinnamon, Wheat, Pulse and Herbs, and there is an exact account kept of
the difference of weight there may be between one year and another. The King gives away
with his own hands, all the money among the poor, and the rest are bestowed on the
Benjans. That done, the King seats himself in his Throne, and causes to be cast among
the Grandees, Nuts, Pistachoes, Almonds, and several other Fruits of Gold, but so finely
wrought, that a thousand of them weighed not thirty Crowns. This some would boggle
much to admit for a Truth; yet certain it is that it hath been seen, that the value of ten
Crowns bestowed in these trifles, filled a great Basin of them; so that all the liberality of
this powerful Monarch could not amount to a hundred Crowns. The Festival is concluded
with a great Feast, at which the Mogul entertains the Lords of his Court, with whom
he passes away the night in drinking.
               They celebrate also another Festival,Another Mahumetan Feast. which they begin ten dayes after the new Moon of
the moneth of Iuly, much after the same manner as the Persians celebrate their Aschur.
The Indians observe this Festival in honour of two Brethren, named Ianze, and Iawze,
servants to Haly, who being gone in Pilgrimage to a particular place of Devotion, upon
the Coast of Coromandel, the Bramans, and other Pagans of those parts set upon them, and
forc'd them to retreat into a Castle, where they besieg'd them: These holy Persons maintain'd
the Siege a long time; but being resolv'd not to drink of the Water which the
Pagans had prophan'd by casting a Lizard into it, a Creature for which the Mahumetans
have an aversion, because of its uncleanness, they took a resolution to make a sally upon
the besiegers, and killed many of them, but at last they were overcome by the great number
of their enemies, who left them dead upon the place. There are carried about the
City, Coffins covered with Bows and Arrows, Turbants, Cymitars, and Garments of Silk,
which the people accompany with sobbings and lamentations, in commemoration of the
death of those holy Persons. Some among them dance at the Ceremony, others strike
their Swords one against another; nay, there are those who cut and slash themselves, so
as that the bloud comes out in several places, wherewith they rub their clothes, and by
that means represent a very strange procession. Towards night they set up several Figures
of men, made of Straw, to personate the Murtherers of those Saints; and having shot a
great many Arrows at them, they set them on fire, and reduce them to ashes. And this they
do with so much fury and animosity, that should there be any of the Pagans in the Streets
at that time, they would run the hazard of their lives; whence it comes, that during these
Ceremonies, they stir not out of their houses.
               The Mahumetans of those parts celebrate also another Feast in the moneth of Iune, in
memory of the sacrifice of Abraham, at which they kill He-Goats, which they eat at the
Entertainments they make among themselves that day.
               Certain it is,The Mogul comes from Tamerlan. that the Mogul stands very much upon his descent, in a direct and masculine
I ne, from Temirlanque, that is to say, Temir, the lame, who is commonly called Tamerlan,
who was of the Family of Chinguis-Chan, King of Tartary. Scach Choram, who was
living at my being in those parts, was a younger Son of Scach Iahan's, and had usurped
the Crown from Prince Polagi, his Nephew, whom we found at Caswin at our coming into
Persia. He might be then about sixty years of Age, and had three Sons, whereof the Elder
was about 25. years of age; but he had not the affection he should have had for him,
since it was his intention to have the youngest declar'd Heir of the Crown of Indosthan,
and to leave the two elder Brethren the command of certain Provinces. The initials of

his Government had been cruel and bloudy,The initials of his Government cruel. but he was very much reclaim'd from those
courses, though he yet ever and anon betrayed his inclinations to severity, in the torments
he put those persons to who were guilty of High Treason, whom he caused to be flead
alive, or torn in pieces by wild Beasts. In other things he was of an humour good enough,
being a great lover of Entertainments, Musick and Dancing, especially that of common
Prostitutes, who often danced stark naked in his presence, and diverted him by all manner
of extravagant postures.
               The English told me a Story, which I think so pleasant, that I shall not think it much to
digress so far as to insert it here.A pleasant story of the Mogul. This King had a particular affection for a certain Rasgi,
who upon the account of his courage, and the pleasantness of his coversation, was grown
so considerable about the Court, that there hardly passed a day, but the King sent for him.
One day the King asking some that were about him, why that Lord was not come to the
Court; and answer being made him, that he had taken Physick, he sent to him a company
of those Women-dancers, and commanded them to strip themselves stark naked, and to
ease their Natures before him. The Rasgi having notice brought him of their arrival,
ordered them to be conducted to his Chamber, imagining the Mogul had sent them purposely
to give him some divertisement; but understanding what they were ordered to do,
and perceiving thereby that the King was in a good humour, and desirous to make himself
sport, he resolved to put a trick upon him, and so to laugh at those who would have laughed
at him.
               Having ask'd the Women-dancers what commands the King had laid upon them, and
heard their answer, he afterwards asked them whether they were ordered to do any thing
else, and being inform'd they had order to do nothing but what they had told him before,
he bid them put the Kings Command in execution with all the exactness they could, but
that they should have a special care not to exceed it by doing any thing more, telling
them, that if they piss'd the least drop while they did their other business, he would have
them whipp'd till the bloud came. Not one of them would expose her self to that danger;
so that they thereupon returned to the Court, where they gave the King an account
how they had been entertain'd by the Rasgi. The Mogul was so taken with the
pleasant trick which the Rasgi had put upon him, that it put him into the best humour in
the world.
               His ordinary divertisement every day was to see the combats of Lyons, Bulls, Elephants,
Tigers,The Mogul divertisement. Leopards, and other wild Beasts, an argument of his cruel Nature, and bloudy Disposition,
which his perpetual seeing of this kind of combats did much heighten. He also
took a delight in seeing Men ingag'd with Beasts, but this was not but with their own
consent; and such as would venture their lives, out of a hope to gain that reputation of
Courage as should prove the raising of their Fortunes, were to make use of no Arms but
Sword and Buckler. This puts me in mind of a Combat which Scach Choram ordered to
be had, at the conclusion of a great Entertainment which he had made on the Birth-day
of his Son, who was King of Bengala, in a Caravansera without the City, at which place
were kept to this purpose all sorts of wild Beasts. This Caravansera had adjoyning to it a
spacious Garden encompassed with a wall, upon which the people were come to see that divertisement.
The first engagement was that of a wild Bull and a Lyon; and the next,
that of a Lyon and a Tiger.
               As soon as the Tiger perceiv'd the Lyon,A combat between a Lyon and a Tiger. he went straight towards him, and closing
with him with all his strength, got him down. 'Twas generally believed, it would be no
hard matter for the Tiger to make an end of the Lyon; but the Lyon immediately recover'd
himself, and took the Tiger so fast by the throat that he was thought dead: yet he
made a shift to disingage himself, and the combat was renewed with greater fury then before,
till at last weariness made both give over. They were both very much hurt, but the
wounds were not mortal on either side. Upon this, Allaemerdi-Chan, Governour of Chisemar,
who stood near the King, came forth and said, that Schach Choram was desirous to
see, whether there were among his Subjects, any one that had so much courage, as to engage
with any of those Beasts, and that only with a Sword and Buckler, and that he who
durst attempt it should appear, that the Mogul, having been an ocular witness of his worth,
might accordingly requite it, and honour him, not only with his favour, but also with the
quality of Chan. Upon which Proposition, three Indosthans proffering to undertake the
engagement, Allaemerdy-Chan told them further, that the Kings meaning was, that whoever
should undertake the Combat, should do it only with Sword and Buckler; and that
it was his pleasure, that those who had any Coats of Mail about them, should put them off,
that the Combat might be without any advantage.
               Upon these terms a furious Lyon was let forth, who perceiving his Adversary coming

into the place, made immediately towards him. The Indosthan made his party good very
stoutly, till at last, no longer able to bear the weight of the Beast, which lay very heavy
upon him on the left hand, he began to let fall his Buckler, which the Lyon endeavour'd all
he could to force from him, while with his left paw, he would have fastned on his enemies
right arm, and so have seiz'd him by the throat, when the Man, putting his hand to his
Girdle, pull'd out a Dagger, and thrust it so far into the Lyons jaws, that he was forced to
let go his hold, and get away. The Man followed him, and giving him a blow over the
mouth laid him all along, and afterwards kill'd him. The people made acclamations for his
happy victory over the Lyon; but as soon as the noise was over, the Mogul call'd the Indosthan
to him, and with an angry smile said to him, It must needs be confess'd thou art a
valiant man, and that thou hast fought very gallantly. But had I not forbidden thee to engage
against this Beast with any advantage? And had I not appointed what Arms thou shouldst
make use of? And yet thou hast done contrary to my Order, and hast not overcome my Lyon as a
Person of Honour, but hast surpriz'd him with forbidden Arms, and so hast killed him as a
murtherer, and not as a declar'd enemy. Whereupon he commanded two men to go down
into the Garden, and to rip up his belly; which was immediately put in execution, and
the Corps was set upon an Elephant to be carried through the City, to serve for an example
to others.
               He who,A Combat between a Man and a Tiger. upon this Tragedy, came next into play, went with an undaunted courage towards
a Tiger, which he was to engage with, in so much that his deportment was such as
raised in the minds of the Spectators a certain confidence of his obtaining the Victory.
But the Tigre, who it seems was too cunning for his Adversary, fastened on his throat, killed
him, and tore his body in pieces.
               The third Champion that came upon the Stage,A third Combat. instead of being any way frightned at
the misfortune of his two Camrades, came very chearfully and couragiously into the Garden,
and went straight towards the Tiger, who flesh'd with the precedent success, run at
his Adversary, with a design to make quick work with him; but the Indosthan, though a man
of low stature, and a wretched countenance, struck off at one blow the two fore-paws of
the Beast, and having by that means got him down, he soon dispatch'd him.
               The King immediately ask'd him his name;Courage rewarded. whereto he made answer that it was Geily;
whereupon there came in a Gentleman, who presenting him from the Mogul with a Garment
of Brocadoe, said to him, Geily, receive this Garment from my hands, as an assurance
of the Kings favour, who sends it thee as a pledge thereof. Geily, having made several low
reverences, putting the Garment to his eyes and breast, and afterwards holding it in the Air,
and having made a short Prayer to himself, he at last pronounc'd aloud to this effect; My
Prayers to God are, that the Mogul's glory may be equal to that of Tamerlan, from whom he
is descended; may his Arms prosper; may his Wealth be increased; may he live seven hundred
years, and may his House be established for ever. Upon this there came to him two
Eunuchs, who conducted him to the Kings Chamber, at the entrance whereof, two Chans
took him between them, and so brought him to the Kings feet. After he had kiss'd them,
and was rising up, the Mogul said to him; It must be confessed, Geily-Chan, that thou hast
done a very great and glorious Action. I bestow on thee that name and quality which thou
shalt enjoy for ever. I will be thy Friend, and thou shalt be my servant. Thus was the doing
of a single Action the Foundation of a mans Fortune, who was not so much as known
before, but grew famous afterwards, by the Charges he had in the Mogul's Armies.
               It was my design to make a little longer stay at Agra;Mandelslo discovered to have kill'd on Indosthan at Ispahan. but there happened an accident
which oblig'd me to change my Resolution, nay, forc'd me to leave a place where I thought
my life in danger. For being one day fallen into discourse with the Persian servant, who
ran away from me at Surat, I perceiv'd coming towards me an Indosthan, a person of a
goodly presence, and as far as I could judge, of quality, who immediately asked me whence
I came, and what business I had in those parts. I made him answer, that I was an Europaean,
that I came from Germany, and that the desire I had to see the Court of the most
powerful Monarch in all the East, had brought me thither. He told me, that if he were
not much mistaken, he had seen me at Ispaban, and that questionless I was the person that
had kill'd a Kinsman of his at the Engagement which had happened between the Indians
and the Germans. This discourse had almost put me out of countenance; but upon a little
recollection I told him, that I had never been in Persia, and that I came from England
by Sea to Surat, which the two English Merchants, who were then in my company, affirmed
to be true. But he who did me the greatest kindness in this extremity, was my old
Persian servant, who swore by his Mahomed, and by his Hossein, that what I had told him
was nothing but the truth. Whereupon the Indosthan went away, but discover'd by his
deportment, that he gave not over-much credit to what we had said: and for my part,

I conceiv'd it but prudence to be distrustful of a man who had expressed his good will, had
there been occasion, to do me a mischief, and would no doubt have revenged his Kinsmans
death, of which my conscience told me I was guilty.
               Upon these reflections I left Agra,Leaver Agra. with a Caffila, or Caravan, that was going to the City
of Lahor, which lies sixty Leagues further into the Country. I had the company of two
Dutch Merchants, and our travelling was so much the more pleasant, in that our way was
but one continued Alley, drawn in a streight line, and planted on both sides with Date-trees,
Palm-trees, Cocos-trees, and other kind of Fruit-trees, which gave us a continual refreshing
shade against the heat of the Sun. The sumptuous Houses which were to be seen
up and down the Country, the Apes, Peacocks, Parrats and other Birds found us very much
sport. One day with a Pistol-shot I kill'd a great Serpent, which I met with in the way,
and afterwards a Leopard and a Roe-buck: but the Benjans, of whom there were many
in our company, took it very ill at my hands, and reproach'd me with my cruelty, in that
I deprived those Creatures of a life which it was not in my power to give them, and which
God had not bestow'd on them, but that he might be thereby glorified: in so much that
when ever I handled my Pistol, they either express'd their trouble to see me take a pleasure
in violating, in their presence, the Laws of their Religion; or they intreated me, for
their sakes, not to kill them, and when I had made them understand, that I would in any
thing comply with their desires, they, on the other side, had all the kindness imaginable
for me.
               The Country about Lahor is very fertile,Lahor described. and brings forth all sorts of Fruits, as also
Wheat and Rice in abundance, much beyond any other Province of that great Kingdom.
The City is scituated at 32. degrees, 30. minutes elevation, upon the little River Ravy, or
Rav??e, which, with four other Rivers, falls into the Indus, which upon that occasion is called
Pangab, or five-waters, as we have said elsewhere. It is very delightfully seated, especially
towards the River, on which side it hath many fair Gardens. The Kings Palace is within
the City, from which it is divided by a high Wall, and hath many spacious Appartments.
There are also many other Palaces and great Houses, for the reception of those Lords who
ordinarily follow the Court. And in regard most of the Inhabitants are Mahumetans,
there is in this City also a great number of Metzids, or Mosqueys, and bathing places, for
their ordinary Purifications.The Baths of the Mahumetans. I had the curiosity to go into one of their Baths, to observe
their way of bathing. I took along with me my Interpreter, who was by Profession a
Broker, and went into one of their Baths, which was built according to the Persian manner,
with a flat Roof, and had several Partitions, which were made all half round, very
narrow at the entrance, and broad at the bottom, having each of them a door by it self, and
two Receptacles or Tankes of Free-stone, into which the Water was let in by brazen
Cocks, to such height as those who came to bathe themselves desired it. After bathing,
I was ordered to sit down a while, and then I was laid down upon a Stone seven or eight
foot in length, and four in breadth, in which posture the Master of the Bath rubb'd me all
over with a Hair-cloth. He would also have rubb'd the soles of my feet with a handful
of Sand; but perceiving I was not able to endure it, he ask'd me whether I were a Christian,
and having understood that I was, he gave me the Hair-cloath, that I might rub my
feet my self, though he had made no difficulty to rub all the rest of my body. This done,
there came into the Bath a little short Fellow, who laid me all along on the belly upon the
same stone, and rubb'd my back with his hands from the back-bone down to the sides,
telling me, that bathing would do me but little good, if I suffered not the bloud, which
might haply lye corrupted in that place, to be by that rubbing dispersed through all the
other members.
               I found not any thing remarkable about Lahor, but one of the Kings Gardens, which
lies two dayes journey distant from it. I had, as a further diversion in this short piece of
my Travels, this, that in two dayes I rode on four several Creatures: For at first I had a
Mule; then a Camel, then an Elephant, and at last an Oxe, whose troting was the hardest
of any beast that ever I bestrid, lifting up his hoofs as high as the stirrop, and carrying me
between six and seven Leagues in less then four hours. I should have made some longer
stay at Lahor, but receiving Letters from Agra, I was forc'd to come away upon this account,
that the English President intended very suddenly to embark in order to his return for
England, whereupon I put my self into the company of certain Indian Merchants, who
were then upon their return to Amadabath.
               At my coming to Amadabath,Returns to Amadabath. the Director of the English Commerce told me, that he
had received Orders from the President to make as strong a Caffila as he could possibly, and
to come with all expedition to Surat. I there met also with Letters from the President,
whereby I understood, that he only expected the Caffila's of Agra and Amadabath, and

that he would depart as soon as they were come. He writ to me further, that being within
a few dayes after to resign his Presidentship to another, whom his Superiour had appointed
to receive it; and there being to be a great entertainment and feasting at that Ceremony,
he should be glad I were present thereat.
               During my stay at Amadabath,Fire works. the Mahumetans celebrated a Feast, which was concluded
at night with very noble Fire-works. The Windows of all the Houses that stand in
the Meidan were beset with Lamps, before which were placed Vessels of Glass, fill'd with
Waters of several colours, which made a very delightful prospect. Upon the same Meidan,
before the Kings Palace, there are two low Houses, of which there is little use made
but at this Feast, it being the place whither the Sulthan and the Lords of the Court retire
themselves, while fire is set to the Works, which consisted of Squibs, Crackers, and other
ingenious inventions. Some had fasten'd Lamps to certain Wheels, which hung on, though
the Wheels turn'd about perpetually with great violence.
               As soon as the Caffila of Agra was come to Amadabath,Returns to Surat. I took leave of my friends, and
went along with a Caravan of a hundred Waggons.
               The first day we travell'd twelve Cos, or six Leagues, to the City of Mamadabath. The
next day, I went before with the Director of the Commerce at Amadabath, who, with his
Second, was desirous to be present at the Resignation which the President was to make of
his place. We were four in company, and we took along with us four Waggons, two
Horses, and twenty foot Souldiers for our Guard, leaving Order that the Caffila should follow
us with all expedition.
               The foot Souldiers,Persons of quality have Banners carried before them. who carried our Arms and Banners, made a shift nevertheless to
keep pace with us. What I say concerning the Banners, relates to the custom of the Indies,
where there are no persons of any quality but have a Banner, or a kind of Colours,
such as Cornets use, carried before them. That day we cross'd the River Wasser, and took
up our Quarters at night in the Fort of Saselpour. There we met with the Factor of
Brodra, whose name was Mr. Pansfield, who treated us very magnificently the next day at
the place of his residence. We went thence in the evening, and lodg'd the night following
in a great Garden, and the next day we prosecuted our journey. In the evening we
encamped hard by a Tanque, called Sambord; and in regard we had not met with any fair
Water all that day, we endeavour'd to get some out of the Tanque. But the Country people
fearing we might consume all the Water, there coming in at the same time a Dutch Caffila
of two hundred Waggons,An Engagement with the Country people. would not suffer us to come near it. Whereupon we commanded
out fifteen of our foot Souldiers, with express order to bring some Water, if not
by fair means, by force. But coming to the Tanque, they found it guarded by thirty armed
Men, and such as were resolv'd to maintain it, and to hinder any from taking of the Water.
However our Men went very resolutely towards them with their Swords drawn, upon
which, without any dispute at all, the Country people ran away; but while ours were
drawing Water, the Indians shot a certain number of Arrows, and discharg'd three Muskets
among them, and wounded five persons. Ours exasperated at that, kill'd three of the
Country people, whom we saw afterwards carried to the Village.
               While we were at Supper, there came in to us one of the Dutch Merchants, who told us,
that there had been seen two hundred Rasboutes upon our way,An Engagement with the Rasboutes. who had committed several
robberies for some dayes before, and that the very day before they had kill'd six men
within a League of the Village, near which we were then lodg'd. The Dutch Caffila
went away about midnight, and we follow'd it immediately after. But we had not gone
far beyond it, ere we discover'd one of those Holacueurs, who are wont to march in the
head of the Caffilas, and before Troops of Horse, and serve instead of Trumpeters, by
sounding a certain Instrument of Brass, much longer then our ordinary Trumpets. As
soon as he perceiv'd us, he slipp'd into the Wood, where he fell a sounding as loud as ever
he could, which we took for an assured Alarm that it would not be long ere they set upon
us. Accordingly, almost ere we could resolve how to make our party good against them,
we saw coming out of all sides of the Wood, a great number of Rasboutes, arm'd with
short Pikes, Bucklers, Bows and Arrows, but without any Fire-arms. We had the time
to charge those we had, which were four Fire-locks and three pair of Pistols. The Merchant
and I got on horseback, and bestow'd the Fire-locks among those who were in the
Coach, with express order not to fire till they were sure to do execution. Our Fire-arms
were charged with square pieces of Steel, and the Rasboutes came on in so close a body,
that at the first firing we saw three fall. They shot certain Arrows at us, wherewith
they hurt an Oxe and two foot Souldiers. One was shot into the Pommel of my Saddle,
and the English Merchant had another shot into his Turbant. The Dutch Caffila hearing
the noise, commanded out ten Souldiers; but ere they could come in to our relief, we run a

great hazard of our lives. For I was set upon on all sides, and was thrust twice with a
Pike into my Buff-collar, which certainly sav'd my life that day. There came two of the
Rasboutes so near as to lay hold on my bridle, after they had kill'd two of my foot Souldiers,
and were going to carry me away prisoner. But I dispatch'd one of them with a
Pistol-shot, which I gave him in the shoulder, and the English Merchant came in to my relief,
and behav'd himself with as much gallantry as it was possible man could do. The ten
foot Souldiers belonging to the Dutch Caffila being come in, and the Caffila it self not
much behind them, the Rasboutes got into the Wood, leaving six men kill'd upon the place,
and carrying along with them many hurt. On our side we had two foot Souldiers kill'd,
and eight wounded, besides whom, the English Merchant had also received a slight wound.
From that time we kept along with the Caffila, marching in very good order, out of an
imagination we had that the Rasboutes would be sure to set on us a second time: but we
heard no more of them, and came about noon to Broitschia, where we stayed till the evening.
We departed thence about four of the clock that same day, in order to our crossing
the River, and that we might get five Cos further to the Village of Onclasser, where we
lodg'd that night; and the next day, being the 26. of DECEMBER, we got to
Surat.
               At my return to Surat,Comes to Surat. I found in the English Lodge above fifty Merchants, whom the
President had summon'd out of all the other Factories, to give an account of their Administration,
and to be present at the change of Government. This Assembly consisted of
the persons following, viz. Mr. Metwold, the then President, Mr. Fremling, who was to
succeed him in that charge, five Consuls from several places of the Indies, three Ministers,
two Physitians, and twenty five Merchants.
               Being all met together,The English President resigns his charge. the President made an excellent Speech, to give the Assembly
then present his hearty thanks, for the many expressions he had received of their fidelity
and affection during his Government, as also for the honour and respects they had rendred
the East-India Company in his person, and to intreat them to continue the same towards
Mr. Fremling, to whom he had received Order to resign up his charge, exhorting them in
all things to do that which conduced most to the reputation and advantage of the Company.
Having ended his Speech, he delivered Mr. Fremling the Letters Patents, by vertue
whereof he was to assume that new Charge, and made him a short Complement upon that
occasion.
               This Ceremony ended, they went to their Garden without the City, where Mr. Metwold
had prepar'd a magnificent entertainment, consisting of whatever the Country afforded
that was excellent and rare, as also a set of English Musick, Violins, another of Mahumetan,
and a third of Benjan, which for our further divertisement, was accompanied by the
Women-dancers of the Country. All which being over, Order was immediately given,
that those Ships which were fully loaden, should make all necessary Provisions for their
return, and we began to make all things ready for our Voyage.
               December 28. There came to Surat a Sultan,The Sulthan's entrance into Surat. sent thither by the Mogul, to succeed him
whom I had found there at my Arrival. The new President went half a League out of
the City to meet him, accompanied by five of the chiefest Merchants, who intreated me to
go along with them. The Sultan had marching before him several foot Souldiers, and a
certain number of Palanquins, and after them an Elephant, upon which a Man carried a
Banner of red Taffata. After the Elephant came above a hundred foot Souldiers, and
after them twenty other Souldiers, carrying every one a little Banner, much like those of
our Cornets, of several Colours. These march'd immediately before the Sultan, who was
mounted upon a gallant Persian Horse, and attended by several Persons of quality, and a
great number of Men on horseback. On one side of him went a Page with a great Plume
of Feathers, which serv'd for a Fan to keep off the heat of the Sun, and he had carried behind
him his own Palanquin, which was all gilt. His name was Myrsa Mahmuda, one with
whom the new President had been acquainted long before. Having accompanied him to
his Palace, amidst the Acclamations of the people, which throng'd in the Streets to congratulate
his Arrival, he return'd to his own house.
               Immediately upon the establishment of the new President, all the other Officers and
Merchants departed one after another to the places of their ordinary Residence, and the
Ships were ordered to make all things ready to set sail. They were the Mary and the Swan;
but there were to go along with them two other Vessels, one whereof, being too old to get
home into England, was to be sold at Goa, where the President was to touch in his way;
and the other was bound for the same place, to receive fifty thousand Ryals, which the Portuguez
were to pay, in execution of the Treaty of Peace they had made with the English, to
be imployed in the Indies, according as the President of Surat should dispose thereof.
               
                  
The Swan had Orders to set sail ten dayes before us, and to stay for us at the Cape of
good hope. But ere we leave Surat, it will not be amiss to give that account of the Kingdom
of Guzuratta, wherein that famous City of Trade lies, which we promised elsewhere.
               We call it the Kingdom of Guzuaratta,How the Mogul cme to unite the Kingdom of Guzuratta to uCrown in regard it is not above 120. years since the
Mogul united it to his Crown, upon occasion of the King of Guzuratta's minority, who
then reigned. For then Sulthan Mamot, who died about the year 1545. left only one
Son, named Madofher, who being but about eleven or twelve years of age, was put under
the Guardianship of Ehamet-Chan, his Fathers Favourite. This Guardian perceiving, that
his young Master was not in a condition to protect him from the envy of those Grandees,
who had highly express'd their dissatisfaction with his Administration of the Government,
and considering with himself, that he stood in need of a more powerful Protection, made
his Applications to Achobar the Mogul, or King of Indosthan, and intreated him to come
in to the relief of his Ward, promising to deliver up Amadabath, the chief City of the
Kingdom, into his hands. Achobar thought it no prudence to neglect so favourable an
occasion, and so immediately entred Guzuratta with a powerful Army; but instead of contenting
himself with the City of Amadabath, he became absolute Master of the whole
Kingdom, and carried away Madofher and his Guardian Prisoners to Agra. Madofher being
come to thirty years of age, and beginning to reflect on the misfortune of his Captivity,
which he saw must be perpetual, combin'd with one of the most considerable Lords of
Guzuratta, who put him into possession of certain Cities of his Kingdom, such as lay at
the greatest distance from the Frontiers of the Mogul; but they gave him not the time
to settle himself therein. For Achobar immediately sent an Army thither, under the
command of Chan-Channa, who recovered the whole Kingdom in less then a year, prevented
Madofher from making his escape, and took him prisoner. This unfortunate
Prince, reflecting on the Affronts which would be put upon him at his coming to Agra,
and fearing that Achobar would put him to death, chose rather to prevent him, and being
got to a certain place alone, under pretence of doing some necessities of Nature, cut his
own throat.
               The Mogul governs the Kingdom of Guzuratta by a Viceroy,The Governour of Amadabath is Viceroy of all Guzuratta. or Governour General,
who hath his ordinary Residence at Amadabath, in such manner, as that all the other Governours
are oblig'd to give him an account of their Administration, and to receive Orders
from him. His power is in a manner absolute: For, though in the judgment of Civil
Causes, as also when he consults about affairs of Importance, he advises with some of
the principal Lords of the Country, and of his Court; yet can it not be said, that he hath
any settled Council, but takes their Proposals, rather to discover their Sentiments, then to
follow them: Insomuch, that if his imployment were settled for a certain number of
years, he would have no cause to envy the greatness of the Mogul himself. But this Government
depends meerly on the Kings pleasure, who takes occasion often to change the
Governours; as on the other side, they knowing that the least Order from the Court may
dispossess them, let slip no occasion of making their advantages, and??? receiving from all
hands, especially near the time they expect to be recall'd. For then they make it their
business to get excessive sums of money out of the richest Merchants in the Country; especially
those of the City of Amadabath, who are forc'd to clear themselves of false Accusations,
which they had not been charged withall, but to squeeze them of some part of their
Estates, inasmuch as the Governour being supreme Judge of all Causes, as well Civil as Criminal,
they must either expect certain destruction, or satisfie the Governours avarice.
               There is no King in Europe hath so noble a Court as the Governour of Guzuratta,His magnificence. nor
any that appears in publick with greater magnificence. He never comes abroad, but he is
attended by a great number of the Nobility, and his Guards both Horse and Foot, having
marching before him a great many Elephants, with their covering Cloaths of Brocadoe, or
Velvet embroidered, Banners, Drums, Trumpets and Timbrels. In his Palace he is served
as a King, and permits not any to come within his Lodgings, till they have demanded audience.Hath the disoal of all the Revenue of the Kingdom.
He makes his advantages of all the Levies and Impositions which are made in
his Government, so that in a short time he becomes Master of incredible wealth, especially
by means of the third part of all the Arable Lands which belong to the King; and are
assign'd to the Governour for the maintenance of a body of Horse, which he is oblig'd to
defray, but coms much short of the number it should be of.
               The Revenue of the Kingdom of Guzuratta amounted heretofore to eighteen Millions
of Gold,What the Revenue of Gzuratta amounts to. not accounting the Customs of Brodra and Broitschia, which brought in yearly
near eight hundred thousand Crowns. This Country hath no Enemy it need stand
in fer of; but the Mountains of those parts are the retyring places of certain

Radias, or petty Princes, who live only upon rapine, and the incursions their Subjects make
upon the Mogul's Territories, who with all his great power is not able to force them out of
those inaccessible places. Besides these, there are also certain companies of Robbers, or
Tories, who sometimes makes up a body of three or four hundred Men, to rob upon the
High-way, insomuch that travelling cannot be without danger, unless so many travel
together as can in some measure make their party good against the attempts of those
Villains, who are so much the more easily defeated, by reason of their having no fire-Armes.
               The Couteval is he who judges of Affairs of lesser Consequence;The Administration of Iustice. but the administration
of Justice amongst them is very pleasant, in as much as he who complains first most commonly
gets the better of it, so that it may be truly said among them, according to the Proverb,
that who bears away the blows, payes for the bloud-whip. Capital crimes are judged
by the Governours of the several Cities, who cause their Sentences to be put in execution
by the Couteval. There is in a manner no crime, whereof a Man may not avoid the punishment
by Money, so that it may be said of those parts with greater reason then of any
other, that Gibbets are set  only for the unfortunate. The Crimes punished with greatest
severity are, Murther and Adultery, especially when it happens to have been committed
with a Gentlewoman of any Quality. Upon which account it is that they permit Brothel-houses,
all which pay a certain Tribute to the Couteval, who in requital protects
them so well, that it is not only safe, but also honourable for any man to frequent
them.
               We have already given a Catalogue of the principal Cities of Guzuratta,The other Cities of Guzuratta. as Amadabath,
Cambaya, Surat, Brodra, Broitschia, &c. All which we passed through in our Travels, so that
it remains only, that we give a short account of the other more inconsiderable places of the
Kingdom.
               GogaGoga. is a small City, or rather a great Village, thirty Leagues distant from Cambay, at a
place where the Gulf is so narrow, that it seems to be a kind of a River. This place is
sufficiently well peopled, and most of the Inhabitants are Benjans, and live either by their
Relation to the Sea, or by Weaving. It hath neither Gates nor Bulwarks, but only a Freestone
Wall towards the Sea-side, where the Portuguez Frigats have their Rendezvous, in
order to the conveying of their Merchant-men to Goa.
               Pattepatane and Mangerol,Pattepatane and Mangerol. are two great Towns, nine Leagues distant from Goga, and
there are made in them great quantities of Cottons and Linnen-cloath.
               The City of Diu,Diu. where the Portuguez have three strong Castles, is seated upon the
Frontiers of the Kingdom, on the South-side. They call it Diu??, pronouncing thee so
gently, that a man can hardly hear it. The word Diu?? signifies an Island, and thence comes
the word, Agrediu??, five Isles, and that of Nalediu??, four Isles, which the Portuguez corruptly
call Maldiua; and Diu??, Noulaka, the Isle of fourscore and ten thousand, which
hath that name given it, upon this account, that the Daughter of a certain Lord of the
said place, having begg'd of her Father the Revenue of it for one day, it brought her in
fourscore and ten thousand pieces of Silver.
               The City of BisantaganBisantagan. is one of the greatest of all the Kingdom of Guzuratta, as containing
near twenty thousand Houses. It lies almost in the midst of the Kingdom, and
till of late was but a simple Village. The fertility of the adjacent Country hath raised
it to the greatness wherein it now is; for thereabouts they keep abundance of Cattle, and
there grow also great quantities of Rice, Wheat and Cotton, which is made into Yarn and
Clothes.
               The City of PettanPettan. was heretofore six Leagues about, and encompassed with a strong
Wall of Free-stone, which is now broken down in several places, since its Commerce began
to diminish. The Inhabitants are for the most part Benjans, and their Profession, making
of Stuffs of Silk for the wearing of the Country, as also some Cotton-cloaths, but they are
very course, and are of those kinds which are commonly called Dosternals, Sgarderberal,
Longis, Allegiens, &c. This City hath a fair Castle within it, where the Sulthan of the
place lives. In the middest of the City there is a Mosquey, which was built by the Pagans???
and may pass for one of the most sumptuous Temples in all the East. Its Roof is sustain'd
by a thousand and fifty Pillars, most whereof are of Marble. Those who have contributed
most to the destruction of that Cities Trading, are a sort of People called the Coulses,
who having taken any of the Inhabitants abroad in the Country, force them to ransome
themselves, and do so pester the High-wayes, that the Merchants dare not travel that
way.
               CheytepourCheytepour. lies six Leagues from Pettan, and twenty two from Amadabath, upon a small
Rivers side. All the Inhabitants are Benjans, who are Weavers, and make great quantities

of Cottn-yarn. There is in the City a Garrison of 150. men, for the securing of the
Caffilas, which pass that way for Agra and Amadabath.
               MessanaMessana. is an open Town, having within it an old ruin'd Castle, the Governour whereof
is oblig'd to maintain two hundred Horse, for the safe passage of the Caffilas. The Country
all about produces much Cotton, and some Cloaths are made there, but no great quantities.
               Nassary, or Nausary, Gaudui, and Balsara,Nassary, Gaudui, and Balsara. are three small Cities, under the jurisdiction of
Surat, from which the first is six, the second nine, and the third fourteen Leagues distant.
They lye all three about two Leagues distant from the Sea. There are made in them
great quantities of course Cottons; and it is in these parts that they ell the Wood, which
is spent all over the Kingdom in the building of Houses and Ships.
               The old Inhabitants of the Country are Pagans,The Inhabitants of Guzuratta and are those whom they properly
call Hindoy, or Indou. The Mahumetans Religion came in with the Arms of Tamerlan,
and those other Forreigners, who have settled themselves there, by the Conquests they
have in those parts. The Kingdom is peopled with Persians, Arabians, Armenians, and
several other Nations; but you shall seldome meet there with either Chineses or Iaponeses;
for they are so warm and well provided at home, that they seldome settle themselves
elsewhere.
               The Mahumetans of the Country, professing, at least by name, the same Religion with
the Persians, occasions the Persian Language to be as common among them as the Indosthan,
though in the Explication of the Alchoran, they follow the sentiments of Hembili,
and Maleki, whereas the Persians accept only of the Exposition of Aly and Tzafersaduck;
but they both condemn that of Hanifa, which is approved by the Turks.
               It is not our design in this place to run into any discourse of the Mahumetan Religion;
but, having premised a short account of the Inhabitants of the Country, we shall afterwards
treat more at large of their Religion, and the Sects whereof it consists. They are
all of an Olive or Duskish colour, but more or less such, according to the Climate in which
they live. Those who are more towards the South, are without comparison of a much
higher colour, then those who live more towards the North. The Men are strong, and
well proportioned, having large Faces and black Eyes, and cause their Heads and Beards to
be shaven clear off, excepting only the Mustachoes, as the Persians do also. The Mahumetans
cloath themselves much after the Persian Mode, only they fold their Turbants after
another way. There is also this difference observ'd between them, that the Indosthans
have the opening of their Garments under the left Arm,Their Cloaths. whereas the Persians have it under
the right Arm; and that the former tye their Girdles before, and let the ends hang down,
whereas the Persians do only fold it several times about the body, and hide the ends within
the Girdle it self. It is within these Girdles that they carry their Ponyards, which they
call Limber, and are about a foot long, having the Blade much broader towards the Handle
then it is towards the Point. There are some have Swords of that making, but the Souldiers
commonly wear Cymitars. Good Horses are very scarce in those parts, whence it
comes that they often make use of Oxen, which are altogether as swift as our Horses, and
I have seen whole Troops consisting of this kind of Cavalry.Their Women. The Women are very well
proportioned, though of low stature. They have very handsom bodies, and are very sumptuous
in their Attire. Their Hair hangs down over their Shoulders, and on their Heads they
have only a thin Cap, or cover them with a Crepine of Lawn, wrought with Gold, the ends
whereof hang down on both sides as low as their Knees. Those who are of ability wear in
their Ears Pendants of Diamonds, Pearls, or other precious Stones, and about their Necks
Neck-laces of a kind of great round Pearl, which makes no undelightful show on the
brown complexion of the Ladies of those parts, who sometimes also wear Rings in their
Nostrils, which is so much the less incommodious to them, in that they never almost have
any occasion to wipe their Noses. They wear Breeches as well as the Men, which are of
Taffata, or some kind of Cotton-stuffe; and those of such length, that were they let out,
they would reach over their Heads. They lye close and even till they come down below
the Ham, where they are folded like Mens Boots into many folds, in regard there is a String
of Silver and Silk runs through them, wherewith they are ty'd and fastned above the Navil,
the ends of which String hang down to their Feet. These Drawers, or Breeches, they
wear under their Smocks, which are so short, that they reach not much below their Waste;
and upon the Breeches they wear a Petticoat of Taffata, or Cotton, but so thin, that its
easie to see all under it. Their Shooes are commonly of red Cordovant, or Spanish
Leather, flat-sold, and narrow towards the Toe. They go bare-breasted, and bare-arm'd
up to the Elbows, save that much of those parts is hid by the many Bracelets
which they wear about them. Those Women, who stand upon their Honour, appear not

in publick with their Faces uncovered; nay those of any quality are very seldome permitted
to come abroad. But the Benjan Women are clad quite after another manner.
               There is no Province in the India, where there are not some Benjans; but in Guzuratta
they are more numerous then in any other place, and they are distinguish'd from the Mahumetans
by their habit. They do not shave their Heads, yet do they not wear their Hair
very long. They have every day a yellow Mark made in their Foreheads, of about a fingers
breadth, which is made with Water and Sandal-wood, in which they beat four or five
grains of Rice. They are their Bramans who give them that Mark after they have done
their Devotions before the Pagodes. The Women do not cover their Faces, as those of
the Mahumetans do; yet do they not make any difficulty to adorn themselves with Pendants
and Neck-laces, especially their Ears, which they in a manner cover with Pearls.
The blacker their Teeth are,Black Teeth beautiful. the greater beauty they think it. During my stay at Amadabath,
some of the Women there told me, that it was an ugly thing to have white Teeth,
as Dogs and Monkeys have; and thence it came that they called us Bondra, that is, Apes.
They wear no Breeches, but only a piece of thin Silk-stuff, which they call Cabay, and
reaches down to their Hams,The Cloath of the Benjan women. and upon that they put their Smocks, and on them their upper
Garment, which they tye with a String at the Waste. Some among them wear a kind of
narrow Wastcoats, the Sleeves whereof reach but to the Elbow, being naked down from
the Breasts to the Navil. In Summer they wear wooden Shooes, which they fasten to their
Feet with Straps; but in Winter, their Shooes are of Velvet of several colours, or of Brocadoe,
cover'd with gilt Leather. The quarters of their Shooes are very low, for this
reason, that as well Men as Women put them off, when they go into any Room, the Floor
thereof being covered with Tapistry. Children go naked, till they come to about four or
five years of Age, the Girles as well as the Boyes. The Men are very civilly apparell'd,
and live without any scandal among the Mahumetans, who being imperious and insolent,
treat the Benjans, as if they were their slaves, with great contempt, much after the manner
the Iews are treated in Europe, in those places where they are permitted to live. Which yet
hinders not but that the Benjans are as ingenious as the Mahumetans,The Benjans are ingenious. and, without comparison,
more subtle, and more civil, then any of the other Indians. There are not any of
them can write and cast account better then they, nor any whose conversation is more delightful
then theirs: but they come short of that sincerity which the others have, so that
a Man must be very cautious how he hath to do with them, in as much as there is no Commodity
which they do not adulterate; and they never drive any bargain, but they endeavour
to surprize and circumvent those they are to deal with. The Dutch and English
know this by experience; whence it comes, that they make use of these people, as their
Brokers and Interpreters, that they may discover the Impostures and cheats of others.
There is no Trade which they apply not themselves to; and there is no Commodity but
they sell it, unless it be Flesh, Fish, or any other thing that hath had life. Their children
are oblig'd to match among those of the same Trade or Profession as the Father had
been of; and they suffer not those who do otherwise, to be of the same Caste, or Family:
but they may be the beginners of a new Trade, and yet continue in the same
Religion.
               They marry their Children at seven, eight, nine, or ten years of Age, and it very seldome
happens that they stay till twelve, especially if they be Daughters: for, if they
stay till that time, they are look'd on as stale Maids, it being their perswasion, that
there must be some imperfection, either in the Maids person, or those of her Parents,
if there be not some Addresses made to her before that time; in which particular they
think themselves so much concern'd, that they make it a punctilio of Honour and
Conscience.
               The Wedding-day being come,Their Ceremonies of marriage. the Parents of the betrothed parties sit down in a Hall,
about a good Fire, and cause the Bridegroom and the Bride to take three turns about it,
during which, the Braman pronounces certain words, which serve for a Benediction of
the Marriage. This Custom they the more punctually observe, in regard, that, if the
Bridegroom should chance to dye before he had taken his three turns about the Fire, the
Bride might take a second Husband, which the Benjan Widows are not permitted to do,
even though the Bridegroom died before the consummation of the Marriage, but she is
obliged to suffer all her Ornaments to be taken away from her, and her Hair to be cut off.
They are not forc'd to burn themselves with the dead bodies of their Husbands, as the
Wives of the Bramans or Rasbotes are, neither are they hindred to do it, if they have an
inclination thereto. Those Widows, who cannot brook a single life, get in among the
publick Dancers of that Sex; which must needs happen very frequently in a Climate, which
derives to the Bodies living in it no great disposition to Chastity.
               
                  
The Benjan Law permits men, not only to marry a second or third time, in case of death,
but also to wed a second or third Wife,The men permitted to marry twice or thrice. if the first and second proves barren; the first retaining
nevertheless a certain preheminence, as being Mother of the Family. The Sons are
Heirs of all their Fathers Estate, but with this provision, that they are to maintain the Mother,
and marry the Sisters.
               The Benjans are Pagans,The Religion of the Benjans. as having among them neither Baptisme nor Circumcision. They
are indeed of a belief, That there is but one God, Creator and Preserver of the Universe;
yet does not this perswasion hinder, but that they worship the Devil, and give for their
reason,They worship the Devil. that God created him to govern the World, and to do mischief to Mankind.
Whence it comes, that all their Mosqueys are fill'd with representations of him, in Statues
of Gold, Silver, Ivory, Ebony, Marble, Wood, and ordinary Stone. The Figure under
which they represent him is dreadful to look on. The Head, out of which grows four
Horns, is adorn'd with a triple Crown, after the fashion of a Tiara. The countenance is
horridly deformed, having coming out of the Mouth two great Teeth, like the Tusks of a
Boar, and the Chin set out with a great ugly Beard. The Breasts beat against the Belly,
at which the Hands are not absolutely joyned together, but seem negligently to hang
down. Under the Navil, between the two Thighs, there comes out of the Belly another
Head, much more ghastly then the former, having two Horns upon it, and thrusting out of
the Mouth a filthy Tongue of extraordinary bigness. Instead of Feet it hath Paws, and
behind, a Cows-tail: This Figure is placed on a Table of Stone, which serves for an Altar,
and receives the Offerings which are made to the Pagode. On the right side of the
Altar there stands a Trough, in which those who intend to do their Devotions wash
and purifie themselves; and on the other side, there is a Box; or Chest, for reception or the
Offerings, which are made in Money; and near the Trough there is placed, within the
wall of a Vessel, out of which the Bramans take the yellow stuffe, wherewith they mark
the foreheads of those who have said their Prayers. The Braman, or Priest, belonging
to the place, sits at the foot of the Altar, whence he rises at certain times to say his Prayers;
and when he goes away, he concludes his Devotions with that kind of purifying, which
is performed by rubbing his hands in the flame of the Lamps, which stand before and above
the Altar, as we have described it elsewhere.
               Nor is it only in great Cities that the Benjans have their many Msqueys,Their Mosqueys. but they have
them also up and down the Country, upon the High-wayes, and in the Mountains and
Woods. They have no other light then what they have from the Lamps, which are kept
perpetually burning in them; having no other Ornament, then that the Walls are bedabed
with the Figures of Beasts and Devils, and look more like Caves, and the Recesses
of unclean Spirits, which they are in effect, then places design'd for the exercise of Religion.
Yet it is certain nevertheless, that these poor ignorant people express as much Devotion
for these Monsters, as the most regenerate Christians can do for their God, and the
most sacred Mysteries of their Religion; though they at the same time acknowledge, that
it is not a Divinity they adore, but a Creature which hath some power derived from God,
and is able to do good and ill to Men.
               They have this common with the Mahumetans,Their Purification. that they make the principal part of
Religion to consist in corporeal Purifications. Whence it comes, that there psses not a
day but they wash themselves, and many of them do it very betimes in the morning, before
Sun-rising, going into the Water up to the waste, and holding in their hand a Straw, which
the Braman gives them, to chase away the evil Spirit, while the Braman blesses and makes
exhortations to those who purifie themselves in that manner.
               These Bramans,Their God Brama. or Bramanes, make it their boast, that they came out of the Head of their
God Brama, of whom, they say, there were many other Productions, which came but out of
his Arms, Thighs, Feet, and other more ignoble parts of his Body??? but they have this advantage,
that they have their being from the Brains of that great God.
               Abraham Rogers, who lived ten years upon the Coasts of Coromandel, upon the service of
the Hollanders, in an Employment, by means whereof he might make more certain Discoveries
of the Religion of these people,Their opininion concerning the Creation of the World. relates, in the Treatise he hath written of Paganisme,
that the Bramanes affirm, that their great God, whom they sometimes call Wistul, sometimes
Etwara, and who, they say, is the greatest, and the God of all the Gods, bethinking
himself, before the Creation of the World, when there was in the Universe but one God
and Water, meerly for his Diversion sake, to make a World, had assumed the Figure of a
little Child, and having cast himself upon a Leaf, which he had found swimming upon the
Water, and playing Childishly with his great Toe in his mouth, there came out of his Navel
a Flower, which they call Tamara, of which Flower was produced the first of all Men,
whom they call Brama.
               
                  
That the first thing which Brama did, was to give God thanks that he had bestow'd on
him a rational Soul, and that God was so well pleased with that acknowledgment of his,
that he gave him power, not only to create the World, and whatsoever is contained therein,
but also to take upon him the Government thereof, which God was willing not to be
troubled withall himself: So that Brama, being as it were Gods Vicegerent and Deputy,
in this vast and infinite Administration, there happens not any good or evil to men but by
his means, since it is he who hath limited the life of Man to a hundred years, and hath decreed
and appointed the prosperity and adversity that shall befal him.
               To this they add; that Brama had five Heads, and that, one day, rebelling against the
God Wistu, He commanded one of his Servants, named Bierewa, to cut off the Head which
stood in the midst, with his Nail: But that Brama having humbled himself before God,
and having made Verses in praise of him, Wistu was so highly pleas'd to hear them sung,
that he told Brama, it troubled him much, that he had ordered one of his five Heads to be
cut off; but however, bid him be of good comfort, forasmuch as he should have the
same power with the other four, as he had before. And yet they have this belief withall,
that this imprudence of Brama will hinder him from enjoying, in the other World,
that measure of Glory which he might have hoped, had he continu'd in his original Integrity.
               They affirm,Brama's Lieutenants that Brama governs the World by many Lieutenants, the chiefest of whom
is he whom they call Derwendre, who commands all those who govern the eight Worlds,
which are like this we inhabit, and go to the Composition of the Universe, whereof, according
to them, there are seven other parts like ours, all which swim upon the water, like
so many Eggs. They believe also, that the World, which is now extant and in being, is
not any effect of the first Creation, but that there have been many before it, and that there
will be others after it. That that wherein we now live is to continue yet a Million of
Ages longer, since that in the year MDCXXXIX. there were but four thousand seven
hundred thirty nine years of the fourth Age of the World expired, and that the first bad
lasted a hundred and seven thousand two hundred and ninety Ages: That in the said first
Age of the World all Men were good and just, so as that the Devil, who was created even
in that time, had no power to do them any mischief: That in the following Age, the fourth
part of Mankind became depraved; and that in the third, good and bad were equally
divided; but that in these last times, the World was so much corrupted, that the number
of the just was reduc'd to the fourth part.
               But it is besides the Design of our Relation to digress into the Theology of these people;
whereof the Author we cited before hath written a Treatise, sufficient to satisfie the
curiosity of the most Learned.
               We shall therefore only say,The Authority of the Bramanes. that these Bramanes are very highly respected among the
other Pagans; not only upon the account of their austerity of life, and their extraordinary
abstinence; (for there are some of them fast three or four dayes together, not eating any
thing at all;) but also in regard, that besides their Superintendency in matter of Religion,
they have the oversight of Schools, where they teach Children to read and write.
They expound the Mysteries of their Religion to the ignorant, and by that means make
what impressions they please in the minds of superstitious people, in as much as they give
what Interpretation they fancy themselves, to the Auguries and other vanities, about
which they are perpetually consulted. They are believed as so many Oracles; aad thence
it comes, that the Benjans seldom engage themselves in any business of consequence, without
the advice and encouragement of the Braman. They are distinguish'd from the other
Benjans, only by what they wear upon their heads, which is a Coiffure made of white Linnen-cloath,
and comes several times about the Head, to cover their Hair, which they never
cut; as also by three pieces of small Packthread, which they wear next their Skins, and
come cross the Breast, from the Shoulder to the Waste, which Packthread they never put
off, nor would, though it were to save their lives. They heighten and improve the popular
superstition, by the Relations they make of thousands of false Miracles, done by their
Pagodes and Saints, whom they perswade people to worship, as Intercessors with God for
them.
               They hold the Immortality of the Soul,Tey believe the immortality and transmigration of . but believe withall, that, at its departure out of
the first Body, it transmigrates into that of some other Creature; and affirm, that the Soul
of a good natur'd and docible person, is translated into the body of a Pidgeon, or Chicken;
that of a cruel and wicked man, into that of a Crocodile, a Lyon, or a Tiger; that of a
crafty man, into that of a Fox; that of a Glutton, into the body of a Swine; that of a
treacherous person, into that of a Serpent, &c. before they are admitted to the enjoyment
of a beatitude purely Spiritual. And this is the only reason, why the Benjans abstain from

the killing of living Creatures, even to the Insects, how dangerous or troublesome soever
they may be. They also forbear keeping any Fire, and lighting Candles in the night time,
out of a fear that the Flies or Moths should burn themselves therein; nay, they make
some difficulty to make pits on the Ground, for fear of drowning the Fleas and other Insects,
which might lie in the way. What is yet more superstitious, they do not only redeem
the Birds, which the Mahumetans had taken, but they also built Hospitals for Beasts
that are hurt and wounded.
               The Bramanes are very much respected all over the Indies,A strange imployment of the Bramans among the Malabares. but more then any where
else, among the Malabares, where they have a very odd kind of Employment. For there
is no marriage contracted among them, but the first Fruits of the Bride are consecrated to
the Braman, to whom she is brought to be deflour'd. They believe that the marriage were
not sufficiently bless'd, if the Braman have not the first trial of the Bride; whence it
comes, that many times he is earnestly intreated before he does it; and if the persons be of
any quality, he hath a reward given him, as if he had been hired to do the work. When
the Men are to go any journey, they intreat the Braman to have a care of their Wives
while they are away, and to supply their places till they return.
               The Benjans are divided among themselves,The Sects of the Benjans. into fourscore and three principal Sects; not
accounting the other less considerable ones, which are multiply'd almost to infinity, in regard
there is hardly any Family, but hath its particular Superstitions and Ceremonies. The four
principal Sects, which comprehend all the rest, are those of Ceurawath, Samarath, Bisnow,
and Go??ghy. Those of Ceurawath are so punctual in the preservation of living Creatures
and Insects, that their Bramanes have their mouths cover'd with a piece of linnen-cloath,
for fear any Fly should get into it, and in their Houses they have alwayes a little Broom in
their hands, to sweep the Room, least they should negligently tread upon any Insect; and
they will not sit, till they have first made clean the seat or place where they are to sit down.
They go bare-headed and bare-foot, with a white Staffe in their hands, by which they are
distinguish'd from the others. They keep no fire in their Houses, nor light any Candles in
them. They never drink any cold water, for fear of meeting with any Insect in it, but
they have it boil'd at some ones house of their Sect.Their Cloathing. They have no other cloathing then
a piece of course Linnen-cloath, which hangs down from the Navel to the Knees, and cover
not the rest of their body, but with a small piece of Woollen-cloath, as much as could be
made of one Fleece of Wooll.
               The Opinions they have of God are in some things different from those of the other
Benjans,Their Belief. inasmuch as they do not attribute to him an infinite being, which disposeth of the
events of things, but they would have them to depend absolutely on good and ill fortune.
They have a Saint named Tiel Tencker, and acknowledge no other good works then Fasting
and Alms deeds: They believe that the Sun, the Moon, and other Stars, the Earth, living
Creatures, Trees, Metals, and in a word, all things visible, have in themselves the first causes
of their production and motion. They hold, that there are two Suns, and as many Moons,
which relieve one the other alternately every day. They believe nothing of Heaven or
Paradise, and yet acknowledge the immortality of the Soul, but after a very extraordinary
manner. For they affirm, that the Soul, at its departure out of the body it had first animated,
enters into another, either of Man or Beast, according to the good or ill life of the
deceased: but that it ever makes choice of the Female, that it may return again into the
world, to live there in another body.
               Their Mosqueys,Their Mosqueys. which they call Rales, are built four square with flat roofs, and towards
the East-side there is an open place, under which are the Chappels of their Pagodes, built
after a pyramidal form, and rais'd ten foot from the ground, having upon the stairs leading
up to them, several Figures of Wood, Stone, and Paper, representing their deceased Kindred,
whose lives had been remarkable for some extraordinary good fortune. They do their
greatest Devotions in the moneth of August, during which, they mortifie themselves by so
great abstinencies, as might pass elsewhere for no less then miraculous; it being certain,
that there are some,Their extraordinary bstinences. who for the space of fifteen dayes, or three weeks, nay sometimes a
moneth or six weeks, live without taking any thing but water, into which they put the
scrapings or thavings of a certain bitter Wood, which is conceived to have somewhat of
nourishment in it. I must confess this will not easily be credited; but it is so acknowledged
a Truth in the Indies, that it is not disputed by their greatest Enemies. They have also
about that time many Assemblies in their Mosqueys, where their discourse is concerning the
lives of their departed Saints, and there are read certain Legends, the people standing about
the Braman, who sits down in the midst of them, having his mouth cover'd with a Linnen-cloath.
               As they go into the Mosquey,Their publick Assemblies. they bestow their Charities, casting them into a great

Copper basin, which they place before the Pagode, and in requital, they receive a mark with
the Sandal-wood, which is made in their Foreheads, or upon their Clothes. While they
are discoursing about their Saints, which lasts for the most part four or five hours, they are
entertain'd with Musick, which is paid for out of the Charities that had been collected
among them for the poor. They burn the bodies of aged persons, but bury those of Children
who dye under three years of age. Their Widows are not obliged to burn themselves
with their departed Husbands, but they promise perpetual Widowhood. All that
make profession of this Sect may be admitted to Priesthood. Nay, Women are receiv'd
into that Function, provided they be above twenty years of age; but the Men are admitted
into it, at seven, eight and nine years of age. To become Priests, all they have to do,
is to put on the habit, to accustom themselves to the austerity of that kind of life, and to
make a vow of Chastity. Any one of the married couple hath the priviledge to become
a Priest, and by that means, to oblige the other to celibate, for the remainder of his or her
life. There are some make a Vow of Chastity in the state of marriage; but this is seldom
seen, and when it is, those who make such Vows, are not overstrict in the observance of
them.
               All the other Castes, or Sects of the Benjanes, have an aversion and contempt for this,
and condemn it so much, that their Doctors continually exhort their Auditours to shun the
Conversation of those people; so that they will not only not eat or drink with them, but
they would not so much as set a foot in their Houses, though it were to avoid an imminent
and inevitable danger; and such as are so unhappy as to touch them, are obliged to do a
publick and severe pennance.
               The second Sect of the Benjans,The Sect of Samarath. called Samarath, hath this common with the former,
that it permits not the killing of any Creature or Insect that hath life, nor the eating of
any thing that hath had it. This Sect consists of Lock-makers, Smiths, Farriers, Carpenters,
Taylors, Shooe-makers, Furbishers, and all other Tradesmen, admitting among them,
even Souldiers,Their belief. Clerks, and other Officers. Their Religion is different from that of the
former, in that they believe, that this World was created by a first cause, which governs and
preserves all, with a soveraign and unchangeable power.
               They call him in their Language Permiseer,Their God and his Substitutes. and assign him three Substitutes, who have
their several Functions under his Superintendency. The first, who is called Brama, hath
the disposal of all Souls, which he sends into such Bodies as Permiseer appoints, either of
Men or Beasts. The second, whom they call Buffiuna, teaches the World to live according
to Gods Commandments, which they have disposed into four Books. He hath also the
oversight of Provisions, and advances the growth of Wheat, Herbs and Pulse, after Brama
hath endued them with Souls. The third, named Mais, exercises his power over the dead.
He is also Secretary to Permiseer, and takes the good and bad works of the deceased into
examination, that he may make a report thereof to his Master, who having examin'd both
the one and the other, sends the Soul into a Body, where she doth more or less pennance,
proportionably to the good or ill she hath done in the former. Those that are sent into
the body of a Cow, are accounted the most happy, in regard that that Beast having something
Divine in it, according to their opinion, they hope in a short time to be purified of
the sins which they had committed during their continuance in the former body. But
those which are forc'd to take up their second habitations in the bodies of Elephants, Camels,
wild Oxen, Goats, Asses, Leopards, Swine, Serpents, or any other unclean Beast, are on
the contrary thought most unhappy, inasmuch as at their departure out of them, they
pass into the bodies of other Beasts, either tame, or less wild, where they compleat the
expiation of the Crimes for which they were condemned to those punishments. The same
thing happens also to those souls which are in the bodies of some Creatures that dye
before they have compleated their Purification; which being absolutely consummated,
Mais presents the Souls so purified to Permiseer, who receives them into the number of his
Servants.
               They burn the bodies of the deceasd,A particular Ceremony about the dead save only those of Children under three years of
age; but they have this particular Ceremony, that these Obsequies are performed on the
side of a River or Brook, whither they carry the sick persons, when they are past hopes
of recovery, that they may expire there.
               There is no Sect,The Women burn themselves at their Husbands death. The reason of it. in which the Women sacrifice themselves so cheerfully to the memory
of their Husbands, as in this Sect of Samarath. For they are perswaded, that the promise
which Buffiuna makes them, in the Law he gave them from Permiseer, is infallible; to wit,
that if a Woman hath so great an affection for her Husband, as to burn her self with him
after his death, she shall live with him in the other World seven times as long, and shall enjoy
him with seven times as much satisfaction as she had done in this: which hope makes

them look on death, but as a passage, through which they are to enter into a beatitude and
bliss, whereof they had in this world but a small earnest.
               As soon as the Women are delivered, there is presented to the new born Child, an Inkhorn,
Paper and Pens, and if it be a Boy, they add a Bow and Arrows; to signifie that
Buffiuha will write his Law in his understanding, and that one day he shall raise his Fortunes
by the Wars. For as we said before, this Sect admits of Souldiers: but those among
them, whose Profession it is to bear Arms, make a distinct Sect, which they call that of the
Rasboutes, of whom we shall give an account anon.
               Those of the Sect of Bisnow have this common with the two precedent,The Sect of Bisnow. that they abstain
from feeding on any thing that hath had life. They fast also, and in the moneth of
August have their Assemblies in their Agoges; so they call their Mosqueys. Their principal
Devotion consists in singing of Hymns to the honour of their God,Their God. whom they call Ram-ram,
and pray, to bless them and their Families with a supply of what they think necessary,
that they may live without discontent and inconvenience. Their singing is accompany'd
with dancing, and Musick, consisting of Drums, Pipes, Copper-basins, and other Instruments,
upon which they play before their Idols. They represent their Ram-ram, with his
Wife, in several manners, and adorn both their Statues on Holy-dayes, with many Gold
Chains, Collars of Pearl, and all sorts of precious Stones, and set up many Lamps, and Wax-candles
before them. This God hath no Substitutes, as that of the Sect of Samarath, but
doth all himself.
               The ordinary sustenance of the Bisnow is only Herbs and Pulse, fresh Butter, Milk and
Curds.Their manner of life. They are great lovers of the Atschia, which is a certain Composition made of
Ginger, Mangas, Citrons, Garlick, and Mustard-seed pickled with Salt, and drink only Water,
or Baratte. They are either Women or Priests that dress their meat; and instead of
Wood, which they forbear burning, because there are sometimes Worms in it, which might
by that means be destroyed,Their iring they use Cow-dung dried in the Sun, and mixt with Straw,
which they cut in square pieces, as they do the Turfs in Holland, and so expose it to
sale.
               Those of this Sect are for the most part addicted to Merchandise, either upon their own
account, or as Agents and Factors under others. They understand the business of Commerce
extreamly well, and their Conversation is not unpleasant; whence it comes that
both Christians and Mahumetans employ them as Brokers and Interpreters, in their way of
Trading.
               They have this particular Custom in this Sect,Their Wives are not burnt. that they permit not the Women to burn
themselves with their Husbands; but they oblige them to perpetual widowhood, even
though the Husband died before the consummation of the marriage. It is not long since,
that among them, the younger Brother was oblig'd to marry his elder Brothers Widow, to
raise up seed to him; but this custome is abolish'd by an express Law which condemns the
Women to celibate.
               In the morning they all wash themselves in a Tanque, or rather in a River, if there be any
near the place where they live, and they think it not enough to go into it up to the Waste,
but they tumble, wallow, and swim in it, muttering certain words between their Teeth,
while the Braman, who sits on the River-side and looks to their Cloaths, gives them his
Benediction, and prayes God that they may be as clean from their sins, as their bodies are
clear of filth. At their coming out of the water he rubs their Foreheads, Noses and Ears,
with a certain Composition made of Sandal, or some other Odoriferous wood, and they
give him for his pains a small quantity of Wheat, Rice or Pulse.
               Those of the Sect of G??ghy intermeddle not with either Trade or Traffick,The Sect of the Go??ghy. but live a
very solitary life, in the Country, in obscure Villages, or the ruines of Houses, where they
worship their God Bruin, and his Servant Mecis. They have neither Mosqueys, nor any
other publick places,Their God. wherein to assemble to do their Devotions; nay will not go into the
Mosqueys of the other Benjans, unless it be into those of the Sect of Samarath; but it is
only to take up their Lodging in them for want of other accommodation. For they are
forbidden by their Law to be proprietors of any thing. They shun the conversation of
Men, and live in Woods and Desarts, like the Hermits and ancient Achorites. They have
nothing about them, but a piece of Linnen-cloath, to cover that part which Nature is
unwilling should be expos'd to the view of all. They rub their Bodies all over with
Ashes, and when-ever they sit down, they have a little heap of Ashes near them, which they
are perpetually handing, and scatter of it upon their moist Hair, which disfigures them
after a strange manner. They never speak to such as pass by them, nor give them
the time of the day; nay, they will not answer those that speak to them, out of this perswasion,
that being consecrated to their God Bruin, they believe they should defile themselves

by speaking to other men. Whence it happens, that when they come into any City,
they make no stay therein, and will not turn out of that Street which leads them to the
Gate they would go out at. Wherein they are so scrupulous, that they will not ask for
any thing, though they were ready to starve. They will indeed receive what is give
them, but if there be nought given them they live on Herbs and Roots, which they find
in the fields. There are some among them that have three or four servants, who put
themselves voluntarily into their service, that they may participate of their sanctity: but
all the service they do them is what they list themselves. For the Masters never command
them to do any thing, nay not what is most necessary to life. All the other Benjans have
a certain veneration for the Go??ghys, except it be those of the Caste, or Sect of Ceurawath,
who have a horrour for them, and shun their conversation.
               There are some among them have a greater reputation of knowledge and sanctity then
others, but they make no advantage thereof, in as much as their condition is equal. They
never marry, but live in so great observance of Chastity, that they would not suffer a
Woman to touch them. The common people hath a great devotion for these Go??ghys,
saluting them with much respect, and receiving their Benediction with great submission.
               The Go??ghys believe,Their belief. that their God Bruin hath created all things, and that he continues
them in being, by his infinite power, by which he is able to destroy and reduce them to nothing.
               They affirm, that he is not to be represented by any Figure of either Man or Beast, but
that he is a light, which cannot be the Object of our sight, inasmuch as, having created that
of the Sun, it is not to be admired, that we cannot contemplate the principle of so transcendent
a brightness.
               They believe not the Transmigration of Souls,Hold not the transmigration of Souls. as the other Benjans do; but affirm, that
the Souls at their departure out of the body, are immediately transferred to their God
Bruin, to live with him eternally, and to be united to that infinite Light.
               Certain it is, that Charcoal-men and Chimney-sweepers among us are not so besmutted
as these people, who take a pleasure in disfiguring their bodies and countenances, not only
by the Ashes wherewith they continually rub them, but also by their abstinences, which as
they are greater, so are they withall much more frequent then those of the Benjans of the
Sect of Ceurawath. There are some Women become Go??ghys, but in regard that Sex is
too tender and delicate, to accustom themselves to so great austerity, their number is not
very great.
               The Benjans oblige their Proselytes,A strange manner of living. that is, the Mahumetans, who embrace their Religion,
to a very extravagant manner of life. For, to renew their whole body, which, according
to their Opinion, is defiled by the flesh they had eaten, they oblige them for the
space of six moneths together, to mix amongst what they are to eat, a pound of Cow-dung;
out of this reason, that that Creature having, as they hold, some thing divine in it, here is
nothing can purifie the body so well as that kind of nourishment, which their Proselytes
are permitted to diminish by degrees, after the three first moneths of their conversion. They
also condemn to that kind of Diet, those of their own Sect, who having been prisoners
among the Mahumetans, or Christians, or conversing ordinarily among them, have been
perswaded to eat flesh, or drink wine; and receive them not into their communication, till
such time as they have been purified in that manner.
               All the Benjans are extreamly superstitious.The superstition of the Benjans. For they never go out of their houses, till
they have said their Prayers; and if at their going out they meet with any ill presage,
they return into their houses, and do not any business of importance that day. They take
to presage ill Fortune, the meeting of an empty Cart, a wild Oxe, an Ass, a Dog, if he be
not eating somewhat, a Goat, an Ape, a Deer, a Goldsmith, a Carpenter, a Lock-smith, a
Barber, a Taylor, a beater of Cotton, a Widow, a company of People going to the enterment
of a dead Body, or a Man returning from the same Ceremony; as also, that of a
Man or Woman carrying Butter, Oyl, Milk, brown-Sugar, Citrons, or any other sharp
things, Apples, Iron, or any thing relating to War. They are on the contrary, well pleased
with the meeting of an Elephant, or Camel, whether they be loaden or not, as also of a
Horse, a Cow, an Oxe, a wild Oxe loaden with water, a He-Goat, a Dog eating, a Cat
coming on the right hand of them, and Persons loaden with Provisions, Curds and white-Sugar;
but above all, that of a Cock, or a Hare, and then they cheerfully go about what
they have to do, as being prepossess'd with the opinion they have, that the success of their
Affairs will be answerable to their expectations.
               There are some who put the Rasboutes into the number of the Benjans,Rasboutes their belief. and affirm, that
they are a branch of the Sect of Samarath, with which they believe the transmigration

of Souls, and several other things. But they believe this in particular, that the Souls of
Men go into Birds, who afterwards give their Friends notice of the good and evil which
is to befall them: upon which account it is, that they so superstitiously observe the flight
and singing of those Creatures. Their Widows burn themselves with the bodies of their
deceased Husbands, unless it be, that, at the contract of Marriage, there was some promise
made that they should not be forc'd thereto. But whereas all the other Benjans are of a
mild and reserv'd disposition, abhorring the effusion of bloud, even that of Beasts; these
on the contrary, are a sort of violent and daring people, who eat flesh, and live only by murther
and rapine, and never mind any other profession then that of Arms. The Mogul
makes use of these Men, as do also most of the other Princes of the Indies, because they
are undaunted, and entertain not the least fear of death. To this purpose, there is a Story
of five Rasboutes,A Story of five Rasboutes. who forc'd by weariness to rest themselves in a Country mans house,
there happened to be a Fire in the Village, which by reason of the wretchedness of the
houses, soon came to that where they were. They had notice of it, but one of them said
to the rest, that having never turn'd their backs from danger, it would be the greatest
shame in the world to them, to shun death, which they had never fear'd: That it were
baseness in them to stir thence, but that they were to make the Fire as much afraid of
them, as others were of it, and force it to stop its progress when it came near them; and
they were so earnestly engag'd in these temerarious and extravagant discourses, that the
Fire getting into the Room where they were, one only had the time to get out, and to
drag along with him one of his Camerades, who could never afterwards be recover'd out
of the melancholly regret he had conceiv'd, at his not having follow'd the example of the
others.
               It is related also of another Rasboute, who going into the Country, in the company of
two others, came in his way to a Pit, at the sight whereof his Horse stood still; but the
Rasboute condemning the caution of the Beast, as if it had proceeded from fearfulness,
told him, that he was very much to blame to entertain any fear, having on his back a Man
that never knew any; and thereupon beating him, he would have made him leap over
the Pit; but, both Horse and Man falling, they were both drown'd, the Man acquiring
among them, by this inconsiderable and brutish action, the reputation of a Man heroically
courageous.
               They have no compassion but what they have towards irrational Creatures, especially
Birds,Their Charity towards Bids. which they take the pains to keep and feed, out of a perswasion, that one day, when
their Souls shall be lodg'd in Creatures of that kind, some or other will have the same charity
towards them. And this is their employment particularly on Holy-dayes, as also for
ten or twelve dayes after the decease of their nearest Kindred, and upon the anniversary
dayes of their death.
               They have this common with the other Benjans, that they marry their Children very
young,They marry their Children very young. which is the less to be wondred at, inasmuch as it is very certain, that the Indians
of both Sexes are capable of engendring much sooner then any other Nation: so that
there are not any but are fit for the work of generation at ten or twelve years of age. To
this purpose I have a Story, which may seem fabulous, but I have it from such grave persons,
that I shall make no difficulty to communicate it upon their credit.
               Not many years since,A remarkable Story. even in the reign of Scach Choram, who is yet living, a certain
Rasboutes Wife, who liv'd at Agra, was brought to bed of a Daughter, which at two years
of age had Breasts as big as those of any Nurse. A Lock-smith, neighbour to the Rasboute,
advised the Father and Mother to permit, that the hot Iron might be apply'd thereto,
which is the ordinary remedy they make use of against superfluous humours. They consented
thereto; but as soon as they had applied the foresaid Remedy, the Lock-smith died,
and soon after, the Father and Mother, and all those that had been present at the said cure.
The child had at three years of age, what those of her Sex are not wont to have till
twelve or thirteen. The year after she had nothing of that kind, but her Belly was so
swollen as if she had been with child. That swelling was little abated the year following,
and at six years of age she was brought to bed of a Boy. But this was thought a thing
so extraordinary all over the Country, though they marry very young, as I said before, that
Schch Choram sent for both Mother and Child, and ordered them to be brought up at the
Court.
               Besides the Benjans, there is yet another sort of Pagans in the Kingdom of Guzuratta,
whom they call the Parsis.The Parsis. These are the Persians of Fars and Chorasan, who fled into
those parts, to avoid the persecution of the Mahumetans in the seventh Age. For Abubeker,
having undertaken to establish the Mahumetan Religion in Persia by force of Arms, the
King perceiving it was impossible for him to oppose it, took shipping with eighteen thousand

men at Ormus, and landed in Indosthan. The King of Cambaya, who was a Hindou,
or Indian, that is, a Pagan, as himself, received him to dwell in his Country, into which that
liberty drew several other Persians, who, with their Religion, have preserv'd and continued
their ancient manner of life.Their manner of life. Their habitations are for the most part along the Sea-coast,
and they live very peaceably, sustaining themselves by the advantage they make out of the
Tobacco they plant, and the Terry they get out of the Palms of those parts, and whereof
they make Arak, in regard they are permitted to drink Wine. They intermeddle also
with Merchandise, and the exchange of Money, and keep Shops, and are of all Trades,
except those of Farriers, Black-smiths, and Lock-smiths; in regard it is an unpardonable
sin among them to put out the fire.
               The Parsis believe that there is but one God, Preserver of the Universe: That he acts
alone, and immediately, in all things; and that the seven Servants of God, for whom they
have also a great Veneration, have only an inferiour administration, whereof they are oblig'd
to give an account.
               The first of these Servants is called Hamasda,The seven Servants of God. and hath the Government of Men, and
his charge is, to induce them to the exercise of good Works.
               The second, whom they call Bahman, hath the oversight of Cattel, and presides over all
the living Creatures that are upon Earth.
               The third, named Ardybesh, preserves Fire, and hinders it from being put out.
               The fourth is called Sarywar, and is entrusted with the charge of Metals, about which
they are very curious; and accuses those who neglect the making of them clean; which
negligence is a mortal sin among them.
               The fifth, whom they call Espander, hath a care of the Earth, and keeps it from being
pollutd, and hinders it from being otherwise used then it ought.
               Awaerdath, who is the sixth, hath the same charge over the Water, as Espander hath
over the Earth, and keeps it from being defiled with filth.
               The seventh, whom they call Ammadath, looks to the preservation of Fruits, Trees,
Herbs and Pulse, but without any power either to advance or retard their production.
For these seven subalternate Spirits are appointed by God, only to take cognizance of the
abuses committed in this World, and to make their report thereof to him.
               Besides these seven Servants,Twenty six other Servants of God. whose dignity is very great, God hath twenty six other
Servants, who have all their particular Functions.
               The first, whom they call Saroch, takes possession of the Soul immediately upon its departure
out of the Body, and conducts it before two Judges, whom they call Meer Resus,
and Sros, to be examined, and to receive according to their Sentence, either its condemnation
or absolution from its sins. Their manner of proceeding in judgment, is, to put the
good and evil Works into two Scales, that they may judge of them according to their
weight. The good and evil Angels stand about the Scales, and carry away the Souls adjudged
to them, either into Paradise, where they enjoy eternal bliss, or into Hell, there to be
tormented to the end of the World, which they believe will be renewed at the expiration
of a thousand years; and then, they shall enter into other Bodies, to lead a better life then
they had done in the former.
               The fourth of these Servants is called Beram, and hath the oversight of all Military affairs;
upon which account it is that they address themselves to him, that they may obtain
of God Victory, by his Intercession.
               The fifth is Carraseda, that is to say, the Sun.
               The sixth Auva, that is, the Water.
               The seventh is called Ader, and governs the Fire, under Ardy besth.
               The eighth is Moho, or the Moon.
               The ninth is Tiera, that is, Rain.
               The tenth, called Gos, hath the oversight of Cattel.
               The eleventh, who is called Farwardy, hath the custody of the Souls which are in Paradise.
               The twelfth, named Aram, is he that gives Joy or Sadness to Mankind.
               The thirteenth, named Goada, governs the Winds, and makes them blow as he
pleaseth.
               Dien, who is the fourteenth, teaches Men the Law of God, and inspires them with good
motions to observe it.
               Apirsanich, who is the fifteenth, is he who bestows Wealth on Men.
               Astaet, who is the sixteenth, is he that gives Men Understanding and Memory.
               The seventeenth, whom they call Assaman, is Superintendent over Commerce.
               The eighteenth, called Gamigat, hath the Government of the Earth.
               
                  
Marispan, who is the nineteenth, is Goodness it self, who is communicated to those that
invocate him.
               They call the twentieth Amiera, and his Presidentship is over Money, whereof he hath
the disposal.
               The one and twentieth is called Ho??m, and is he, without whose concurrence there happens
no Generation of Men, or Beasts, or Production of Fruits.
               Dimma and Berse, are indifferently design'd to attend all Men: and the three remaining,
whom they call Dephader, Dephemer, and Dephdin, are engag'd upon the particular Service
of God, who imployes them about all Affairs indifferently.
               The Parsis, who call these twenty six Servants by one general name, Geshoo, that is to
say, Lords, believe, that they have an absolute power over the things whereof God hath
entrusted them with the Administration. Whence it comes, that they make no difficulty
to worship them, and to invocate them in their extremities, out of a perswasion, that God
will not deny them any thing they desire upon their Intercession.
               They have a very great respect for their Doctors and Teachers, and allow them a very
plentiful subsistance, with their Wives and Children, though some among them intermeddle
also with Merchandise, which they are permitted to do according to their Law; but
these are not so highly esteemed, as those others who spend all their time in teaching Children
to read and write,They have no Mosqueys. and explicating their Law to the people. They have no Msqueys,
nor other publick places, for the Exercise of their Religion: but they make use, to that
purpose, of some room in their houses, where they do their devotions sitting, and without
any inclination of the body.
               Nor have they any particular day in the week design'd for that end, but they observe
the first, and twentieth day of the Moon. Though their Moneths consist of thirty dayes
a piece, yet does their Year consist of 365. dayes, for they add five dayes to the last Moneth.
Their Priests are not known by their habit, in regard it is common to them, not only with
all the rest of the Parsis,The bodge of their Religion??? but also with all the other Inhabitants of the Country; from
whom they are distinguish'd by a String or Wreath of Wooller Camels Hair, wherewith
they make them a Girdle, which comes twice about the body, and is ty'd with two knots
behind, which is the only distinctive mark of their Religion, and so inseparable from their
Profession, that if it happen to be lost, he who is so unfortunate as to have lost it, may neither
eat, nor drink, nor speak, nay not stir from the place where he is till another be brought
him from the Priest who sells them. The Women wear of them as well as the Men, after
they are come to twelve years of age, at which time they are thought capable of comprehending
the Mysteries of Religion.
               Their houses are little and dark,Their Houses. very poorly furnish'd, and they have a great affection
to live in the same quarter. They have no particular Magistrate among them, yet do they
not think much to accept of the employments which the Mahumetans give them, and
create among themselves two of the most considerable of the Nation, who decide
such differences as may arise, and for which they never plead before any other
Judges.
               There is nothing so precious among them as Fire,Fire is accounted sacred among them. which they keep in very carefully,
upon this account, as they affirm, that there is not any thing affords so lively a representation
of the Divinity as Fire does. Whence it comes, that they never put out a Candle, or
a Lamp, and never make use of Water to quench the Fire, though the House were in danger
of being burnt; but they endeavour to smother it with Earth. For it is the greatest
misfortune can happen to them, to find the Fire so far out in their Houses, as that they must
be forc'd to go out among their Neighbours to get some.
               They also marry their Children while they are very young, but they suffer the Parents
to bring them up at their own Houses, till they are come to fifteen or sixteen years of age,
and then they consummate the marriage. Their Widows are permitted to marry the second
time; whence it comes that there are not so many disorders committed among them,
as there are among the other Nations.They severely punish Adultory. But Adultery and Fornication are the greatest sins
they can commit, and which, no doubt, they would punish with death, if they had the administration
of Justice in their own hands.
               When any one is so sick, as that there is little hopes of his recovery, he is taken out of
his bed,Their manner of burial. to be laid on a little bed of green Turfs upon the ground, where he lies till he give
up the ghost, and immediately after, five or six Men, whose imployment it is to make the
Graves, take him from the said Pallat of Turfs, put a Shroud about him, and lay him upon
an Iron-grate, made after the form of a Biere, upon which they carry the body to the place
of burial, which is above a League from the City. These places, or, if we may call them
so, Church-yards, are divided into three parts, all inclosed with a Wall of twelve or fifteen

foot high, one whereof is for the Men, another for the Women, and the third for Children.
Over the Graves there are Bars laid cross like a Grate, upon which they lay the body, there
to remain till the Crows and other devouring Birds have consumed them, so as that the Bones fall into the Grave. The Kindred and Friends accompany the Corps with horrid
cries and lamentations, and make a halt when they are come within 500. paces of the
Grave, till such time as the Grave-makers have laid it upon the Grate, and made certain
Prayers for the Sonl. About a moneth or six weeks after, they carry the Turfs upon which
the deceased party died, to the Church-yard, as a thing polluted, which they would not so
much as touch; and every moneth they make a Feast for the nearest of the Kindred, in
memory of the departed. If it happens that they touch a dead Carkass, or the Bones of
a dead Beast, they are oblig'd to cast off their cloaths, to cleanse their bodies, and to do pennance
for nine dayes together, during which, neither Women nor Children dare come near
them. They are of this particular perswasion, that they whose Bones chance to fall into
the Water, are irrecoverably damned.
               Their Law forbids the eating of ought that hath had life; yet are not these prohibitions
so rigorous, but that in case of necessity, nay even in the time of war, they kill Sheep,
Goats, tame Fowl and Fish, and eat thereof: But they religiously abstain from the Oxe and
Cow, nor do they kill Elephants, Camels, Horses or Hares; but as to the Oxe and Cow,
they forbear them so strictly, that they commonly say, they had rather feed on their Fathers
and Mothers then eat of an Oxe or Cow.
               They are permitted to drink Wine and Terry,Drunenness. but are forbidden the drinking of Aquavitae,
and above all things, being overcome with drunkenness: This is a sin among them,
which cannot be expiated without undergoing a very severe pennance, which a man must
either submit to, or be content to quit their communion.
               Their stature is none of the greatest, but they are of a clearer Complexion then any of
the other Indosthans, and their Women are beyond comparison whiter and fairer then those
of the Country, or those of the Mahumetans. The Men wear great bushy Beards, cut
round or somewhat Spade-wise. Some cut off their Hair, others let it grow to the full
length. Those who cut their Hair, leave growing on their Crowns a Lock or Tust about
an inch in compass.
               They are the most self-ended and covetous sort of people in the World, using all possible
industry to over-reach and circumvent those they trade withall, though otherwise they
have an aversion for theft. They are of a better Nature then the Mahumetans, at least if
it may be said there is any good Nature consistent with a self-seeking mind, when it is once
possessed with the basest and most infamous of all Vices, Avarice.
               There are in the Kingdom of Guzuratta two other sorts of Pagans,The Indous. one whereof are
the Indous, who come out of the Province of Multhan, and the parts about Asmeern, and
are not Benjans, inasmuch as they kill all sorts of Beasts, and eat thereof, excepting only the
Oxe and Cow. They eat their Meals within a Ring or Circle, within which they permit
not the Benjans to enter. They are for the most part Souldiers, and the Mogul makes use
of them for the keeping of the most considerable places of his Kingdom. The other sort
comes out of the Kingdom of Baghenal, which is commonly called the Kingdom of Golanda,Jentives.
and they are called the Ientives.
               These are a sort of very ignorant people, who refer themselves, as to matter of Religion,
to their Bramans.Their belief. They believe, that in the beginning there was but one God, who
took others into a participation of his power, according as Men came to deserve that
honour by their heroick Actions; and it is to this kind of Saints that they build Masqueys.
               They believe the Immortality and Transmigration of Souls, upon which perswasion
they abhor the effusion of bloud. Accordingly are there not to be found any Robbers or
Murtherers among them; but on the other side, they are generally Lyars and Cheats, in
which good qualities they exceed all the other Indians. They severely punish Adultery,
but they so openly permit Fornication, that there are whole Families among them, whom
they call Bagawaro, who prostitute themselves publickly.
               Besides all these, they have yet among them another sort of people, whom they call
Theers,Theers. who are neither Pagans nor Mahumetans, for they have no Religion at all. They
are altogether imployed about the scouring of Wells, Sinks, Common-Shores, and Privies,
as also the fleaing of dead Beasts, whose flesh they eat.
               They also conduct condemn'd persons to punishment, and are sometimes the Executioners
of them. Whence it comes that they are an abomination to all the other Indians,
who are oblig'd to purifie themselves from head to foot, if any of these people, whom, upon
that occasion, they call Alchores, should touch them. Which is the reason that they

suffer them not to live within Cities, but assign them Habitations in the extremities of the
Suburbs, that they may be as far as may be conveniently from the conversation of other
men.
               We shall not make it our business here to speak of the Religion of the Mahumetans,
wherewith the Kingdom Guzuratta is peopled, in regard that, some few points only exepted,
it is common to them with the Turks and Persians, whereof there hath been an
account given in the precedent Travels of the Embassadors. But we shall continue a
little further the digression wherein we are ingag'd, and treat of the manner of life
of the Mahumetans of the Indies, which is much different from that of the Turks and
Persians.
               We will begin with their Ceremonies of Marriage.The marriage Ceremonies of the Indian Mahumetans. The Friends on both sides being
agreed, and the Wedding-day appointed, there is brought to the Bridegrooms door a Horse,
whose Mane and Crupper are beset with all sorts of Flowers, as is also the piece of Network,
wherewith they cover the Bridegrooms face, who gets on horseback, accompanied
by his Kindred and Friends, having on each side two Pages carrying Umbrelloes of painted
Paper, and before him Musick, and certain Men, who cast into the Air, Squibs, Crackers, and
other Fire-works. In this Equipage he passes through the principal Streets of the City,
and at last comes to the Brides door, where he entertains her with his Musick and Fireworks,
for the space of half an hour. Then he goes into the house, where he sits down on
pieces of Tapistry, purposely set there for that Ceremony; and whither the Bride comes
to him accompanied by her Kindred, and the Molla and Kasi, or Judge of the place. The
Molla reads certain passages of the Alchoran; and after he hath taken the Bridegrooms
Oath, that in case of Divorce, he will provide for the subsistence of his Wife, he blesses the
marriage, and goes his way. The rest of the company stay in the room to eat Bettel??, and
some other Drugs, but they drink no Wine, instead whereof, they take Pills of Amsion or
Opium,The effects of Opium. which works the same effect, and intoxicates them as Wine does. The Kindred
and Friends continue their Assemblies, five or six, sometimes eight or ten dayes together,
especially when the marks of the Consummation of marriage are apparent upon the sheets
of the new married couple. But if the Bridegroom find it more beaten and common then
he expected, he uses it as a high-way, and without any more ado abandons it to the publick;
as on the contrary, if he be not able to force himself a passage, and that in the three
or four first dayes of his marriage, he gives not visible assurances of his abilities in the work
he hath undertaken, one of the Brides nearest Kinswomen sends him a Distaffe, with this
message; That since he is incapable of doing mans work, 'tis but fit he should be put to
womans.
               Their marriages are not indissoluble,They may be divorced. as they are among Christians, nay indeed among the
other Mahumetans, among whom there is no Divorce made, till the grievances of the parties
be first examined, and after that, not without the authority of the Judge. But here the
men make it an express Article in their Contracts of marriage, that they may be divorced,
not only in case of Adultery or sterility, but also in case of ever so little aversion they may
conceive against their Wives; provided some course be taken by them for their subsistence,
during their lives.
               Not a word of any restitution of Dower, in regard the Women there do not bring their
Husbands any thing besides their Clothes and Jewels: Nor indeed is there any but have
their Pendants, Rings and Bracelets, of each good store.
               The Women go seldom abroad, and those that are of any quality go in close Coaches, or
are carried in Palanquins, or Litters, according to the Indian mode. There are indeed
those who ride on horseback, but they have their faces cover'd with a Skarf; so that they
are only the meaner sort, or the common ones, that go a foot, or are seen with their faces
uncovered. They are deliver'd without any pain almost, in so much that it is seldom seen
there that Women are above two or three hours in labour.
               The Mahumetans bring up their Children with much care and tenderness,They bring up their Children well. send them to
School as soon as they are capable of learning any thing; and there they are taught to
read and write. Those who are not of ability to maintain their Children at School, bestow
them on some person of quality, or send them to the Wars, as soon as they are able to
bear Arms. They who put themselves into the service of others, enter into a very unhappy
condition; inasmuch as they are allow'd but three or four Ropias a moneth, towards
meat, drink and cloath.
               It is observed, that the Children of the Mahumetans have a particular tenderness of
those that brought them into the world; nay, that it is sometimes so great, that they would
rather starve themselves, then suffer those from whom they derive their life, should want
any thing requisite for the preservation of their own.
               
                  
There is hardly any person of quality, but makes him a handsom Garden, within which
he builds a fair house, having a great number of little windows of all sides, which is to
serve for a place of Sepul for them, and all their Family after them; in these kinds of
Structures they lay out vast sums of money.
               The Ceremonies of their Interments are these.Their Interments. Immediately upon the Departure, the
Kindred bewail the deceased, and ask him, why he would dye? and whether he wanted
those conveniences which he should have had? &c. Then they dine, and there is a Feast
made, in memory of the deccased. In the mean time, the Body is well washed, there is a
clean perfum'd Sheet wrapped about it, and it is put into an open Coffin, from which three
or four Mollas never stir, but continue near the Body, reading and praying for the Soul of
the deceased, till it be carried to the ground. The Coffin is cover'd with Cotton, Velvet,
or some other more precious Stuffe, according to the abilities of the deceas'd, and the
Kindred and Friends accompany the Body, which is carried by ten or twelve Men to the
place of burial, the Mollas singing in the mean time certain Hymnes, of thanksgiving
Songs, to the glory of God. The Body is laid down upon the right side, with the Face
turned towards the West, the Feet towards the South, and the Head towards the North;
and the Coffin is covered with a board, to keep the Earth from touching the Body, and
defiling it. While the Body is let down into the Grave, the Kindred mutter certain Prayers
between their teeth; and that done, all the company returns to the house of the deceased,
where the Mollas continue their Prayers for his Soul, for the space of two or three
dayes: and during all this time, there is no fire made within the house, but the meat is
dressed elsewhere.
               They assume the quality of Mussulmans,They are called Mansulmans or Mussulmans. and believe that there is no salvation out of their
Communion, treating as Hereticks and Infidels, not only the Christians, but also all such as
profess any other Religion then theirs. Nay, they would not eat of what a Christian or
Pagan had dress'd, unless it be Bread, Butter, Cheese, Preserves, or any thing of that kind.
They have a far greater aversion for the Roman Catholicks then they have for the Protestants,
upon this account, that they cannot endure the worshipping of Images, nor the Adoration
of things visible.
               They are for the most part of a good stature,Their stature and complexion. and there are few hunch-back'd or lame
among them. They among them who are called Mogolies, are of a clearer Complexion
then the others, but they have all their Hair black, and without curling.
               They love not flaxen or fair hair'd people, and have an aversion for such as are red hair'd,
out of an opinion they have, that they are Leprous. For that Disease is very common in
those parts; nay the more in this regard, that the Pox, which is no less common, is never
so well cured, but that it leaves some corruption in the bloud, which by insensible degrees
infects the whole body, and, in time, degenerates into Leprosie. The Mollas
suffer their Beards to grow, but all the rest shave, not only their Beards, but also their
Heads, excepting only a little tuft, or lock, which they leave upon the Crown; upon
this perswasion, that by the said lock, Mahumet is to take them and lift them up to
Heaven.
               Both Men and Women are cloath'd much after the same manner.Their Habit. Their Garments,
which are of Cotton, Silk, or Brocadoe, according to the several qualities of the persons,
are close above, like our close Coats, but from the waste downwards they grow wider and
wider, till they come to the small of the leg, where their breeches, which come down to
the feet, are gathered into many folds. Their Shooes are of Spanish Leather, or some
Silk-stuffe, or Brocadoe, the quarters very low, in regard they put them off ever and
anon, when they go into their Chambers, the Floors whereof are covered with Tapistry.
As to what they wear about their Heads, it is rather like that of the Turks then that of
the Persians, and is made of a very thin Stuff, of Cotton or Silk, and wrought with
Gold or Silver Thread. They call it Shees, and never put it off, but when they go to
bed. Upon their ordinary Garment, they wear a kind of Cloak, which they call Pomereis, against the Cold and Rain. They tye their Garment about with a Girdle, which
they call Commerbant, which is made of a Silk-stuffe, wrought with Gold Thread, upon
which they have another, which is a larger, of a very fine Cotton. Persons of Quality
wear in their Girdles a kind of Armes or Ponyards, short and broad, which they call
Ginda, or Catarre, the handle and sheath whereof are of Gold, and many times set with
precious Stones.
               The Houses of Persons of Quality are spacious enough,Their Houses. and consist of several Appartments,
Halls, Chambers and Closets. The Roofs of their Houses are flat, so as that
a Man may go upon them, to take the fresh Air, and lye there in the night. There
is no House almost, but hath its Garden and Tanque; but their Buildings are poor,

for their Walls are but of Earth, plaistered over with a Composition, made of Freestone
beaten small, Lime, Gum and Sugar, which makes a dazling white, and is
as smooth as Glass. Their Houses are but poorly , even the Kitchin
it self, where you see only a few Dishes and Stoves: but the Women in
their own Lodgings take no small pride in setting out their Gold and Silver
Plate.
               The Men receive their Visits in a Hall,The Ceremonies of their Visits. where they sit on several pieces of Tapistry: At
their entrance into the Room they mutually salute one another with their Salom, which
they accompany with a low inclination; and if the Person whom they salute be of Quality,
they put the right hand to their heads, to shew the power they are willing he should
have over them. When there is no submission due on either side, the Visitants think it
enough to salute one the other only with an inclination of the body, and sometimes they
take one another by the lock, saying Grab anemcas, that is, be it to you according to the
prayers of the poor. He who receives visits keeps his place, and causes those who come to
see him, to sit on both sides of him. They are very civil and very reserved in their conversation,
insomuch that they are never seen contesting or loud in their discourse, and never
use any gestures of either the hand or the head. When they would whisper to any one,
they cover their mouth with a Skarf or Napkin, lest their breath should offend the person
whom they speak to. They who make Visits about business, take leave as soon as they
have done; but intimate Friends continue their Visits, till the Master of the house be called
to dinner.
               They are very expensive in Cloaths,Their expence. Feasting and Women; for their Law allowing
them to take all pleasures imaginable, provided they do not injure their Neighbours, they
are willing enough to make their advantage of that permission, and so pursue all the delight
their hearts can wish. When they eat, they sit upon Tapistry, and are served by a
Carver. They have no Napkin, nor need any, for they never touch the Meat with their
hands.
               They keep as many Servants as they can maintain,Their Domesticks. assigning every person his particular
Employment, wherein the others are so exact, that they who are appointed to do one thing,
will not do the least service for another. For a Selvidar, whose place it is to look to the
Horses, will not meddle with an Oxe, or do any thing about the Cart, because that is the
duty of the Belluwan. The Serriewan hath the oversight of the Camels, and the Mahout
that of the Elephants.
               The Frassy looks to the Tents and Tapistry; and the Santeles are Lacqueys. These
have a great Plume of Feathers on their Heads, and two little Bells upon their Breasts, and
will easily travel fifteen or sixteen Leagues a day. They are not kept in the House, but
have their Wages, on which they live, though it amounts not to above three or four Ropias
a Moneth. But they have withall certain Vails, calied Testury; yet with all the
Advantages they can make of their services, it is as much as they can do to subsist.
               Their greatest expence is that which they are at about their Wives. For being permitted
to have three or four, if they please, they are oblig'd to maintain them, with their Eunuchs
and Slaves, according to their quality, by allowing them a certain sum monethly, as
also by finding them Cloaths, Pearls, and Houshold-stuffe. Their Polygamy hath this convenience
in it, that there is no Woman, but uses all Industry and Artifice imaginable to gain
her Husbands affection, and defeat her Rivals. All the caresses, all the kindnesses she can
think of, she makes use of to ingratiate her self.
               There is no Drug eminent for its veneral Vertues, but she will find out some means or
other to give him, to excite him to Voluptuousness; and she thinks no complyance too
great, to purchase his more frequent enjoyments. They have also a great kindness for the
Eunuchs, in whose custody they are, to engage them to afford them more liberty in their
restraint, which they brook so ill, that in those parts a man would think Polygamy should
rather be permitted the Women then the Men.
               But of all,The condition of Tradesmen. Tradesmen are in the saddest condition, in as much as the Children cannot
be put to any other Trades then what their Fathers are of, and there is this incouvenience
withall, that a piece of work must pass through three or four hands before it be finished;
so that all they can do is to get five or six pence a day. They must accordingly fare very
poorly, their ordinary Diet being only Kitsery, which they make of Beans pounded, and
Rice, which they boyl together in water till the water be consumed. Then they put thereto
a little Butter melted, and this is their Supper, for all day they eat only Rice and Wheat
in the grain.
               Their Houses are low,Their Houses. the Walls of Earth, and covered with green Turfs. They

make no fire in their Houses; for having nothing that is combustible but Cow-dung, the
stink of that would be insupportable; whence it comes that they burn it before their
Doors. They also rub the walls with the same dung, out of an imagination, that it keeps
away Fleas and other Insects.
               MerchantsMerchants. are infinitely more happy then Tradesmen; but they also have this inconvenience,
that as soon as they have gotten any wealth together, they are exposed to the envy
of the Grandees, who find out wayes to flecce them, as soon as they make any shew of it.
And whereas they cannot do it with Justice, they many times make use of such pretences
as cost those their lives who have acquired excessive riches.
               All the Mahumetans of these parts may be said to profess the same Religion; but they
have among them certain Superstitions, and particular manners of life, whereby they are
distinguished into several Sects, though it may be also alledged, that they are to be accounted
rather so many Nations, then different Sects. For when they are distinguished into Patans,
Moguls, or Mogollies, and Indosthans, who are subdivided into many other more considerable
Fractions, as Sayet, Seegh, and Leet, it must be confess'd, that if there be any difference in their
humours, and manner of life, they brought it out of the Countreys whence they came,
and that it is not to be attributed to their Religion. For it is certain that the PatansPatans.
are those, who in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours, are called Padars, a sort
of self-conceited, insolent, cruel, and barbarous people. They sleight others, for no other
reason, then that they are not so rash as themselves in hazarding their lives without any
necessity.
               The Moguls,Moguls, on the contrary, who came out of great Tartary, are good natur'd, mild,
discreet, civil, obliging, and full of complyance; whence it comes, that they are more respected
then the others.
               The Indosthans,Indosthan
                   or Hindusthans, are the ancient Inhabitants of the Country, and distinguish'd
from the rest by their colour, which is much blacker then that of the two former.
These are a Rustical sort of people, and covetous, and not so ingenious and crafty as the
Patans and Moguls.
               In the Province of Haca-chan, there lives a certain people, whom they call Blotious,Blotious. who
are of a strong constitution, and courageous, as the Patans. They are for the most part
employed about the carriage of Merchandises, they let out Camels, and undertake the
Conduct of the Caffilas, and this they do with so much fidelity, that they would rather
lose their lives, then endure the reproach of having lost any thing committed to their
charge.
               There are no common Inns in all the Kingdom of Guzuratta,No Inn in Guzuratta??? nor indeed in all the Mogul's
Countrey; but instead thereof, in Cities, as also in some Villages, there are certain
publick Buildings, called Sarai, built by some persons out of Charity, for the convenience
of Strangers and Travellers, who, were it not for those, would be forc'd to lie in the open
Air. These are the Caravanseras, which have only the four walls, and a covering over
head; so that to be accommodated therein, a Man must bring along with him what is not
to be had there.
               In travelling through the Countrey, they make use of Camels, Mules, Horses and Oxen.
They have also a kind of Coaches, for two or three persons, which are drawn by Oxen,
whereto they are so accustomed, that they easily go ten or twelve leagues a day. The upper
part or covering of these Coaches is of Cloath or Velvet; but those which carry Women
are close of all sides.
               Persons of all quality make use also of Elephants, and are sometimes carried in Palanquines,
which are a kind of Litter or Sedans, carried by two men upon their Shoulders
with a bar. They bring up their Elephants with much care, and are at great charge about
them. They delight much in Hawking and Hunting. Their Greyhounds are somewhat
less then ours, but they tame Tigers and Leopards, whereof they make use in hunting,
and these surprise their prey at a sudden leap, but they never pursue it.
               They are particularly industrious at the catching of River-fowl, by means of the Skin
of a tame Duck, which being fill'd with Hay, they swim even with the Water, and drawing
the Decoy-duck after them, they insensibly get among the others, and take them by the
feet, without ever frighting them.
               They are very expert at the Bow,Their expertness at the Bow. which they make of a wild Oxes horn, and the Arrows
of a very light kind of Cane; nay, they are so excellent at it, that sometimes they
will take a Bird flying.
               They delight much in Chess, and have also a kind of Game at Cards. They
are lovers of Musick, though there be no great Harmony in their own. But above
all things they are besoed with judiciary Astrology, in so much that they never

undertake any business of consequence, but they first consult the Minatzim.
               They have some of Aristotle's Works translated into the Arabian tongue,They have some of Aristotle's, and Avicenna's Works. which they
call Aplis, as also some Treatises of Avicennas, for whom they have a very high respect, because
he was born at Smarcanda, under the jurisdiction of Tamerlam. Their Writings are
not ill, and their Productions are not void of Eloquence. They keep a Register of all the
remarkable Actions that are done among them, and have such an exact account thereof, as
might serve to write a History of the Countrey.
               Of their Language there are many Dialects,Their Language. but it is easie enough to be learnt, and
they write as we do, from the left hand to the right. Most of any quality about the Mogul's
Court speak the Persian tongue; nay some, but very few, speak also the Arabian.
               The most common Diseases of those parts are the bloudy Flux,The Diseases of the Country. and burning Feavers;
and the Remedy they ordinarily make use of against them is Abstinence. They have good
store of Physitians, but no Surgeons. Barbers, of which Profession there is a great number,
are they who let bloud, and apply Leeches.
               In the Kingdom of Guzuratta,Winter begins in June. Winter begins towards the end of Iune, and lasts till
September: but there are not such continual Rains there as at Goa, for it rains only in certain
Intervals, and particularly at new and full Moon. The North-wind blows constantly
for six moneths together, and the South-wind for as many. The hottest moneths in the
year are April, May, and the beginning of Iune, during which the sultriness of the weather
is such, that it were insupportable, were it not that some Winds rise ever and anon,
which moderate the excessive heats; but with that convenience they bring along with
them an inconvenience, which is, their raising such an extraordinary Dust, that it deprives
a Man of the sight of the Sun.
               There is a vast Trade driven in many Commodities all over the Kingdom of Guzuratta,The Commerce of Guzuratta.
but particularly in Cotton and Linnen Cloaths, which are in fairness and fineness equal to
those of Holland; as also in several Silk-stuffes, as Contoms, which are of several colours,
Satins, Taffatas, Petolas, Commerbands, Ornis, of Gold and Silk, which Women commonly
make use of to cover their Faces withall, Brocadoes, Tapistry, or Alcatifs, Chitrenges, or
streaked Carpets, to lay over Chests and Cabinets, quilted Coverlets of Silk or Cotton,
which they call Geodris, or Nalis, Tents, Perintos, or Neuhar, which they make use of
instead of Couches, Cadels, or Bed-steads, Cabinets of Lacque, Chess-boards of Tortoise-shell,
Seals, Beads, Chains, Buttons, and Rings of Ivory, Amber, Rock-Crystal, and
Agat,
               The best Indico in the world comes from about Amadabath, from a Village call'd Chrichees,The manner of making Indico.
whence it derives the name. The Herb of which they make it is like that of yellow
Parsnip, but shorter, and more bitter, sprouting forth into branches like a Reed, and growing,
in kind years, six or seven foot high: the Flower is like that of a Thistle, and the
Seed like that of Fenu-greek. It is sown in Iune, and cut in November, and December.
It is sown but once in three years, and the first year the leaves are cut off within a foot of
the ground. The stalks are taken away, and the leaves are set a drying in the Sun, and
that done, they are set a soaking, for four or five dayes, in a Stonestrough, containing about
six or seven foot water, which is ever and anon stirred, till such time as the Water hath
suckt out the colour and vertue of the Herb. That done, they let out the Water into another
Trough, where they suffer it to settle for one night. The next day, all the Water is
taken away, and what is left in the bottom of the Trough is strain'd through a course
Cloath, and is set a drying in the Sun. And this is the best Indico; but the Countrey people
adulterate it, by mixing therewith a certain Earth of the same colour. And whereas
the goodness of this Drug is discovered by its lightness, they have the cunning to put a
little Oyl into it, to make it swim upon the water.
               The second year, the stalk which was left the year before shoots forth other leaves, but
they are not so good as those of the first. Yet is this preferr'd before Gyngey, that is, wild
udico. It is also the second year that they suffer some part of it to grow up to seed. That
of the third year is not good, and consequently not sought after by forraign Merchants, but
is imploy'd by the Inhabitants of the Countrey in the dying of their Cloaths. The best
Indico is almost of a violet colour, and hath somewhat of its smell, when it's burned. The
Indsthans call it Anil; and after it hath been in the ground three years, they suffer the
Land to lye fallow for one year ere they sow it again.
               Most of the Saltpeter which is sold in Guzuratta comes from Asmer,Saltpeter. sixty Leagues from
Agra, and they get it out of Land that hath lain long fallow. The blackest and fattest
ground yields most of it, though other Lands afford some, and it is made thus. They make
certain Trenches which they fill with their Saltpetrous Earth, and let into them small Rivulets,
as much water as will serve for its soaking, which may  the more effectually done,

they make use of their feet, treading it till it become a Broath. When the Water hath
drawn out all the Saltpeter which was in the Earth, they take the clearest part of it, and
dispose it into another Trench, where it grows thick, and then they boil it like Salt, continually
scumming it, and then they put it into earthen pots, wherein the remainder of the
Dregs goes to the bottom; and when the Water begins to thicken, they take it out of
these pots, to set it a drying in the Sun, where it grows hard, and is reduc'd into that form
wherein it is brought into Europe.
               Borax,Borax. or the green Earth which the Goldsmiths make use of in the refining of Gold
and Silver, is found in a Mountain, in the Province of Purbet, under the jurisdiction of the
Raja, Biberom, towards great Tartary; whence there is brought also good store of Spikenard,
Quicksilver, Musk, and Copper, as also a certain colour, which dyes a very beautiful
brown. The Borax grows in the River Iankenckar, which at his coming out of the Mountain
falls into the River Maseroor, which crosses the whole Province, and produces that
Drug, which grows in the bottom of the River, as Coral doth: The Inhabitants of Guzuratta
call it Iankenckhar, and keep it in Pouches of Sheep-skin, which, for its better preservation,
they fill with Oyl.
               The Hingh,Assa foetida. which our Drugsters and Apotheciries call Assa foetida, comes for the most
part from Persia, but that which the Province of Vtrad produces in the Indies is the best,
and there is a great Traffick driven in it all over Indosthan. The Plant which produces it
is of two kinds; one grows like a Bush, and hath small leaves, like Rice, and the other resembles
a Turnip-leaf, and its greenness is like that of Fig-tree leaves. It thrives best in
stony and dry places, and its Gum begins to come forth towards the latter end of Summer,
so that it must be gathered in Autumn. The traffick of it is so much the greater in those
parts, upon this account, that the Benjans of Guzuratta make use of it in all their Sawces,
and rub their Pots and drinking Vessels therewith, by which means they insensibly accustom
themselves to that strong Scent, which we in Europe are hardly able to endure.
               The Amphion, Offion, or Opium,Opium. which is spent in Europe, comes from Aden, or Cayro; but
that which is sold in the Indies comes out of the Province of Gualor, in Indosthan, and is
nothing but the juyce which is got out of Poppy, by an incision made therein, when it begins
to grow ripe. All the Eastern Nations are great Lovers of it, in so much that the
young people, who are not permitted the use of it, and the meaner sort, who are not able
to buy it, will boyl the Poppy it self, and eat of the broath which is made thereof. And
whereas the Poppy among them is called Pust, they thence call those Pusty, who make use
of that broath, instead of Opium. The Persians affirm, that they were the first who made
use of it, and that all other Nations did it in imitation of their Grandees, who took it, at
first, to provoke sleeping. They take every day a small pill of it, about the bigness of a
Pea; not so much in order to sleeping, as that it should work the same effect as Wine does,
which infuses courage and great hopes into those, who otherwise would not discover much
of either. The Caffees, or Messengers, who travel into the Country, take of it to hearten
themselves; but the Indians make use of it for the most part, that they may be the better
fitted for the enjoyments of Women. No doubt but it is a poyson, which kills, if a Man
do not accustom himself thereto by little and little; and when he hath so accustomed himself,
he must continue the frequent use of it, or he dies, on the other side. It so weakens
their Brains who take it continually, that they run the hazard of losing the use of their
Reason, and the principal functions of their Understanding, and become in a manner stupid,
if they recover not themselves by the same Remedy.
               We have spoken already of Lacque, and shall have occasion to say somewhat of it elsewhere.
               We shall therefore here only add, that in GuzurattaThe Drugs of Guzuratta. there grows abundance of Cummin,
Ginger, and Mirobalans, which they traffick much in, both dry'd and preserv'd with brown
Sugar. There are also several other Drugs, which have their use in Physick.
               There are found in the same Kingdom Diamonds,Their precious Stones. but not many, Pearls, Emeralds, Granats,
or Garnets, Agats, &c. Alablaster, red Marble, Jasper-stone, which the Inhabitants
have the Art to polish above all others.
               There is but one kind of weight all over the Kingdom of Guzuratta,Their Weights. which they call
Maon, that is to say, a hand, which weighs fourty Ceers, and makes thirty pounds and a half,
each pound containing sixteen ounces; and a Ceer weighs eighteen Peyses, which is a kind
of brass money that makes about twelve ounces.
               They have two kinds of Ells;Their Measures. the lesser makes but half an Ell, and a sixteenth part of
the measure of France; and nineteen of the greater sort make thirteen Ells three quarters
of the same measure.
               They have also two sorts of Money,Their Money. to wit, the Mamoudies, and the Ropias. The Mamodies

are made at Surat, of Silver of a very base alloy, and are worth about twelve pence
steel. and they go only at Surat, Brodra, Broitschia, Cambaya, and those parts. Over all
the Kingdom besides, as at Amadabath elsewhere, they have Ropias Chagam, which are
very good Silver, and worth half a Crown French money. Their small money is of Copper,
and these are the Peyses we spoke of, and whereof twenty six make a Mamoudy, and fifty
four a Ropia. They also make use of Almonds, whereof thirty six make a Peyse, as also
of certain Shells, which they call Kaurets, and are gathered on the Sea-side, eighty whereof
amount to a Peyse. Spanish Ryals and Rixdollars, are worth there five Mamoudies,
in regard they covert them into their own Coins with much advantage, by the change
they make either to weight or alloy, and many times as to both. They esteem the Larris
of Persia, the Silver whereof is very good. They have also a certain Coin of Gold, which
they call Xeraphins, and is worth about thirteen Ropias and a half; but there are very few
of them. The Chequines, and Ducats of Venice, are more common there, and are worth
eight and a half, and sometimes nine Ropias, Surat money, according to the change, and the
rate set on the money, which rises or falls according to the plenty or scarcity of money,
upon the place where it is paid.
               There is abundance of counterfeit Money coin'd in the Indies,Much counterfeit money in the Indies. whence it comes that
there is no payment made, but it is done before these Changers, whom they call Xaraffes,
who have their Shops at the corners of the principal Streets, and for a small matter, secure
the goodness of the Money, which they are so well acquainted with, that they immediately
discover whether it be counterfeit or not.
               Their ordinary way of accounting is by Lacs, each of which is worth a hundred thousand
Ropias; and a hundred Lacs make a Crou, or Carroa, and ten Carroas make an Areb.
A Theil of Silver makes eleven, twelve, or thirteen Ropias, current money. A Massas and
a half make a Theil of Silver, ten whereof make a Theil of Gold. They call their Brass
or Copper money Tacques; and it is prohibited, upon pain of death, that any should transport
either Gold, Silver, or coined Brass out of the Country.
               Speaking before casually of the fertility of this Country,The fertility of Guzuratta. we said, it wanted not any
thing requisite for the life of Man. It produces Wheat, Rice, Pease, Beans, Barly, Millet
Turkish Wheat, Flax, Mustard-seed, &c. Oyl, Butter, Cheese, though somewhat dry, and
over-salted, to please the palats of Forreigners; and all these it is better stor'd with then
any Province of Europe. Their Wheat is much bigger and whiter then ours, and they
make bread of it,Their way of baking bread. not to be baked in an Oven, as we do, but upon Iron plates. The poorer
sort, and particularly the Benjans, make a kind of Flawns of it in Frying-pans over their fire
of Cow-dung, which they make use of instead of Wood. Their Pease and Benas are somewhat
less then ours, but much more delicate, especially their red Chices, wherewith in some
places they feed their Horses,No Oats in the Indies. Oxen and Buffles, instead of Oats, which is a kind of Grain
not used in the Indies. They do not make any Hay at all, nor ever cut any Grass, but
what is eaten while it is green.Their seed-time and harvest. Their Sowing time is in May, and their Harvest in November
and December.
               There is not any person in the Mogul's Countrey, possess'd of any real Estate in Land.
But when Seed-time is coming on,The Mogul is really possessed of the whole Country. the Peasants apply themselves to the Governour, or
him who is next under the King in the several Provinces, and acquaint him how much
ground they intend to cultivate that year, upon condition to allow the King a third part,
nay sometimes half the profits, in so much that it often happens, that the Peasants hardly
get in the charges they had been at in the manuring of it. On the contrary, the Mogul
leaves all the Meadow-ground to be Common, and makes little or no advantage thereof;
whence it comes, that most Grounds lye fallow, and bring forth only Grass.
               They sow in their Gardens all sorts of Pot-herbs,The Gardens. as Lettice, Succory, Sorrel, Parsley, &c,
Radishes, Navew, Cabbages, Cowcumbers, Citruls, Garlick, Onions, Parsnips of several
kinds; but above all, Melons, which in delicacy exceed those of all other parts. The
Rose only excepted, there is almost no Flower but is sought after more for its colour then
scent: for though those they call Mogera and ceampi have a good smell, yet are the Women
more in love with them for their colour then scent. The former are white, the latter
yellow, and both are to be had all the year long, as also the Grass wherewith all the Fields
are covered, unless it be when the excessive heat of the Summer dries it up.
               Besides the Trees known to us,Trees. and which bring forth Lemmons, Citrons of several
kinds, and Pomegranats; there are also those called Ananas, Banasses, Iaccas, Cocos, and
Fig-trees, of which they most cultivate the Cocos-trees, out of which they get the Terry.
There is also near Surat a kind of Grapes, but much less then those of Persia, and much
dearer then any other Fruit of the Countrey. We shall have occasion to speak of it elsewhere,
and shall therefore only add here, that their Forrests, which are full of these sorts of

Trees, are stor'd, besides the Creatures we have spoken of heretofore, with a kind of wild
Dogs, which they call Iakals; but it is death for any to hurt them, or any of the other
Beasts, that are yellow or black, because that sport is reserv'd for the King, and the Governour
of the Province.
               Their Horses are not comparable to those of Persia and Arabia;Their Horses. yet are they at great
charge in keeping them, allowing a Groom for every Horse, and feeding them after a particular
manner. When they give them of that kind of Pease called Ciches, whereof we
spoke before, called by them Donna, they cause them to be beaten and boil'd. Besides
which, they give them, twice a day, morning and evening, two pounds of Barly-meal,
which they make up into a Paste with half a pound of Butter, and a pound of Sugar.
               The Oxen of this Countrey are of the same making with ours,Their Beef and Mutton. save that they have a
great bunch or rising between the Shoulders. The Mahumetans are the only people that
eat of them, as they do also of Mutton; but they are only the poorer sort that do so. Persons
of quality feed on Kid, which they either roast whole, making a Pudding of Rice,
Almonds, and Raisins of the Sun, in the belly, or they stew them with Butter and Pepper,
which they call Brenghie, and is very good meat. They eat also of those Persian Sheep
that have such fat tails; but this is a very scarce dish, and consequently reserv'd for great
Mens Tables, and extraordinary Entertainments.
               They have also Fowl,Their Fowl. as Capons, Peacocks, Geese, wild-Ducks, Teal, Partridges, Pigeons,
Herons, Sparrows; as also all sorts of Birds of prey, as Faulcons, Tassels, Hawks, Eagles,
&c.
               They want no River-fish,Fish, as Carps, Breams, Eels, &c. and Salt-fish is extraordinary
good, and very cheap, proceeding hence, that the Pagans eat not of it at all, and the Mahumetans
love Flesh better then Fish. They have also all sorts of Shell-fish, as Oysters and
Crabs, and particularly a certain Fish (which in the Maritime Towns of Picardy is called
Cheurette, and is a kind of great Prawn) so big, that a dozen of them makes a good dish.
It is very remarkable, that whereas, upon all the Coasts of Europe, this Fish is best at the
Full-moon, in those parts it is so at the New; and at the Full, Shell-fish are in a manner
empty. The Fish called Tubarons, which devour Men, are often seen in those parts, and
that is one reason why all persons ordinarily bathe and wash themselves in Tankes.
               Their Ships are but poorly built,Their Ships in so much that they have no other way to dispose of
their Artillery but upon the deck, and consequently in the open Air. The greatest Voyages
they make are those of Iava and Sumatra, Eastward; and to Aden and Meca upon the
Red-sea. They sometimes carry above a thousand persons together, who for the most
part go upon Pilgrimage to Meca, that at their return they may be put into the number of
their Hoggoi, or Saints. They set sail at the beginning of the March-Moon, and return in
September, for the tempests, which reign from Iune till that time upon those Coasts, makes
them spend six moneths in a Voyage which might be performed in two.
               The Commodities they transport to the Coasts of Aden,Their trading to the Red-sea. are Cotten, Linnen-cloath, Indico,
Camphire, Tobacco, Allum, Sulphur, Benjamin, Pepper, and other Spices, Mirobalans,
and several other sorts of Preserves, and they bring back very little in Commodities, to
wit, Coral, Amber, Misseit, wherewith they dye red, Kahwa or Coffee-berries, and Opium,
which is accounted the best of all the East; but their best returns consist in Gold and
Silver coined.
               The other Vessels,To the Persian Gulf. which are less, and go from Surat, Cambaia and Broitschia upon the
Coasts of Persia, bring home Brocadoes, Silk-stuffes, Velvets, Chamlets, Pearls, dry Fruits,
as Almonds, Raisms of the Sun, Nuts, and Dates, and above all Rose-water, wherewith
they drive a great Trade. These go away in the moneths of Ianuary and February, and
return in April, or the beginning of May. There are other Ships of a hundred, two hundred,
and three hundred tuns burthen, which carry to Acim, in the Island of Sumatra, all
sorts of the Commodities of the Country,To Achim, and bring home Sulphur, Benjamin, Camphire,
Percelain, Tin and Pepper. These last set sail in May, for this reason, that the Portuguez,
who forbid the selling of Pepper any where but in the Cities where they have established
their Commerce, upon pain of death and confiscation of Goods, and guard the Coast against
the Pirats of the Malabares, draw not into their Havens till that time; and therefore they
must so order their Affairs, that they may be at home again in October, before the Portuguez
set out their Fleets to Sea.
               The Malabares,The Commerce of the Malabares in Guzuratta. who inhabit that part of the Indian Coast, which reaches from Cap di
Rama, ten Leagues from Goa Southward, as far as Cap di Comori, about a hundred and seven,
or a hundred and eight Leagues in length, and comprehends the Cities of Calicut, Onor,
Bacalir, Bacanor, Mangalor, Cananor, and Granganot, have also very great trade at Surat,
Cambaya and Broitschia, and bring thither Cayro, which is the bark of the Cocos-trees,

whereof they make Cordage for Ships: Copera, or the pith of the same: Trees, brown
Sugar, which they call Sigaga, Areca and Bettel??, which they call in their Language, Dimang;
a certain kind of Wood which dyes red, called Patang and Harpus, wherewith
Ships are calked, as also Rice and other provisions. They carry home Opium, Saffron, Coral,
Cotton, Thread, Linnen-cloaths and other Stuffes. They come to Surat and upon the
Coasts, in the moneth of December, and go away in April.
               The Portuguez,The Commerce of the Portaguez. who for a long time had all the advantages of the Trade of Guzuratta,
and were become Masters thereof, by means of the Forts they had built at Daman, Diu,
and Goa, to make their party good against the Malabares, their irreconcileable Enemies,
brought thither Lead, Tin, Vermilion, Quicksilver, all sorts of Woollen-clothes, Ivory,
Sandal-wood, Pepper, Cardomomum, or grains of Paradise, Cloves, Porcelane, China-Stuffes,
Cinnamon, Cocos, Cayro, Vessels of Gold, Vermilion-gilt, made in Europe; and bought there
all sorts of Stuffes, Cotton-clothes, Indico, Saltpeter, Lacque, Sugar, Mirobalans, Preserves,
Bed-steads, Cabinets, and other pieces made of Lacque, which they brought to Goa, and
disposed into their great Ships or Carracks, which set thence for Portugal in Ianuary and
February. They bought there also, Butter, Assa foetida, Opium, Cummin, Cotton and
Thread, to be transported to Malacca, China, and Sapan, where they traded many times at
two hundred upon one hundred profit. But since the English and Dutch setled themselves
in the Kingdom of Guzuratta, they have been forc'd to quit some part of that Trade, and
to content themselves with what they still carry on at Goa, whereof we shall give some
account in the second Book of this Relation.
            
            
               
               MANDELSLO's
TRAVELS
INTO THE
INDIES.
               The Second Book.
               THe English President,IANVARY. Mr. Metwold, who had resign'd his charge in the
Indies to his Successour, Mr. Fremling, having taken all requisite order
for our Voyage, went the first day of Ianuary, 1639. to take his
leave of the Sulthan,1639. who receiv'd him very kindly,Mandelslo leaves Surat. and presented him with a Vestment of Brocadoe, the Collar whereof was made of
two Martins Skins with Sables, which he then had about him; as
also many other rare things, which he entreated him to keep for his
sake. At our coming out of the Sulthans Palace, we were received
into a Shallop, which brought us aboard the Mary, then lying in the Road, two Leagues
from the mouth of the River. The new President, and the chiefest of the English Officers,
accompanied us into the Ship, where they stayed three dayes, entertaining and treating
one another, and drowning in good Wine the affliction which was to ensue upon so
long a separation.
               We set sail the fifth,Comes to Daman. two hours before day, and got at night in sight of the City of Daman,
where we found one of our Ships which was gone before us, to take up a Portuguez
Vessel that was to go along with us to Goa. The Governour sent us a Vessel of Wine,
about the bigness of a Barrel, and some other refreshments, notwithstanding the siege which
the King of Decam, his Neighbour, then maintain'd against the place, but with little good
success, in regard the Haven being not block'd up, the Indians could not prevent the sending
in of relief into the City, even in the day time.
               The Kingdom of Decam, or rather Cuncam, for so it is more commonly called, though
from its Metropolis it sometimes gets the name of Visiapour, reaches all along that Coast,
from Ingediva, which lies within twelve leagues of Goa, towards the South, to a place named
Siffarde. The Neighbouring Princes are, on the North-side, the King Nisamsa, who
is possess'd of the Country which lies between the Province of Dolte babth, within
the Kingdom of Decam, and the Kingdom of Bailama on Daman side; and on the East,
the King of Benghenal, whose residence is in the City of Golcanda, which is corruptly called
Golconda.
               The chief Maritime Cities of the Kingdom of Decam, are Geytapour, Rasapour, Carapatan,
and Dabul; but the Metropolis of the Kingdom is Visiapour, eighty Leagues from
Dabul, and eighty four from Goa.
               The way from Goa to Visiapour lies according to the following direction, which we

thought fit to insert here, purposely to take occasion by that means to discover a good part
of the Country.
               As soon as you come out of Goa,The way from Goa to Visiapour, Ditcauly. you cross the River Madre de dios, to get into the
Country of the King of Visiapour, in which the first place you come to is the City of Ditcauly,
three Leagues from Goa. The Governour of this City is Governour also of the
Fort of Ponda, which is upon the same River. From Ditcauly to Danda are counted six
Leagues.
               This City is of a competent largeness,Danda. and hath very fair Streets. It is seated upon
the River Dery, which falls into the Sea near those Isles, which the Portuguez call
Islas quemadas. Its Inhabitants are Decanins and Benjans, who traffick very much at
Goa.
               From Danda to the Mountain of Balagatta,The Mountain of Balagatta. are nine Leagues, and you pass through the
Villages of Amby and Herpoli, and at the foot of the Mountain, through that of Amboly.
This Mountain reaches along the Kingdom of Cuncam, as far as the Coasts of Coromandel;
and there on the top of it Plains, whose fertility is equal to that of the most pleasant
Valleys.
               From Amboly, to the Village of Herenekassi,Herenekassi. upon the River of the same name, there are
eleven Leagues, and within Cannon shot of it, you pass through the Village of Berouly,Berouly.
which lies in a Valley between the Mountains of Balagatta. Two Leagues thence, you
come to the Village of Werser??e;Werser??e. three Leagues thence, to that of Outor;Outor. and six Leagues
and a half further, to that of Berapour;Berapour. half a League thence, to that of Matoura,Matoura. and
a League thence, to that of Calingra.Calingra. About five hundred paces from Calingra, you
come to the Village of Kangir, and ere you get much further, to a Hamlet, which hath
no other name then that of Bary, which is given to all those places that have no particular
name.
               About a League thence is the Village of Worry,Worry. and half a League further that of Attrowad,Attrowad.
near which, upon an eminent place, there is a very magnificent Pagode, of the
Countrey, or Mosquey, which may be seen at a very great distance. About two Leagues
and a half from this Pagode, you turn upon the left hand, and go through the Village of
BadaralyBadaraly. to Kerwes,Kerwes. which is also two Leagues and a half from Badaraly. From Kerwes
to Skeokory are accounted two Leagues;Skeokory. and from Skeokory, to a very sumptuous Benjane
Pagode, five Leagues.
               From this Pagode may be discovered, at a great distance, the Castle of Mirsis, two leagues
thence, upon the left hand, and you go thence to Rajebag,Rajebag. which is about a league distant
from the said Pagode. Rajebag is a very great City, and drives a great trade in Pepper,
which the Inhabitants transport to Bisnager, and elsewhere.
               It is part of the Dowry of the Queen of Visepour, who hath there a Governour under
her.
               About a League from Rajebag, you come to a very noble Well; about two Leagues
thence, you cross the River Cugny; and about half a League further you come to the City
of Gotteuy.Getteuy. You leave it on the left hand, yet go through one Gate of it, to pass through
the Villages of Goetesi and Omgar, which are but about five hundred paces thence; and
about half a League further, you come to the great River Corstena, which runs through the
whole Kingdom of Decam, as far as Masulypatan. About a League and a half from the
River, you go through the Village of Eynatour, and not far thence, through that of Katerna,
and thence to those of Tangly and Erary, and so to the River Agery, which is distant
thence about a League and a half. About three Leagues further you come to the City of
Atteny, which is so considerable as to be a common Market to all the adjacent Country,
whence are daily brought to it abundance of all sorts of provisions. About four Leagues
thence, you come to the Village of Bardgie, and at three and a half further, pass through
the Village of Agger, which is within three Leagues of the City of Talsengbe, which is distant
from that of Homoware three other Leagues, and thence there are as many to the City
of Ticota, which is within six Leagues of Visapour.
               Before you come to the chief City, you pass through the Villages of Nouraspour and
Sirrapour, which are in a manner its Suburbs, and whereof the former was heretofore the
ordinary residence of the King Ibrahim Schach, who reign'd at the beginning of this last
Age: but now it is wholly ruin'd, and the Materials of its Palace and great Houses are
convey'd thence for the carrying on of those which are building at Visiapour.
               The City of Visiapour is of such largeness, that it is above five Leagues in compass. The
Walls, which are very high, are of Free-stone, encompass'd with a great Ditch, and several
Fortifications, mounted with above a thousand great Pieces, of all sorts, Iron and Brass.

The Kings Palace is in the midst of the City, from which it is divided by a double Wall,
and two Ditches, being above 3500. paces in compass. He who commanded there in the
time of Sulthan Mamedh Idelshach, the Son of Ibrahim, was called Nammouth-chan, by
Countrey an Italian, born at Rome. His command extended also over the City, and the
5000. men who kept Garrison therein, besides the 2000. who were the constant Garrison
of the Castle. The City hath five distinct Suburbs, where the principal Merchants have
their habitations, and particularly in that of Schanpour, where live most of the Jewellers.
The other Suburbs are called Gurapour, Ibrahimpour, Alapour and Bomnenaly. The Inhabitants
are Decanins, that is, of the Kingdom of Decam, or Benjans, Moguls, and Ientives,
of whom an account hath been given before.
               To go from Visiapour to Dabul, you return the same way as far as the City of Atteny,
whence you go to the Village of Agelle, which is two Leagues distant from it, and thence
to the City of Arecq, which is six Leagues and a half from Agelle. From Arecq to the
City of Berce are three Leagues, and thence to Mirsie three Leagues. This City, which
is called also Mirdsi, and Mirisgie, is large, but not very populous, having, on the North-side,
a Castle, so well fortifi'd, that the Mogul, who sometime besieg'd it with all the Forces of
his Kingdom, was forc'd to raise the Siege. In this place are also to be seen the Tombs of
two Kings of Delly, who were enterr'd there above five hundred years since. The Inhabitants
of the City, as also those of the Country thereabouts, have a great veneration for
that place. From Mirdsi to the Village of Epour are two Leagues, and thence to the City
of Graeen three.Graeen two Cities. It is not easily decided, whether it be one City or two, inasmuch as it is
divided only by the great River Corsena, the distance between both parts being about 800.
paces; and there are so many houses on either side of the River, that they may be taken
for two considerable Cities, though one be much less then the other From the River to
the Village of Toncq, are counted two Leagues and a half; thence to that of Astava one,
and thence to the City of Asta two Leagues. Between this last Village and the City,
there is a Hamlet, which is called Barry;  but it is to be observ'd, that this name is given
to all those places which have not any in particular, as we said before. The City of Asta
is very considerable for its trading, and hath a noble Market, where may be had all sorts of
provisions. The Mogul, who sometime came as far as this place with his Army, hath left
behind him sufficient marks of the devastation which attends the marches of such numerous
Armies.
               Having left Asta, you come to the great City of Ballouwa,Baouw??? which is distant from it three
Leagues; and three more thence to those Oren and Isselampour,Oren and Isselampour. which lye distant one from
the other not above a Cannon-shot. You leave the former on the right hand, and the other,
which hath a strong Castle, and its particular Governour, on the left. Two Leagues from
Isselampour, lies the Village of Taffet,Taffet. and three thence, that of Cassegam,Cassegam. whence there are
above two Leagues to the City of Calliar,Calliar. which is wholly destroy'd. Two Leagues thence,
there is a little Village called Galoure,Galoure, whence you pass through the Village of Winge,Winge. and
afterwards by the City of Qualampour,Qualampour. where much Linnen is made, and by that of Domo,Domo.
to the City of Tamba,Tamba. which is six Leagues from Galoure. The City of Tamba is considerable
both for its largeness, and its being very populous. It lies on the other side of a
River, the name whereof I could not learn; for that of Coyna, which they give it, is a general
name, and signifies only a great River. The Inhabitants are Benjans and Ientives,
who live by Commerce and Tillage.
               From the City of Tamba to the Village of Morel are two Leagues, and thence to that
of Suppero two Leagues; to Belour four; and thence to the Town of Werad two Leagues.Werad???
This Town lies nine Leagues from the Mountains of Balagatta, and there is not far from it
a Village, called Patan, which was sometime the retreat of a famous Robber named Hiewogby,
who made all he took pay a certain Ransome: and when ever notice was brought him
of any design against his person, he got into the Mountain, whither it was impossible to
pursue him. From Werad to the Village of Helewacko, and the River which runs by it,
are counted above three Leagues. This River, which comes down from the City of Chaury,
which is thirty six Lagues distant from this Village, hath no other name then that of
the Village, though they give it also that of Coyna, as being indeed the greatest of any in
the Kingdom of Cuncam. From the River to the Village of Gattamatta, which is within
the Mountains of Balagatta, are three Leagues; and thence to the Village of Pory three
more. This Village is seated at the foot of the Mountain, which is at that place very
rough and craggy. Thence to the Village of Camburley are two Leagues, and thence to
that of Chipolone two more: this last Village lies upon the River Ghoyhbeer, which falls
into that which runs by Helwacko; whence it comes, that those who go to Dabul by water
embark at that place, Dabul being sixteen Leagues from it. At the same place they also

embark all the Merchandises which are transported to all parts of the Kingdom, paying a
Larin and a half upon a Candy, which comes to four Quintals, or four hundred weight
and a half carriage.
               The City of Dabul is seated upon the River Kalewacko,The City of Dabul describ'd. at seventeen degrees, forty five
minutes, on this side the Line, though Linschoten puts it at eighteen degrees. It is without
doubt one of the most ancient Cities of the whole Kingdom; but now it hath neither
Gates nor Walls, and all its Fortifications consists in two Batteries, on the Rive-side, upon
which there are four Iron Guns. The Wood, which lies on the left hand as you go into
the River, represents a great Castle; and at the foot of the same Wood may be discover'd
a white Tower, which serves for a Pagode or Mosquey, and is an infallible direction to Pilots.
The entrance into the River is somewhat difficult, there being at the mouth of it a
Sand-bank, which at low-water is dry; so that as you go in, you must alwayes keep towards
the South, in regard that, even at low-water, you have on that side between five and
six fathom water, unless it be at the very mouth of the River, where you have not above
twelve or fourteen foot water at most. The Road is good within a League of the River,
but it is incomparably better four Leagues thence, in the Bay of Zanquizara. Twelve
Leagues thence lyes the Haven or Road of Ceitapour, which is within twenty Leagues of
Goa, at seventeen degrees, ten minutes, and is no doubt the best on all the Coast; for casting
Anchor behind the Island, which shelters it, you need not fear being expos'd to any wind.
Three Leagues thence lyes the City of Rasapour,Rasapour. which is one of the chiefest maritime
Cities of the Kingdom of Cuncam. The Bay of Wingurla, nineteen Leagues from Rasapour,
and three from Islas quemadas, is a convenient Haven, but we shall forbear any further
description thereof, in regard it is not our design at present to afford materials for a Maritime
Map of those parts.
               The Inhabitants of Dabul are either Pagans or Mahumetans, whose principal trading is
in Salt, which is brought thither from Oranubammara, as also in Pepper. Heretofore there
were set forth thence several Vessels for the Gulf of Persia, and the Red-sea; but now
their Commerce that way is so inconsiderable, that they hardly send out three or four
wretched bottoms for Gamron. The Custom paid there is three and a half upon the hundred;
but the English pay only a moyety thereof.
               The Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Cuncam or Decam, though they are for the most
part Benjans, eat any kind of flesh, unless it be that of an Oxe, Cow, Buffle, or wild Oxe,
and a Swine. They have a certain veneration for the Oxe and the Cow; but Swinesflesh
is an abomination to them. As to their manner of life, their Marriages, Entertainments,
Purifications and other Ceremonies, they imitate therein the Benjans of Guzuratta.
Their Houses are of Straw, and the Doors so low, that a Man cannot get in without stooping.
All that's to be seen within them is only a Mat, on which they lie in the night, and
a pit in the ground, wherein they beat their Rice. Their habit is the same with that of
the other Benjans, save that their Shooes, which they call Alparcas, are of wood, ty'd up
over the Instep with straps of Leather. Their Children go naked till they come to seven
or eight years of age, and they are for the most part by profession Gold-smiths: There
are also among them some who work in Brass: they have Physitians, Barbers, Chirurgeons,
Carpenters and Masons, who work for the Mahumetans, the other Benjans, and the
Parsis, whereof there is a greater number in those parts, then there is of Decanins and
Canarius. They make use of the same Armes as the Indosthans do, and they have
this common with them, that they are not so good as either those of Turkey or
Europe.
               Their principal Commerce consists in Pepper, which is transported by Sea into Persia,
to Surat, and into Europe; as also in provisions, wherewith all the neighbouring Provinces
are thence supply'd There are made also in those parts great quantities of Linnencloath,
which is transported by Sea out of the Kingdom; and they traffick much by land
with the Inhabitants of Indosthan, Golcanda, and the Coasts of Coromandel, whither they
carry Cotton-clothes, and Silk-stuffes. There are abundance of Jewellers at Visiapour,
and there is found thereabouts great quantity of Pearls; but it is not there they are to behad
cheapest, since they are brought thither from other places. There is also abundance
of Lacque made in the Mountains of Balagatta; but it is not so good as that of Guzuratta.
               The Portuguez drive a great trade there, especially with the Merchants of Ditcauly and
Bauda, which lye but three or four Leagues from Goa, buying Pepper at seven Ryals the
Quintal, or hundred weight, and at eight, when they pay for it in Stuffes, or some slight
Commodities made of Iron, as Snuffers, Hinges, &c. made in Europe.
               There is in the Kingdom of Cuncam a certain people called Venesars,Venesars a people of Decam. who buy the

Wheat and Rice, which is brought to the Market, in Cities, once a week, and sell it again
in the Country of Indosthan, and the other neighbouring Provinces, into which they go
with Caffilas, or Caravans, of five or six, and sometimes nine hundred or a thousand Beasts
loaden; with which they carry their Families, especially their Wives, who are as expert at
their Bows and Arrows as the Men, and by that means becomes dreadful to the Rasboutes,
who never durst set upon them, nor yet the Couliers, who exercise their robberies on all
without any distinction, upon this encouragement, that the Rajas, who should punish them,
protect and connive at them.
               There are two sorts of money in the Kingdom of Cuncam,The money of Decam. to wit, the Larims, or Laris,
which come from Persia, and the Pagodes. Eight Persian Laris make a Pagode, which is
worth ten Laris of Dabul, They have also a certain small brass Coin, which they call Basaruiques,
nine whereof make a Pise, and eighteen Peyses a Laris. But in regard there is
no City, nay indeed no Village, which hath not some Coin or other peeuliar thereto, it is
impossible to assign the just value thereof. Besides, there is such abundance of counterfeit
money, that though there be no payment made, but in the presence of the Xaraf, or Money-changers,
yet it is a very difficult matter to shun it; for the Changers themselves
thrust in what is not current among that which is, notwithstanding the penalties appointed
by the Laws to be inflicted on those, who either make or put off counterfeit money,
which are very rigorously put in execution.
               They make use of the same weights as they do in the Kingdom of Guzuratta,The weights. save that
twenty Maons of Surat weight makes twenty seven of Cuncam; and the ordinary Maon,
which consists of forty Ceeres, and sixteen Peyses, makes twenty seven pounds; each pound
making two marks. They have a particular weight for the Pepper, which they call Goemy,
and weighs twelve Maons, four Maons make a Quintal or hundred weight, and twenty
make a Candy.
               The King of Cuncam, or Visiapour, is a Tributary of the great Mogul's,The King of Decam tributary to the Mogul. especially ever
since the disorders, which happened under the King Idal-Scach: which were occasion'd
as you shall find in the ensuing relation.
               In the time of Sulthan Ibrahim Schach, the Father of Idal-Schach, there was belonging
to the service of the Master of the Chappel,The History of Chauas-Chan??? or the Kings Musick, a certain Slave, named
Chauas, a person of understanding and courage, of a pleasant humour, and so taking a
Conversation, that the King, who had particular notice of him, begg'd him of his Master,
and preferr'd him, after several other employments, to the oversight of that apartment,
where his Wives and Concubines were lodg'd, But it prov'd his misfortune one day, that
the King calling to him for drink, they gave him of a bottle that smelt of Oyl; upon
which the King commanded him to leave his presence. Yet was not his disgrace so great,
but that the King had yet somewhat of the ancient kindness for him, for he made him
Captain of the Castle-gate, and bestow'd on him the Government of the City; which he
manag'd with so much conduct, that the King being upon his death-bed, and Mustapha-Chan,
his Favourite, refusing to undertake the Regency during the Princes Minority, who
was then but ten years of age, that great and important charge was conferr'd on Chauas,
who had the Dignity of Chan long before.He  Regent of the Kingdom. His Regency, for the space of ten years, had
the approbation of all the people, but Idal-scach, being come to the twentieth year of his
age, began to think it irksome to be under the tuition of a revolted Slave, and openly to
condemn the familiarity of his conversation with the Queen his Mother. He had also
engag'd the State into a very unjust and extreamly destructive War; upon this account,
that he paid yearly to the Mogul's Deputies, the tribute of thirty Millions of Pagodes,
which the King ow'd him, yet afterwards he caus'd them to be robb'd at their return, by
persons set on purpose to do it,Engages the State  war. who brought him back again all the money. The Mogul
Scach Iahan, who was then living, made his complaints thereof at first, as of a disorder,
which Idal-schach was oblig'd in justice to take some course to prevent: but finding himself
abus'd and laugh'd at, he entred Cuncam with an Army of two hundred thousand
fighting men, where he laid siege to the Castle of Perinda, which certain Hollanders, who
had been sent prisoners thither, helpt to maintain for the space of two years, till such time
as a peace was concluded with the Mogul, after the death of Chauas-chan, who was kill'd
as followeth.
               Idal-schach, not able any longer to suffer the extraordinary and unjust power of his
Guardian to be exercised over him,The King implores the assistance of his Grandees against him. as we said before, made his complaints against him to
the Governours of Provinces and places of trust, intreating them to advise and assist him
against the usurpation of Chauas-chan. They met together, and sent a Message to the
Regent; that their King having attain'd an age fit to govern the Kingdom himself, it was
time he return'd into his hands the administration of Affairs; to which end it were fit

he came out of the Castle, and liv'd in the City as the other Grandees of the Kingdom did;
giving him withall to understand, that if he slighted these Remonstrances of theirs, they
should be forc'd to employ some part of the Kingdoms Forces to oblige him thereto. But
Chauas-chan being very unwilling to devest himself of an Authority which he had been
possest of for so many years, and over-confident of the affection of his Creatures, as also
of that of the people, which he had made it his main business to acquire, during the Regency,
by a liberality truly Royal, made no reflection on these Remonstrances, till he found
some of the great Ones, with an Army of thirty thousand men at the City Gates. Being
reduc'd to this extremity, he took a resolution which proved his ruine.
               For,He attempts the life of his Prince. imagining that the people had so great an affection for him, as to proclaim him King,
in case there were no other, he resolv'd to make away the Prince, and to kill him with his
own hands. To that end, and full of this design, he goes out of his Chamber one night,
while the Army was not yet come within five Leagues of the City, and being come to
the door of the Kings Lodgings, the Guards having made no difficulty to let him pass, and
finding it lock'd, contrary to the custom, he would have forc'd it: but the King awaken'd
at the noise, asked who was there. He made answer that it was he, and that he had some
Letters of great consequence to communicate to him, which he had just then received
from some of the chief Commanders of his Army. The King made answer, that it was
an unseasonable time of the night for the reading of Letters, and bid him come again the
next morning, and thereupon immediately getting up, he went to the Mahael, or Queens
Lodgings, to whom he gave an account of the presumptuous demeanour of Chauas-chan,
in coming to his Chamber door ar such an hour. The Queen, who was a Woman of a
solid judgment, made such reflections on his procedure, that it was presently resolv'd, that
they should, with the soonest, make away that pernicious Minister. They employ'd to effect
their design a Meldar, or Gentleman of the Kings Chamber, and one nam'd Chideram,
Grand Faulconer, and Overseer of the Rams and wild Oxen, which the King keeps
for fighting.But is prevented. As soon as it was day, the King presented himself upon his Throne, accompany'd
by those two persons who were to be employ'd in the foresaid execution; and
having sent for Chauas-Chan, he delivered him a seal'd Letter, and said to him; There
Chauas-Chan, look into that Letter, which I have just now receiv'd from the Generas of my
Army, give me an account of the Contents of it. But while Chauas was opening it, in order
to the reading of it, the Meldar run him into the Breast with a Ponyard, but with so
much precipitation, that, not staying to see what effect the Wound he had given him would
have, he went presently along with the King into the Womens Lodgings. Another Gentleman,
who was present at the blow, perceiving the Wound was not mortal, and pretending
a kindness to Chauas, run immediately to him, embrac'd him, ask'd him what might be
the occasion of his disgrace, and making as if he would have taken the Ponyard out of the
Wound, wherein it still stuck, thrust it so much the further in, that he fell to the ground.
The Eunuch, who was with him, got him convey'd to his own house. But the Queen
having notice of what had past, as also of the disorder, wherein the King and the Meldar
had drawn off, commanded Chideram to go and make an end of him. Chauas-Chan seeing
Chideram coming into his Chamber, and imagining he came out of civility to give him a
visit, said to him; Wo is me, Chideram, who is it that hath thus murthered me? But Chideram,
not suffering him to fall into further discourse,And kill'd. made answer, Traytor, 'tis I; with
which word he run upon him and cut off his head. There were present at this daring action
Chauas-chan's Brother, who was Captain of the Castle-gate, three Chirurgeons, two
Captains, friends of Chauas, and some other of his Kindred who were present, yet they
not only made not the least opposition, but suffered themselves to be all tamely kill'd, not
one profferring to avoid that fatal destiny.
               Chauas-Chan had among his Domesticks a certain Caffre, who coming to hear of his
Masters death, run immediately to the Castle, with an intention to dispatch the King; but
he met by the way with about thirty Souldiers, who stop'd him. He made a shift to kill
ten of them with his own hands, and had dispatch'd the rest, had he not been over-power'd
by number, which increas'd as the noise of the attempt spread more and more into the
City. They cat off his head, and hung it up as a Trophey, upon one of the Towers of the
Castle.
               One of Chauas-chans Creatures,His Friends would revenge his death. whose name was Morary, was advanc'd with ten thousand
Horse, within five Leagues of the City of Visapour; in so much that the King fearing
that General might assemble all the Friends of the deceased, caused him to be proclaim'd
a Traitor against his Prince, and set his Head at a certain price. His own Army
seiz'd his person, and receiving intelligence, that another Lord, named Rundelo, was coming
up to the relief of Chauas-chan, and intended to joyn with Morary, they sent him a byway

to the City, whither he came about eight at night. He sent a Message to the King,
proposing, that if his Majesty would pardon him, and bestow on him the Government of
the Brammenes, he would pay him yearly twenty thousand Pagodes; but those Propositions
were rejected, and the King ordered him to have his hands cut off, and his tongue
cut out, and that in that posture he should be led all about the City; but he died by the
way.
               The only Action that had eclips'd the Ministry of Chauas-chan,Chauas's ingratitude towards his Benefactor. was the disgrace of
Mustafa-chan. This Mustafa was he, who of all the Lords about the Court, was most in
credit with Ibrahim Schach, as being the person upon whom he had cast his eye for the
Guardianship of the Prince his Son. But he, unwilling to accept of it, excus'd himself,
and recommended the merit of Chauas-chan, who requited him with the greatest ingratitude
that ever was heard of. Chauas would needs have that Lord to countenance by his
Authority whatever had been done during the time of the Regency, and finding it impossible
to corrupt him, he resolved to dispatch him out of the way, by perswading the King,
that the honest old Man had some design upon his life. The young Prince implicitely
crediting what was told him by his Favourite, resolved to secure his person, which oblig'd
Mustafa-chan, who had notice thereof, to stand upon his guard, and to fortifie himself in his
house, having about him 700. Horse, and 2000. Foot. The place was regularly besieg'd
with ten Guns; and after he had held out six dayes, he was forc'd to render it and himself
up at mercy; for most of his people, nay his very menial servants fell off from him. Idal-Schach
hearing that Chauas-chan intended either to put Mustafa-chan to death, or at least
to have his eyes out, prevented both, by representing to him, that the Mogul, to whom he
was ally'd, would concern himself in the Fortunes of Mustafa-chan; and upon these considerations,
he was sent prisoner to the Castle of Bellagam-Chapour, being allow'd of all his
vast Revenues, but five Pagodes to live upon.
               Accordingly the Mogul,The Mogul concerns himself in Mustafa's Fortunes. Schach-Iahan had no sooner intelligence brought him of the
disgrace of Mustafa-chan, but he sent an Envoy to Idal-Schach, to require, that he might
be set at liberty, and put into possession of all his estate, or that he should be oblig'd to declare
a War against him. Idal-Schach promis'd to do both, but Chaurs-chan eluded the
performance of that promise, so that Mustafa got not out of prison, till after Chauas his
death: upon which, he was restored to his former dignity, enjoying near ten millions of
Pagodes of yearly revenue. He kept ordinarily a thousand Domesticks, and three thousand
Horse at his own charge abroad, besides those he maintained at his own Palace. Chideram-chan,
who had been very instrumental in the death of Chauas-chan, was next in
credit to Mustafa; and next to him, Agu-rasa, who was Governour General of the Castles
of Ponda, Perinda, Salpour and Bellegam-chapour. He was one of Chauas-chan's Creatures:
whence it came, that upon the death of his Patron, he was not so much in favour
as he had been, but was continu'd in his employments, though he desir'd to be disburthen'd
of the care of publick Affairs by reason of his age.
               They say,The King of Decam able to raise 200000. men. the King of Cuncam is able in a short time to raise two hundred thousand
Men; yet, as we said before, he is a Tributary to the Mogul. Adelham-Schach, great
Grand-father of Idal-Schach, in the year 1586. took the City of Goa twice from the Portuguez:
but considering at last, that War destroyed his Countrey, he treated with them,
and by the Treaty concluded between them, he lest them the Countrey of Salsette, with
67. Villages, that of Bardes, with 12. and that of Tisuary with 30. Villages, provided that
the Inhabitants of Cuncam should enjoy freedom of Commerce all over the Indies; yet
with this further proviso, that they should be oblig'd to sell all their Pepper to the Merchants
of Goa, who had made a general Treaty to that purpose, upon pain of Confiscation.
But this Treaty hath not been so well observed, but that there were, on both sides, from
time to time great dissatisfactions, which by an unhappy accident broke forth into something
of Hostility in the year 1635. For, upon intelligence brought to the Portuguez,
that four of the Kings Ships, bound for Meca, and some parts of Persia, were partly loaden
with Pepper, they sent four Frigots to Sea after them, which set upon the Kings Ships,
and after a vigorous resistance, wherein a Portuguez Captain was kill'd, took them, and
having brought them to Goa, kill'd in cold bloud all the Indians that were aboard; so that
it was not questioned, but that the King of Cuncam would declare War against the City
of Goa.
               There is not any Prince in all those parts so well stor'd with Artillery as the King of
Cuncam.His Artillery. Among others, he had one Brass piece, which requir'd a Bullet weighing eight hundred
weight, with five hundred and forty pound of fine Powder; which did such execution,
as was reported, that at the siege of the Castle of Salapour, at the first firing, it made a
breach in the wall of forty five foot in length. The Caster of it was a Roman born, and

the most wicked of mankind; since he had the inhumanity in cold bloud, to kill his
own Son, to consecrate that monstrous Piece with his bloud, and to cast into the Fire,
wherein he had melted his Metal, one of the Kings Treasures, who would call him
to account for the charge he had been at therein. But it is time we prosecute our
Voyage.
               Ian. 7. We came betimes in the morning before the City of Bacim.Bacim. Being come near
the City, the Portuguez Governour gave us seven Pieces, and we answer'd his civility with
three. We stay'd there above four hours expecting a Portuguez Jesuit, whom we had promis'd
to carry to Goa; but finding he came not within the time he had promised, we kept
on our course. Being got about a League thence, we perceiv'd coming out of the Port a
Portuguez Frigot, which, as we imagin'd, came to bring the Jesuit aboard us; whereupon
we struck some of our sail, to expect it: but the Captain told us, that it was the Governours
desire to the President, that that Frigot might go to Goa under the English Colours,
as fearing to meet some of the Dutch, who incessantly rove up and down that Coast. He
brought us, as a Present from the Governour, three Oxen, some Sheep, Bread, several Baskets
of Citrons and Oranges, and divers other refreshments, wherewith we merrily pursu'd
our Voyage.
               Wednesday, Ian. 9. with a good North-wind, we pass'd by the Isles of Bandera
and Bambay, which reach all along the Coast, from Bacim, as far as Rasiapour. That
of Bambay is of a considerable bigness, and hath a very good Haven towards the Continent.
               Ian. 10. We pass'd in sight of Rasiapour,Rasiapour. which is but 21. Leagues from Goa. In the
afternoon we pass'd by the City of Fingerla, within four Leagues of Goa, where the Hollanders
have a Factory; and in the evening we discover'd the Isles about Goa, and afterwards
the two Castles which secure the entrance of that noble City.
               Ian. 11. We cast Anchor under the Castle Deguard,Come to Goa. about a quarter of a League from
the City. We found in the Haven six Gallions and a Carrack, whom we saluted with our
great Guns. The Mary fir'd twenty five, the other nine, and the third five. The General
of the Gallions gave us a volley of his greatest pieces. The Castle fir'd three; we, in answer
thereto, five; the other two, eight between them. Immediately after, came aboard
us a Portuguez Captain to complement the President from the Viceroy. Not long after,
came the General of the Gallions aboard us in person, in a Gondole gilt and cover'd with
Scarlet. At his coming into the Ship there were twenty Guns fired. After the first Complements,
he intreated the President to go along with him in his Gondole to the Gallion, to
refresh himself for some hours: But the President excus'd himself, in regard he was then
going to the City, and promis'd, at his return, to give him a visit aboard. The Gallions
were there only to keep the Haven against the twelve Dutch Ships, which pretended to
block up the City of Goa towards the Sea. At our coming thither, they were got off at
some distance, to recover themselves after an Engagement, wherein they had lost two of
their Ships, some few dayes before, which were burnt by the Fire-ships: but the next day
they came up again, and cast Anchor in the Road, to hinder the Carrack from getting out,
while the Frigots and little Vessels, which could go along the Coast, brought thither all
sorts of Provisions and Commodities, so freely, that, one day, I saw coming in a Caravan of
above three hundred Boats, loaden with Pepper, Ginger, Cardamomum, Sugar, Rice, Fruits,
and Conserves.
               The President, who as he went up the River had his Trumpets sounding before him,
went strait to the house of the Fiador de la fasende, who is as it were the Overseer of the
Exchequer, it being with him chiefly, that he was to negotiate the business, which had occasion'd
his calling at Goa. The Fiador was sick in bed, yet did he receive the President
with all civility, and promis'd to do him all the good offices he could expect, from the
friendship they had long before contracted together. Thence the President was carried in
a Palanquin to the Lodgings which were assign'd him:The English President visits the Viceroy. whither as soon as he was come, he
sent to demand audience of the Viceroy, which was immediately granted him. The Viceroy's
Palace lies upon the River, so that we went thither by boat. We found upon the
River-side, many Hidalgos, or Gentlemen, of the Viceroy's retinue, who conducted us into
the Hall, where he was to give the President audience. The Guards, who were all clad-in
the same livery, had taken their Armes, and stood in two files in the Anti-chamber, through
which there was an entrance into the Hall, which was richly furnish'd, and full of the Pictures
of several Princes of Europe. The Viceroy, who was all in black, as were also all
his Courtiers, rose out of his Chair at the Presidents coming in, and sate not down again
till the other was set. All the rest of the Company stood before the Viceroy, some only
of the Gentlemen excepted, who carried us into one of the cross Rooms to entertain us.

The President, having dispatched his business, took leave of the Viceroy, who brought him
to the Hall door, where he stood bare, till we were all got out. The same Gentlemen, who
had receiv'd us at our coming out of the Boat, broughtus back to the River, shewing us,
as we came a long, twelve excellent Horses, sumptuously cover'd and harness'd, which had
been purposely brought thither, that we might take notice of the Viceroy's magnificence.
We saw there also a Biggel, which is a Creature about the bigness, and much of the same
colour as a Renne, but is headed like a Horse, main'd like an Ass, having black and cloven
feet, and upon his head two black horns.
               We had hardly dined, at our return to our Lodging, ere we were tir'd with Visitants.
Most of the Portuguez Lords came to salute the President; and there was no Monastery
but sent its Deputies to complement him. The ten dayes we stay'd at Goa were spent
in reciprocal Visits and continual feasting. One of the noblest Entertainments we had,
was that which was made us the 15. of Ianuary, by a Portuguez Lord, who had been Governour
of Bacim, and was then newly come to the government of Mozambique. Every
course consisted only of four dishes of Meat, but they were so often chang'd, and the Meat
so excellently well dress'd, that I may truly say, I never was at the like. For with the
Meat there was brought such variety of excellent Fruits, that by the continual change and
intermixture of both, the appetite was sharpened and renew'd. But what was most remarkable,
was, that though the Portuguez Ladies are as seldom seen as those of the Muscovites
and Persians, yet this Lord, knowing he could not any way more oblige the English,
then by allowing them the sight of Women, we were serv'd at Table by four handsom
young Maids of Malacca, while he himself was attended by two Pages and an Eunuch. These
Maids brought in the Meat, and fill'd our Wine; and though he himself drunk not any,
yet would he have the English treated after their own way, and drink to what height
they pleas'd. Being risen from Table, he brought us into a spacious Chamber, where he
again press'd us to drink; and when the President was to take leave of him, he presented
him with a noble Coverlet of Watte, a quilted Covering for a Horse, a fair Table, and a rich
Cabinet of Lacque.
               The next day,The Jesuits of Goa treat him. being the 16. we dined at the Profess'd House of the Iesuits, who had
invited us to a sumptuous Feast. There were in this House a hundred and fifty Fathers,
and at least as many Scholars or Students, yet did not that great number near fill that noble
Structure, which was four stories high, and had the pleasantest prospect in the World,
as well towards the Sea, as on the Land side. They first shew'd us all the conveniences of
the House, their Wealth, and the order they observ'd in their Oeconomy. Then they
brought us into a fair arched Hall, as big as an ordinary Church, which was beset with Tables
placed all along the Walls. The Cloath was laid, with the Trenchers, the drinking
Cups, and Earthen pots, and they had brought in Bread and Fruit. In the midst of the
Hall, there was another little square Table, cover'd and furnish'd as the rest; for those who
were to do pennance for their having done any thing contrary to the discipline of the Order.
In the midst of the Entry to this Hall, there was a Pillar, out of which issued a Spout
of water for the washing of their hands. Then they carried us up to the third story, to
another Hall, which was not as large as that below, but so richly furnish'd, as might become
the Appartment of a very noble House, as well in point of Tapistry as other things. The
Table prepared for us was very large, and plac'd in the midst of the Hall, cover'd with a
noble Cloath, beset with Fruit, and Bread, and China dishes, which Persons of Quality in
those parts do prefer before those of Silver.
               The Father Provincial,A feast at the professed house of the Jesuits. having given the President the precedence, sate down by him,
and afterward ordered all our company to be so plac'd, as that, between every two, there
were two Iesuits to entertain and discourse with us; the rest standing behind to wait on
us. The Meat was brought in little dishes of Porcelain, to every man his own dish; and
this for several courses, both of Flesh and Fish, all excellently well dress'd. The desert was
suitable to the rest of the entertainment, and consisted in Tarts, Florentines, Eggs drest after
the Portuguez way, admirably well perfum'd, Marchpains, and Conserves, both dry and
liquid.
               At our rising from Table, they conducted us into several Chambers, where they left us,
to take the ordinary repose, during the greatest heat of the day. There was in every
Chamber three Beds, and in the midst upon a Table a great Vessel of Porcelane, full of fair
Water. Then they came and carried us into a Hall, where we were to have the divertisement
of a Ball, which was danc'd by the Children of certain Indians, whom they had baptiz'd
and instructed in the Roman Catholick Religion. The Arch-bishop of Goa, who
was Primate of all the Indies, was there also in person, as well to participate of the divertisment,
as to entertain the President, by order from the Viceroy. The Dancing-master

made the first entrance alone, and did pretty well for a Portuguez: The Habits of the
Dancers were very rich, but they had no Visards on, nor any thing upon their Heads, but
a Crown of Flowers. The noblest entrance, and that which discover'd the subject of
the Ball, was that of fifteen persons who came in, bringing along with them, some pieces
of a broken Pillar, some Garlands of divers Flowers, wherewith they adorn'd the Pillar
after they had, after several turnings, absolutely set it together, all performed with observance
of the Musick. At the upper end of this Pillar came out a Flower, made like a
Tulip, which opened of it self, while they danc'd, till at last there came out of it an Image
of the blessed Virgin, with her Child in her arms, and the Pillar it self opened in several
places, to cast out perfum'd Waters like a Fountain. After they had danc'd a while, they took
the Pillar asunder, after the same manner as they had put it together, and went out of the
Room in very good order. The Iesuits told us, that by that invention they represented
the pains they had taken, in planting among the Pagans and Mahumetans of those parts, the
Church of God, whereof our Saviour is the only Pillar or Corner-stone. After this there
was an entrance of twelve Youths, who sung and play'd every one upon a different Instrument,
all done in exact measure. There came in also some Morris-dancers, who danc'd to the
Castagnets, and kept measure with the Musick so exactly, that I never saw any thing like it.
There came in also one Man alone, who was covered with Birds-nests, and cloath'd and
mask'd according to the Spanish mode, who began the farce of this Comedy, by ridiculous
and fantastick postures, and the Ball was concluded with the coming in of twelve Boys,
dress'd like Apes, which they imitated in their cries and postures. The Ball being over,
we staid there a while to hear their Musick, which was altogether after the Portuguez way.
As we took leave of our Entertainers, they told us, that they made use of those Divertisements,
as well to reduce the Pagans and Mahumetans of those parts to the embracing of
Christian Religion, by that kind of modern Devotion, as to amuse the Children, and divert
them after their studies.
               The 18. of Ianuary,Another Feast at the Jesuits Colledge. we were invited to dinner by the Iesuits of the Colledge, which
they call the Bon-Iesus. We were receiv'd at the entrance by some of the most ancient
Fathers, who shewed us in several Halls and Chambers the Pictures of several Princes and
Persons of Quality, who had been of their Order; as also the Histories of those of their Society,
who had suffer'd Martyrdom for Christian Religion; among whom the Authors of
the Gun-powder plot in England were not the least. But they forbore giving us the Explication
thereof; only they entertain'd us with a long relation of the cruelties, exercis'd
some years before, upon those of their Society in Iapan, where the Emperour had made use
of the most exquisite torments could be invented, upon the Christians, as well the Forreigners,
who had spent their endeavours in planting Religion in those parts, as upon the Iaponneses
who had made profession thereof.
               Having shew'd us whatever was worth the seeing in their Colledge, they brought us
unto the Church, which is no question one of the most sumptuous the Iesuits have in all
Asia. The Structure is vast and magnificent, and the Ornaments are so sutable to the
greatness thereof, that it were not easie to imagine any thing more noble. The first thing
we were shewed was the High-Altar; but though it were one of the noblest I ever saw,
yet came it not, in wealth, near another lesser one, which had been built in honour of
Saint Francis Xavier, whom they call the Apostle of the Indies. We were shewed his
Image, which was upon wood, drawn according to the life, and we were told his body
was still to be seen in that Church, in the same posture as it was at the time of his departure.
               The Iesuits told us, that the body of the said Saint Francis Xavier was found in the
Island of Ceylon, and that it was discovered only by a most delightful smell, which had
brought those who found it many Leagues distance from the Sea, to the place where it was
hidden. Which story does not agree very well with what others write of the same body.
For besides, that the scent which is carried from the Island of Ceylon so far into the
Sea, proceeds from the Groe of Cinnamon, wherewith that Island is in a manner covered.
Maphaeus,The Sepulchro of Francis Xavier. one of the gravest Authors that ever were of the Society, sayes in express terms,
that Francis Xavier, not satisfied with the progress he had made in the Indies by the
means of his preaching the Faith of Christ, would needs try whether it might have the
like success in China: but that he died on the Sea-side, as soon as he landed. Whereto
he adds, that the Master of the Ship, which had carried him thither, caused the Corps
to be put into unslak'd Lime, to the end he might carry away the bones, after the flesh
had been consumed; but that after certain dayes, that consuming matter had not
made any impression upon it, and that the body, instead of being corrupted, smell'd very
sweetly; and that thereupon they resolv'd to carry it to Goa, where it was received

with great Ceremonies. They related to us a great many Miracles wrought by that Saint;
but I remember only two or three of the most considerable; to wit, that he had caused the
Sun to come back an hour after it was set; that he commanded the Sea and the Winds
with the same power, as our Saviour had sometimes done; and that he had rais'd up two
Men, one whereof had been buried a whole day before.
               Out of the Church they brought us into their Refectory, where the Tables were
placed all along the walls, as we had seen them in the Professed House, and in so great a
number, that there was room enough for two hundred persons. Yet were there only four
of the chiefest among them that dined with us, while all the rest stood and waited on us.
We were as well treated by these as we had been by the others: but I must confess these
gave us the best Canary that ever I drunk. Of all the Moral Vertues, there is not any the
Iesuits endeavour more to practise then Sobriety, in so much that Drunkenness is a Vice
they can the least of any be charged withall; and yet at this time they often call'd to
drink, I conceive, purposely to engage us, to make it appear that it was not out of pure
Complement we commended their Wine. After dinner, they carried us up into the Steeple,
whence we could take a view of all the City, the Sea, the River, and all the adjacent
Champion, as far as the Mountain, much better then we could have done from the fourth
Story of the Professed House.
               As we took leave of them,The Hospital of Goa. they promised to send two of their Fathers to our Lodgings
the next morning, who should shew us the great Hospital, whereof the Iesuits have the
oversight. It is a very noble Structure, consisting of Chambers, Halls and Galleries, able
to lodge above a thousand sick persons, who are very carefully supplyed with all things.
Every Bed is mark'd with a certain Figure; and those which are not taken up, are known
by their mark, which is standing upright; whereas those which are, have the mark in some
other posture. The noblest Appartments of the Hospital were the Kitchin and the Apothecaries
shop belonging to it, both well furnished with all things necessary for the accommodation
of the sick, whereof there were a very great number; but most of the Pox, or
Bloudy-flux. Those who are to look after them have this foresight, that they would not
have the sick to be disheartened by seeing others dye; for as soon as they perceive the sick
party so far spent as that there is no way but death for him, he is carried to a private room,
whither a Priest is sent to him, who stirs not thence till he be dead.
               Having view'd the Hospital,The Monastery of the Augustines we went to see the Monastery of the Augustines, which
they call the Convent of our Lady of Grace. It is seated upon a little eminency, so that,
seeing it at a certain distance, a man would take it for one of the noblest Palaces in the
World. The Friers carried us all about it, and shewed us particularly the rich Copes and
other Priests Vestments, which they said were given them by Persons of Quality, who had
spent some time among them. I deliver'd them the Letters of recommendation, which
the Augustines at Ispahan had given me, directed to them: whence it came that their civilities
towards me were extraordinary. They proffer'd to shew me what was most remarkable
about the City; but in regard I had already seen as much as I desir'd, I thank'd them,
and came away with the rest of the company.
               As soon as the President had dispatch'd his business with the Viceroy, who paid him
nine thousand pounds sterling, in ready Money, and promis'd him the rest should be paid,
either in Money, or Commodities, to those English Merchants, whom, to that purpose, he
had brought from Surat, he return'd their civilities, of whom he had received any, and
took leave of all.The Viceroy's Presents to the President. The Viceroy, the General of the Gallions, and all the principal Lords
about the Court, sent him very considerable Presents. The former presented him with
several Skins of Cinnamon, a Biggel, some Butts of Sack, Sheep, and certain Baskets of
Fruit, and other refreshments. The Iesuits sent him Aqua vitae, and good store of all
sorts of Conserves, dry and liquid, with an intreaty, that he would take along with him,
for England, certain Iesuits, and among the rest, one who had liv'd long enough in China
to be throughly acquainted with the Country. Of all the Presents that were sent him,
what the President esteemed most, was a Bottle of Oyl, which had been extracted out of
the Flower of Cinnamon, and a Candle made of the Oyl extracted out of Cinnamon it
self.
               Ian. 20. We left Goa,Mande lo leaes Goa. and met upon the River with above a hundred small Vessels,
loaden with all sorts of Provisions and Commodities, which came from Cananor, and the
Coasts of Malabar, and had passed, notwithstanding the Block-house of Dutch Vessels,
which could only hinder the Gallions and Carracks from getting thence, to go for Portugal,
or towards the Moluccas. As soon as we were got out of the River, we made strait to
the Generals Gallion, which was called the Bon-Iesus, and carried sixty four Brass Guns, all
Cannons or Culverings. There were aboard her six hundred Men, Mariners and Souldiers;

and it was one of the noblest Vessels I ever saw. The General receiv'd the President
with much civility, and brought him into his Chamber, in and about which were an
Anti-chamber, a Closet, and two Galleries: and after a Collation of Conserves and Sack,
contrary to the custom of the Portuguez, who never proffer a Man drink, unless he ask for
it, he shew'd us all the Ship, which had the name of a Gallion, but might very well be accounted
a Carrack by reason of the bigness of it. The other Vessels of the Fleet were
also very noble ones, there being not any one among them, that had not fifty Guns at least.
The General and President were in private discourse, for about half an hour, after which
the President took his leave, and the General conducted him to a door which was in the
Stern of the Ship, at which it was more commodious getting out, then it is in other Ships
by Ladders of Ropes. As soon as the President was got into the Boat, all the Portuguez
Fleet fir'd their Guns. The Governour of the Castle de Guarde, having saluted the President,
who was his intimate Friend, with all the Guns he had, presented himself
upon the Battery, put off his Hat, and took leave of us. The President being come
aboard, ordered twenty Guns to be fired, which the General answered with twenty
others; whereupon we went into the Road, and lay between the Portuguez and Dutch
Fleets.
               But,Goa described. ere we leave Goa, it will not be amiss, to give yet a little further account of what
we found most remarkable in that City, which no doubt is one of the noblest and greatest
of those the Portuguez are Masters of in any part of the Indies. It lies in the Kingdom
of Cuncam, or Decam, fifteen Degrees on this side the Line, in an Island, which the River
divides from the Continent. Alfonso Albuquerque took it by Composition, on the 16. of
February, 1510. from Zabaim Dalcam, Prince of Goa, who recovered it again from him
on the 30th of May following; but on the 21. of November in the same year, Albuquerque
receiving fresh Forces irom a Fleet, which Diego Mendez Vaseoncelos had then newly
brought from Portugal, set upon the City and took it by storm. The City of Goa was,
even at that time, very considerable for its Traffick, but much less then it is now, as may be
seen by the Walls of the old City, which are yet standing, though the Gates be down, in
so much that there is nothing between it and the new City, built by the Portuguez, since
they established their main Trade there. It hath on the South-side the Island of Salsette,
which is divided from the Continent only by a small Rivulet, as is also the Island of Bardes,
which lies on the North-side, and under which Ships may cast Anchor with all safety,
without fear of any Winds. The Castle de Guarde lies at the foot of a Rock, on which
they have built a Tower, in form of a Redoubt, wherein, in the night time they make a
Fire, for a direction to Ships, and it hath several Brass pieces placed even with the Water.
From the mouth of the River to the Haven are about two Leagues, but it is equally
broad all along, even at the place where it runs between the Island and the Continent,
though in some places it be so shallow, that in Summer time there is not above two foot
water.
               The Island of Goa does not produce any thing, and is so barren, that some few Lambs
and Goats excepted, it is not able to sustain any thing; and yet the Portuguez have some
Gardens there, and in them some Fruit, but it is to be attributed rather to their industry,
then to Nature. Palm-wine is there in abundance, and all other provisions are brought
thither from the two forementioned Islands, or from the Continent, so plentifully, that
they are so cheap there, that notwithstanding the Block-house of the Hollanders, a Hog
might be had for a Crown, six sucking Pigs, ten Pullets, or eight wild Ducks, for as much;
but there are very few Oxen there, then which Sheep are yet more scarce. They permit
not the Indians to go over into the Continent, without leave obtain'd from those who
keep the passages, who make a mark in their Armes, which they are oblig'd to shew as they
come back: for the Portuguez would not have the Decanines and Canarines come into
the City without a Pass-port. All the fresh-water they have within the City comes
from a Fountain, which represents a Lucrece, out of whose Wound there comes Water
enough to supply the whole City: but the Ships take in fresh-water near the Castle,
above which there comes out of the Rock a Rivulet, which there falls into the
River.
               The City hath now neither Gates nor Walls,Goa hath no wll. but the River, which makes the Island,
secures it against the attempts, which an open place might be exposed to. The publick
Buildings are very fair, and the Palaces of great Persons very magnificent, especially in
their Houshold-stuffe.
               The Inhabitants are either Castizes, that is, Portuguez, born of Father and Mother Portuguez;
                     
                  
or Most zes, that is, born of a Portuguez Father, and Indian Mother. The Mestizes
are distinguished from the others by their colour, which inclines towards the Olive;

but those of the third Generation are as black as the Inhabitants of the Country; which
happens also in the fourth Generation of the Castizes, though there were no mixture among
them. The Portuguez are either Titulados, as those who are employed in the principal
charges; Fidalgos da casa del Rey, that is, Gentlemen in ordinary of the Kings
House; Mocos Fidalgos, young Gentlemen, that is, the Sons of Titulados, or Cavalleros, or
newly admitted to Gentility by the King, Cavalleros Fidalgos, Escuderes Fidalgos, or
simply Gentlemen. There are also such as have the quality of Mocos da camra, or Grooms
of the Kings Chamber, who pass also for Gentlemen. All the rest are Hombres, Honrados,
and Soldados. The former are Merchants or Tradesmen, and appear publickly with the
same gravity, and almost with the same retinue as Gentlemen; in as much as, some only
excepted, who cut Leather for Shooes, and Stuffes for Clothes, all the rest have their business
done by Slaves.
               No Person of Quality goes abroad afoot; for some are carried by their Slaves in a Palanquin,
and others ride on Horseback, or go in painted and gilty Gondoles; but not any
without a Slave to carry an Umblello, or Fan.
               The Portuguez have the reputation of being very highly conceited of themselves;The Portuguez of Goa pruder then any other. but
those of Goa are such in so high a degree, as well in their gate, as all their other actions,
that they treat, as unacquainted with the World, such as are newly come from Portugal,
and are not accustom'd to their manner of going and life. They are excessively civil one
to another; nay, they are, in this, so ceremonious and exact, that he who should omit to
render a person, that gives him a visit, the honour he conceives due to himself, whether it
be in making him sit down otherwise then he would, or not bringing him to the street-door,
must expect the effects of a deep resentment, whereof the least are cudgelling or caning,
which they liberally bestow on persons of mean condition, who being below them,
have omitted giving them the respect they look for from those that are not their Equals,
though indeed they owe them not any.
               Winter begins there towards the end of Iune,Winter begins in June. with a South-west Wind, which comes
from the Sea, and reigns for the space of four moneths, all along that Coast, from Diu, as
far as the Cape of Comory; and during all that time, the Sea is not only innavigable, but
there are few Havens, where Ships can ride in safety, and unexpos'd to Storms, mixt with
terrible Thunder and Lightning, which disturb the Air there in that season. Which is
yet so much the more to be wondred at, inasmuch as, at the same time, the Coast of Coromandel,
which is in the same Peninsula, and at the same degree of elevation, and in some
places is but twenty Leagues distant from that of Malabar, enjoyes a pleasant Spring, and
the most divertive season of the year. Accordingly, those who go from Cochim to Saint
Thome, by land, as they pass over the Mountain of Balagatta, which divides the whole
Peninsula, as the Apennine does Italy, discover, from the top of the Mountain, on the one
side, a clear and temperate Air, and on the other, a Country cover'd with a perpetual mist,
and drown'd with the Rains that continually fall. The same observation may be also
made in those Ships, which go from Ormus to the Cape of Rosalgate. Where, as they pass
the Cape, they suddenly pass out of fair Weather, into dreadful Storms and Tempests.
Whence it comes that, in those parts, there are but two Seasons, as there are also principally
but two Winds that reign there in the Summer time, to wit, those of the East, which the
Portuguez call Therentos, which come from the Land-side, and blow from mid-night till
mid-day; but they are not felt above ten Leagues within the Sea; and those of the West,
which they call Virasons, which come from the Sea, immediately after dinner, and blow all
the rest of the day.
               This change of Seasons from one extremity to another is the cause of many Diseases
among the Portuguez;The Diseases of those parts. but the most common there are those which they call Mordexin,
which kills immediately, burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, against which they have in a
manner no remedy but bleeding. The Plague is a Disease not known in the Indies; but,
o make amends, they have the Pox, which destroyes every year a great number of Portuguez.
For, though the Country produces present and topical Remedies against the Disease,
yet so violent are their inclinations to Women, who, on the other side, are as mad for
Men, that they will not take the time to be cur'd of a Disease, which is not got off by Remedies,
if they be not accompany'd with a very regular diet. The Women of those parts
ave an excessive affection for white Men, and, being kept very much in restraint, they are
put to all imaginable inventions, to let them know how passionately they love them, and
o get them into their Lodgings: where they many times prosecute their delights, even in
he Husbands presence, by means of a Drug, which so stupifies his Senses, as that he seems
ither to have lost them, or to sleep with his eyes open.
               The Indians call this Herb Doutro, Doutry, or Datura, and the Turks and Persians Daula.

Garcias ab horto, and Christopher d' Acosta, affirm, that it is a kind of Stramonea; that the
Herb grows abundantly all over the Indies, in the shade, and that it is somewhat like Bearsfoot.
They extract the juyce of it, while it is green, or they beat the Seed to powder, and
mix it in Conserves, or put it into his drink, whom they would reduce to that condition
for twenty four hours: during which time he is depriv'd the use of all his Senses, so that
he does not see what is done before him, though his eyes be open, unless some body moisten
the soles of his seet with fair water, which revives and recovers him, much after the same
manner as if he awoke out of a sound sleep.
               There are few Portuguez Women, or Mestizes, seen going about the City; and when
they go abroad,The Women go abroad. either to Church, or upon necessary Visits, they are carried in close Palanquins,
or are attended and watch'd by so many Slaves, that it is impossible to speak to them.
When they appear in publick, they are all very richly attir'd, in Velvet, Flower'd-Sattin, or
Brocado, and adorn'd with abundance of Pearls and precious Stones; but at home, they
go in their Hair, and have about them only a Smock, which reaches to the Navil; and
thence downwards, they have Petticoats of painted Clothes falling down to the Feet,
which are bare. They eat no Bread, as liking the Rice better, now that they are accustomed
to it; nor do they fare over-deliciously as to other things, their ordinary sustenance being
Salt-fish, Mangas, or only Rice, soak'd in a little Flesh or Fish-broath. They make use
of certain Bottles, made of a kind of black Earth, which they call Gorgolettes, and have a
Pipe coming up to the brims, so as that they may suck up the Water without lifting up the
Bottles to their mouths.
               The Men there are so jealous of their Wives,The jealousie of the Portuguez that they permit not their nearest Relations
to see them: for Chastity is so strange a Vertue in those parts, that there is no Woman
but contrives all the wayes imaginable to pursue her enjoyments, never minding the
breach of those Laws which God and Nature hath imposed upon them, though the frequent
misfortunes which happen upon that occasion should engage them to be more cautious
and reserv'd. The perpetual idle life they lead makes them so high in their desires,
for they do not any thing of business in the world, but spend the day in chewing of Bettele,
which adds fuel to the flames of their lewd inclinations, as do also the Cloves and Nutmegs,
which they eat, out of an imagination that they prevent the corruptions of the Teeth
and Stomack, which commonly make the Breath stink.
               The Indian Women, who conceive by an European, have so great an affection for their
Children, that they would rather dye then part with them. Children are not cloath'd till
they are of age to wear Breeches: and till that time they are brought up by Slaves, or
other Indian Women.
               The Souldiers live after another rate among them.The Portuguez Souldiers. For those who go in that quality
from Portugal, do not list themselves under any particular Captain, nor will be engaged to
continue in any one certain place to keep Garrison there: but when they come to the Indies,
they do what they please themselves. Accordingly they have no pay, but when
they are in actual service upon the Engagements they are forc'd to at Sea, against the Malabars,
or the Dutch. But the Captains, who have occasion for these people, treat them
with much civility, and give them now and then somewhat towards their subsistence,
that they may be assured of their persons and services, when they have any work for
them: so that they have what to live upon, yet spend not much. For commonly they
live ten or twelve in the same house, where they diet together, having but two or three
Servants among them, and as many Suits of Clothes, for those who go abroad, either
to beg, or upon some design, while the rest stay at home, till their turns come to march
out.
               The Marriages and Christenings of the Portuguez are celebrated with very great magnificence.Their Marriages and Christnings.
The Friends and Relations come on horseback to the Bridegrooms door, and
thence march before him to Church, into which he enters, accompanied by two of his
Friends, who are instead of God-fathers to him; and the Bride follows him in a Palanquin,
accompanied also by her two God-fathers. After the benediction of the marriage, they
reconduct the new married couple to their house, into which only the God-fathers enter
with the young couple, who go into a Balcony, or stand at a Window, to give the company
thanks, which in the mean time shew a thousand tricks in the Street. Their Chistenings
are performed, in a manner, with the same Ceremonies, save that, at these there is carried
an Ewer with a clean Napkin, a Salt-sellar, and in the midst a Silver Basin, in a heap of Roses,
or other Flowers, a Wax-candle, into which they put a piece of Gold or Silver, for an
Offering to the Priest. The God-father, and the Mid-wife, are carried with the Child in
Palanquins.
               Most of the Portuguez have many Slaves of both Sexes,Their Slaves. whom they employ not only

about their persons, but also upon any other business they are capable of; for what they
get comes in to the Master. Whence it comes that handsome Wenches are sought after,
to be imploy'd in the selling of Fruits, and such Commodities as the Portuguez send to
market; to the end their beauty might draw in Customers, and so they by a double way
of trading, bring in double profit to their Masters. Their keeping, as to diet, stands them
in very little; and all the cloathing they give them is only as much Linnen-cloath as will
cover the privy parts. The Children born between Slaves belong to the Master, unless
the Father will redeem them, within eight or ten dayes after they are born; which if they
let slip, they are not afterwards admitted to do it, and the Master disposes of them; and
when they are able to do any thing, makes use of them himself, or sells them in the Market,
as we do Cattle.
               The Inhabitants of the Country are Pagans,The Inhabitants of the Country, and their houses. and for the most part Benjans. Their Houses
are all of Straw, and very little, having no light but what comes in at a little low door.
All their Houshold-stuffe consists principally in certain Mats made of Rushes, which serve
them both for their lodging at night, and to lye down upon at meals. Their Dishes,
Drinking-cups, and Napkins, are made of Fig-leaves, of which they also make Pitchers
and Oyl-pots, and their ordinary sustenance is Rice, which they boyl in Earthen pots.
They daub over their Houses with Cow-dung, out of an imagination that it drives away
Fleas.
               They are so superstitious, that they never go abroad till they have said their prayers; and
if they chance to meet a Crow, where-ever they be, they immediately return home, and
undertake no business of any consequence that day. When they travel, they do their devotions
before their Pagodes; and the Portuguez tollerate their Idolatry, upon this account,
that the Inquisition hath no power, but only over such as either are Christians, or have
been such. They have also their particular ceremonies for their Marriages, their birthdayes,
and other dayes, and seasons of the year: but they differ so little from those whereof
we have spoken already, that we shall need say nothing of them. There are among
them some very able Physitians, who are so highly respected at Goa, that they are permitted
to have their Umbrellos carried with them; which is a Priviledge allowed only
persons of quality: nay the Portuguez, even to the Vice-Roy himself and the Arch-Bishop,
make use of them, rather then of those of their own Nation. They never eat but with
those of their own Sect, though they were ready to starve. Nay, in this particular they
are so scrupulous, that if, in their journey to Cochim, their provision should fall short, they
would rather starve, then be oblig'd to eat what another had sown or made ready. Most
of the Porters about Goa are Christians, as are also their Money-changes, whom they call
Xaraffes, who make an external profession of Christianity, but, in their dealing, are Iews,
apt to over-reach and deceive all that have to do with them. There are in Goa many Decanins
and Canarins, who have Shops there, and buy of the Portuguez, Porcelane, Velvet
Damask, and other Stuffes of Silk and Cotton, as also some China Commodities, all by
whole sale, and afterwards sell them again by retail. These also bring Provisions from the
Continent, and trade therein, having to that end their Brokers and Factors, who mannage
their business,The Decanins excellent Gravers, &c. while they go to Cambaya, and along the Coast to improve their Traffick.
There are amongst them Goldsmiths, Jewellers, Gravers, and other Artizans, who do things
incomparably better then any of ours. These also farm the Kings Demesne in the Islands
of Bardes and Salsette; upon which account, having sometimes occasion to go to Law, they
are so well vers'd in the Laws and Customs of Portugal, that they need no Advocates to
plead their Causes.
               Most of the Canarins are either Husband-men, or Fisher-men. There are some of them
have no other employment then dressing the Cocos-trees, to get the Wine and Fruit they
produce. Others only wash Linnen, or whiten Cloath. The Peasants bring in every day
to the City,Their women delivered wihout pain. wild Fowl, Milk, Fruit, Eggs, and other provisions to be sold. Their Wives
are deliver'd with the greatest easiness imaginable. They make no use of Midwives, but
are deliver'd alone, wash their Children themselves as soon as they are born, put them under
a few Fig leaves, and return to their work, as if they had not been about any such
thing.They live in perfect health to 100. years of age. The Children brought up after this rate, grow so hardy and strong, that it is an
ordinary thing to see Men among them of a hundred years of age, yet have not a Tooth
missing, but all the time in perfect health. They are all excellent Swimmers, whence it
comes, that they venture over to the Continent in their little Boats called Almadis,
which indeed are so little, that they can hardly carry one person: in so much that
they are frequently overturn'd, but they recover them again by swimming, cast out the
Water, and prosecute their Voyage. Though in these parts they burn the dead bodies
instead of burying of them, yet are not the Women oblig'd to burn themselves with

their Husbands Corps, but only to cut off their Hair, and make a Vow of perpetual Widowhood.
               The Iews,The Jews of Goa. who live at Goa, have there their Temples and Synagogues, and enjoy an
absolute liberty of Conscience. They are either Indians born of, Father and Mother,
Iews, or they come out of Palastine; these last, for the most part, speak the Spanish
tongue.
               The Mahumetans, who live there, trade for the most part to Meca, and other places upon
the Red-sea, whither they carry Spices. The Portuguez and the Mestizes have their
greatest Trade in Bengala, Pegu, Malacca, China, and in Guzuratta, at the City of Cambaya.
No Person of Quality at Goa, but goes once a day to the Market, whither the Merchants,
nay, most Gentlemen come, as well to hear what news there is, as to see what there is to be
sold; for, from seven in the morning to nine, (after which the heat is such, as that a Man
is not able to stay there) the publick Criers, whom they call Laylon, sell there by outcry,
all sorts of Commodities, but especially Slaves of both Sexes, and Jewels. There you
shall see the Crier loaden with Chains, Gold Rings, and precious Stones, and followed by a
great number of Slaves, all to be sold. There are also to be sold there, Persian and Arabian
Horses, Spices, all sorts of Aromatick Gums, Alcatifs, Porcelane, Vessels of Agat, several
things made of Lacque, and whatever is thought precious or rare in any other part of
the Indies. Merchants and Tradesmen are distinguished by Streets; so that Silk-men are
not shuffled in among Linnen-Drapers; nor the Druggists among those who sell Porcelane.
The greatest profit they make is in the exchange of Money. For when the Spanish
Fleet comes in, they buy Ryals at ten or twelve in the hundred loss; and in April, when
the Ships go away for the Molucca's and China, where the Ryals are much esteem'd, they
fell them again at twenty five or thirty in the hundred profit, notwithstanding the Order
there is to sell them at four hundred Reis. They make the same advantage by the change
of the Laris, which they also sell at ten or twelve in the hundred profit.
               They have several sorts of money.Their money. The least is that which hey call Basarucques, which
on the one side have a Globe, on the other two Arrows cross'd. They are made of Tin
and Lattin mixt together, and eight of these Basarucques make a Ventin, whereof five make
a Tanghe. Five Tanghes make a Serafin of Silver, which, according to the King. Command,
is set at three hundred Reis, and six Tanghes make a Pardai. The Serafin hath on
the one side Saint Sebastian, on the other a sheaf of Arrows. There are also Serafins of
Gold, coined heretofore at Ormus, of a more refin'd metal then any other Moneys of the
Indies; whence it comes, that the Gold-smiths melt down all that fall into their hands of
them. They have also Santemes of 16. Tanghes, and Pagodes of 14??? 15. and 16.
Tanghes.
               Forreign Merchants pay at their coming in eight in the hundred for all Merchandises,Customes upon Forreign Commodities.
and as much at their going out; but the Farmers of the Customs are so reasonable in their
valuing of them, that the Merchants have no cause to complain. They have also this
favour, that if a Merchant hath paid the Customs at his coming in, and hath not put
off his Commodities, he may carry them to some other place, without paying ought
at the Exportation. In like manner, a forreign Merchant that hath bought of a
Portuguez, or other Citizen of Goa, Spices, or any other Commodities of Malacca or
China, may enter them under the Sellers name, and so avoid paying the Customes due at
exportation.
               The Viceroy at the time of our being there,The Viceroy of Goa. was D. Pedro de Silva. His person was
not answerable to his quality, but he had about him above fifty Gentlemen, who gave him
the same respect as they could have done the King himself. This charge is continued in
the same person, but for three years, as well in regard it were dangerous, a Subject should
longer be possess'd of a Dignity, which differs from the Soveraign only in time; as that
the King of Spain hath many Lords to gratifie with an Employment, which enriches them
sufficiently in that time. For, besides that his whole Court lies at the Kings charge, he
hath the disposal of all his Revenue, and every year makes a Visit for sixty or eighty Leagues
about, which is worth to him very much. But the Presents which the neighbouring Princes,
and the Governours and under Officers make him, are not to be valued. He hath his
Council of State, and his Courts of Law and Equity. He is absolute Judge in all civil
Causes, the most important only excepted, wherein there may appeal be made to the King.
Criminal Sentences are executed there, notwithstanding the Appeal; but it is not in the
Viceroy's power to indict a Gentleman, but he is oblig'd to send him, with the Informations
brought in against him, to Portugal, unless the King order some other course to be
taken with him. The Viceroy at his arrival into the Indies, lands in the Island of Bardes,
or some other Haven on that side, whence he immediately sends his Agents to Goa,

to take possession of his charge, and what ever depends on it. His Predecessour makes
way for him, upon the first news he receives of his Arrival, unfurnishes the Palace, and
leaves him only the Guards and the bare walls. Thus much we thought fit to say of the
City of Goa.
               Ianuary 22. about noon,Mandelsc continues his Voyage. the President sent away the two Ships which came along
with us from Surat, and were to carry thither the money which had been received at Goa;
and after he had dismiss'd certain Iesuits, and several other persons of quality of Goa,
who were come to visit him aboard, we hoys'd sail, yet expecting to come aboard our Ship
the General of the Dutch Fleet, whose name was Van Kenlen, who had intreated him to
convey some Letters to his Superiours. But he came not. In the Evening we saw all
the Dutch Fleet under sail, whence we imagin'd that the General intended to give us a visit,
but with the night we lost sight of them, and having a reasonable good wind, kept on
our course.
               Ian. 23. At break of day, we had a sight of the Dutch Fleet again; and then we conceiv'd
they were going to relieve the King of Ceylon, who had intreated the General to
assist him against the Portuguez, who had declar'd war against him. About noon, we were
at thirteen degrees latitude, and out of sight of land. But in regard we intended to go
towards the Coast of Malabar, upon intelligence brought us, that an English Ship, coming
from Bantam, richly loaden with Spices, had been set upon and spoil'd by the Malabar
Pyrates, the next day we chang'd our course, and took it more Eastward, so to get towards
the land. The Malabars had taken their advantage of the condition that Ship was in,
which was so over-burthen'd, that she could make use of but six Guns; they found indeed
no great difficulty to enter her; but they were no sooner in, ere the English sent above
six hundred of them, with the upper Deck into the Sea. They dispatch'd as many with
the second; but afterwards being themselves forc'd to go to the Stern, to avoid the fire,
they yielded to the Malabars, who, with the Ship, took the Captain, the Masters Mate, the
Clark, and fourteen others, whom we intended to redeem.
               About noon we pass'd in sight of Monteleone,Monteleone. a high mountain from which the Malabars
discover, at a distance, the Vessels they conceive they may set upon with advantage, and
at night we came to the Haven of Cananor, where we found three English Vessels, the Dragon,
the Catharine, and the Seymour, commanded by Captain Weddell, one of the most experienced
Sea-Captains of his time, one that had been at the taking of Ormus, and was then
entertain'd into the service of a new Company, erected not long before in England, for the
trade of the Indies. Having fired some Guns to salute the Castle, we sent to Captain Weddell,
to know what condition the English prisoners were in; and hearing they were most
of them set at liberty, we would stay no longer on that Coast.
               The Portuguez have a Garrison in the Castle of Cananor,The Malabars. but the City is inhabited by
Malabars. They call by that name all those people who live upon that Coast from the
City of Goa, as far as the Cape of Comory, or Comorin. The Country is very fertile, and
brings forth abundance of Spices, but particularly the best Pepper in the Indies, which is
most esteem'd, because the grain of it is bigger then it is any where else, even then that
which grows in Sumatra and Iava. The Inhabitants go stark naked, covering only
those parts, which Nature would not have seen even in Beasts. They make holes in the
tips of their Ears, and are black, but have not such great Lips as the Moors of Africk.
They tye up their Hair together upon the Crown of the Head, and let their Beards grow
to the full length, without any ordering or trimming, in so much that they are not unlike
those figures, under which we would represent the Devil. Nor is their disposition
unsuitable to this pleasant external shape, for they understand nothing of civility, nor are
capable of any Commerce or Conversation. They are for the most part Pyrates and
Souldiers, who may be said to have rashness rather then courage, and are expert enough
in the handling of their Armes, which are Sword and Buckler, Bows and Arrows. They
make also a kind of Muskets themselves, and use them with advantage. They obey neither
the King of Cuncam, nor the Viceroy of Goa, but they have their particular King or
Prince, who also performs the functions of High-Priest, and is of the Sect of the Bramans.
These were the most considerable enemies the Portuguez met with, at the beginning
of their establishment in the Indies: but ever since they made a Treaty with them,
they have liv'd in very good correspondence.Zamori Emperour of Calicut and Cananor. Their Prince, whom they call Zamorin, is
also King of Calicuth, upon the same Coast. In the year 1604. the Dutch made a Treaty
with him, for the freedom of Trade; but the Portuguez coming to be more powerful in
those parts, and the Dutch finding it easier to settle themselves in other places, where they
continue their Trade with greater advantage, they have neglected the friendship of these

Barbarians. I observ'd at Cananor, that there were some men among them, who never
par'd their Nails; and that there were others, who wore Bracelets and Rings about their
Armes. These are the Gentry of the Country, whom they call Nayres, that they may be
distinguish'd from Persons of meaner condition, whom they call Polyas. The Nayres are
very proud, and conceited of themselves, and permit not the Polyas so much as to touch
them. They alwayes go with their Sword and Buckler, wherewith they make a noise in
the Streets as they go, and perpetually cry out Po, Po, that people should make way for them.
As soon as they perceive them coming, they close on both sides, look down to the ground,
and do them reverence. Some affirm, that this punctilio of Honour, whereby they pretend
to a respect due to them from all that are not of their race, was one of the things
that most obstructed the Treaty which the Portuguez were ready to conclude with the
King of Cochim, at their first establishment, in regard they would have the Portuguez do
them the same submissions as the Polyas did. The Portuguez, on the other side, who are
as highly conceited of themselves as any Nation in the World, refused to do it; so that to
decide the difference, it was agreed, that a Portuguez and a Nayre should fight for the honour
of the two Nations; upon condition, that the Conquerour should give the Law to
the conquered. The Portuguez Champion had the advantage, and by that means obtain'd
the precedence for his Nation; and ever since that time, the Portuguez have the same honour
done them by the Nayres,The priviledges of the Nayres as they have done them by the Polyas. Many of these
Nayres never marry, in regard they have a certain priviledge to see the Wives and Daughters
of their Camerades, and to that end, to go into their Houses at any time of the day.
When they go into any House upon that score, they leave their Sword and Target at the
Street-door, which mark prohibits entrance to all others whatsoever, nay the very Master
of the House himself, finding those Armes at his Door, passes by, and gives his Camerade
full liberty to do what he please. The Polyas are not so much honourd as to have the
Nayres visit their Wives, who must be content with their own Husbands; for it were a
great crime in a Nayre to defile himself, by conversing with the Wife of a common person.
The Nayres are all Souldiers, made use of by the King, both for his Guard and in his Wrs.
On the contrary, the Polyas are forbidden the bearing of Armes, and so are either Tradesmen,
Husbandmen, or Fishermen.
               The Malabars write with a Bodkin upon the bark of the Cocos-tree,The writing of the Malabars. which they cut
very thin, and in an oblong form like a Table-book, drawing a String through the middle,
which hold the leaves together, and comes twice or thrice about the box or case, which is
as it were a covering to it. Their Characters have nothing common with those of the
other Indians, and are understood only by their Bramans, for most of the common people
can neither write nor read.
               The King of Calicuth doth not eat any thing,The order of succession in Calicuth. which had not been presented before to
his Pagode; and it is to be particularly observed, that in this Kingdom it is not the Kings
Son, but the Kings Sisters Son, who inherits the Crown, it being the common perswasion,
that the Children born of the Queen, are begotten rather by their Bramans then by the
King himself.
               As concerning the City of Cochim,Cochim described. it is to be observed, that there are two Cities of the
same name in the Kingdom of Cochim, one whereof lies upon a great River, and belongs to
the King of Cochim, the other to the Portuguez. This last, whereof we now speak, is
seated upon the same Coast, at ten degrees on this side the Line, having on the West-side
of it the Sea, and on the Land-side a Forrest of black Trees, whereof the Inhabitants of
the Country make their Boats called Almadies. These Trees they make hollow, and so
their Boat is all of one piece, yet with these they make a shift to go along the Coast as far
as Goa. The Port is very dangerous, by reason of the Rocks which make the entrance into
it very difficult.
               At the beginning of Winter, there falls such abundance of Rain in the neighbouring
Mountains, that several Brooks are of a sudden by that means overflown, and run with
such violence, that the Earth which they carry along, and which is stopped by the Waves
that are forc'd by the Wind against the Earth, makes in that place a kind of Bank, which
so stops up the mouth of the Haven, that 'tis impossible to get into it or out of it, during
that time, nor indeed till the Wind, which changes with the season, forces the Sea back
again, which carries along with it the filth which the Rain had left in that place.
               The Portuguez carry on a great Trade in this place in Pepper, which the King of
Cochim sells them at a certain rate, agreed upon with the Viceroy at his first coming
to Goa; but the Inhabitants of the Country, and other Forreigners, pay dearer for
it.
               
               The King of Cochim is one of the most powerful Princes of those parts; it being certain,The power of the King of Cochim A great Priviledge of the Bramans.
that he is able to raise above a hundred thousand men; the most part Nayres, who are
obliged to serve at their own charge, either with Horse or Elephants. As to their manner
of life, it is not fully so brutish as that of the Malabars, but they observe the same Custom,
for the succession of their Kings, and the Consummation of their Marriages, which work
is performed by their Bramans.
               This sort of people is so highly respected amongst them, that the Master of the House
seeing a Braman coming into it, makes him way, retires, and leaves him alone to do what
he please with his Wife. They make holes in their Ears, and hang little weights of
Lead at them, which stretch them so much, that in time they reach down to their Shoulders.
The principal Commerce of this place consists in Pepper, Ginger, and Cinnamon.
               It is not long since all the Malabars had but one King;The Zamorin of Calicuth was sometime Emperour of the Malabars. but Sarama Perymal, Monarch
of all that Coast, from Goa, as far as the Cape of Comeri, having imbrac'd the Mahumetan
Religion, and desirous to end his life in solitude, near the Sepulchre of his great Prophet,
distributed his Territories amongst his Friends, upon condition that the Kings of Cananor,
Cochim and Chaule, should acknowledge the Soveraignty of the King of Calicuth, on whom
he bestowed the Dignity of Zamourin, or Emperour; but since the establishment of the
Portuguez in those parts, the power of Zamourin is grown so low, that at the present, the
King of Cochim is more powerful then he.
               Ianuary the 26. We left Cananor, and saw going thence Captain Weddell, who would
gladly have come along with us into England, had he not been obliged to go and dispatch
some business he had to do at Cochim and Calicuth. Captain Weddell cast Anchor there,
but we only fired some Guns, and pursued our Voyage.
               The next day we discover'd,An Engagement with the Malabar Pirates. at a great distance, eighteen Sail of Ships, which coming
directly towards us, easily discover'd what their design was. We had much ado to clear
our Guns, for the Ship was so loaden that every hole was full. However we had the time
to put our selves into a posture of receiving those Pyrats, who had not the confidence to
come within Cannon-shot of us, while day-light might discover them; but presently after
midnight, as soon as the Moon was up, they set upon us on all sides, though with little advantage,
for they were so well receiv'd, that at the first firing of our Guns we sunk two of
their Frigots, and made three or four others incapable of further ingaging. Our small Shot
in the mean time playing upon those which came nearest our Ship, that they thought it
their best course to let us alone.
               The same night we pass'd by the Castle of Chochim,Pass in sight of Cochim. and the next day, the twenty
eighth, we could discern no more then fourteen of the Malabar Frigats, which follow'd us
a far off, whereupon we conceiv'd the other four were sunk. Mean while, we continued
on our Voyage with a favourable Wind, discovering towards the East, a low Country
planted with Cocoes, and something farther, towards South-east, the Cape of Comory,The Cope of Comory. the
most Southerly quarter of this part of the Indies, by the Ancients call'd India on this side
Ganges.
               The night following, the Malabars made as if they would again attaque us, and two of
their Frigots came within our Cannon, we only gave them two Volleys without Bullets to
draw them nearer, but they retreated.
               On the morrow, the twenty ninth, we saw the Isle of Ceylon,The Isle of Ceylon. at the head whereof we
were fix'd as immoveable by a Calm, which lasted three weeks compleat. This Island lies
ten Leagues from the Continent, extending from South-south-east to the North-east, betwixt
the Capes of Comory and Nigapatam, which lies at eleven degrees, towards the Coast
of Coromandel. 'Tis in length sixty Leagues, in breadth forty, and about two hundred and
fifty in compass. They say, it was heretofore much larger then now at present, and that
the flowings of the Sea, which in those quarters are exceeding violent, carried part of it
away, on the side towards Comory. This, without dispute, is the richest and most fertile of
all the Eastern Islands, if we may credit Maffeus, the most learned and grave Author that
hath written of the Affairs of the Indies, or particularly the experienc'd and famous S. Borhart
in his Phaleg; this is without doubt the Ancients Taprobane,The ancient Taprobane. though Mercator, Ios. De
l' Escale, Em. Osorius, and others, take the Isle of Sumatra to be it, of which we shall speak
hereafter.
               Howsoever,Its desription. it is most certain, Ceylon, or Zeilon, is the most considerable of all the Indian
Islands, for it produces not only all such things as the other Islands afford, but moreover,
there shall you see whole Forrests of Orange and Lemmon-trees, as also of Cinnamon,
which emits its odour very far upon the Sea, and great quantity of precious Stones, in so
much as, except the Diamonds, there is no Stone which is not there found. They fish

likewise there for Pearls, but they are not so fair as those of Baharam: but in recompence
it produces the best Ivory of the World.When discovered by the Portuguez. Laurence, Son of Francisco Almeida, discover'd
it in the year 1506. who took possession of it in the name of Emanuel King of Portugal,
erecting there a Column, with an Inscription, signifying, that it had no owner, though at
the same time he had a Treaty with one of the Kings of the Island, wherein he promised
him the King of Portugal's protection, for two thousand five hundred Quintals of Cinnamon,
in acknowledgment. The Portuguez have since fortified the Town of Colombo,
which lies at seven degrees on this side the Line, and kept it, till the Hollanders, three years
since, in the year 1657. took this important place from them; by this means dispossessing
them of all they held in this Island.
               The Hollanders began not their Commerce here till the year 1602. in the time of Fimala
Derma suri Ada, King of Candy, who is the most puissant, and in a manner the soveraign
of the Island, who succeeded to the Crown by wayes so extraordinary, that I perswade my
self 'twill not be tedious to the Reader, to hear the particulars.
               Mara Ragu, King of Settavacca, had three Sons legitimate, and one natural, called Derma.The History of Fimala Derma King of Candy.
Some will have this Derma to be the Son of a Chyrurgion; but they are mistaken, it being
certain, he was the Son of Mara Ragu, begotten on one of these Balladeiraes, or Dancers,
such as almost all the Indian Princes keep for their divertisement. Mara Ragu had an affection
for this Child, and caus'd him to be brought up a Souldier, that one day he might
command his Forces; wherein Derma improv'd so well, and acquir'd such reputation, that
the Army, who conceiv'd it would be a happiness to be under a Martial Prince, established
him in the Throne, this unnatural Child having first taken away the lives of his Father
and his three legitimate Sons.Derma murthers his Father and three Brothers. The Cingales, who in this Island of Ceylon are as the Nayres
amongst the Malabares, had some regret to admit this change, and be Subjects to a Bastard:
but he began his reign with such severity, and ordered so many executions, that
they who murmur'd most were compell'd to entertain what they could not hinder, till
such time as they found means to make him away by poyson.
               The death of Derma, and that of the King of Candy, which happened much about a
time, very much advanced the establishment of the Portuguez in this Island. For, allowing
to the Cingales their ancient Liberties and Priviledges, and without scruple of Religion,
intermarrying with them, they stood fair to become Masters of the Island, had it not
been for the opposition of one Lord of the Nation, of whom they had good reason to be
confident. His name was Fimala Derma Suri Ada, and was grand Modeliar, that is,
Constable of the Kingdom of Candy, when the King dyed. He was Son to one of the
chief Princes of the Kingdom, and in his youth had his breeding amongst the Portuguez,
who brought him to Colombo, where he was baptized, and named Don Iohn of Austria, in
remembrance of the natural Brother of Philip the second King of Spain. Afterward
they educated him at Goa, whither they brought him at such time as D. Emanuel de Sousa
Coutinno was Viceroy; and he was there likewise while Matheo Albuquerque succeeded D.
Emanuel in the same Dignity.Fimala declares against the Portuguez The Portuguez observing him to be a graceful person, and
being, as they thought, sure of his affection, made no difficulty to confer upon him the Office
of Grand Modeliar of Candy, and by this means to set him in the first rank of the whole
Kingdom, wherein D. Iohn of Austria made such use of his trust, that he gain'd the affection
of all the Souldiery, so as that after the decease of the King, the Cingales promoted
him to succeed in his place.
               The first thing he did, was to put to death all the Portuguez in the Town of Candy, and
to declare war against the rest. There was yet a Princess, Heir to the Crwn, whom the
Portuguez had brought to Mannar, where they baptized her, and named her D. Katharina,
with design to make use of her when occasion should require, as in the present Conjuncture
it did. For Pedro Lopes de Sousa, Captain General of Malacca, conceiving he could
raise the Inhabitants of Candy in favour of this Princess, enters the Kingdom with a
powerful Army, and with him brings along D. Katharina with intention to marry her, by
which means he would make himself King, having first caused her to be acknowledged
Heir. He became Master of the capital Town without much difficulty, but that prov'd
his ruine. For D. Iohn, who, with his Cingales, was retir'd to the Woods, did not only
annoy him in cutting off all the Portuguez, who came out of the Town for forrage or
other necessaries of livelihood; but he so cut off all Provisions, that Lopes, to maintain his
Army, was constrain'd to betake himself to the Field, and leave the Town, to give D. Iohn
battel.Gives Battle. It was fought in the year 1590. upon a Sunday; and notwithstanding the advantage
the Portuguez had of their Fire-arms, and above fourty Elephants arm'd for war;
D. Iohn, who would now have no other name then Fimala Derma Suri Ada, routed and
absolutely defeated them. Lopes was kill'd upon the place, and D. Katharina became prisoner

to Fimala, who afterwards married her, by this means acquiring a right to the Crown,
which before he only held by the Sword.
               Four years after this Victory, D. Ieronimo d' Azeuedo, General of the Conquests of Zeilon,
having receiv'd Orders from the King of Spain for a new attempt on the Kingdom
of Candy, raises a potent Army, which the Viceroy of Goa reinforc'd with all the Cavaliers
and Hidalgos attendance:The second Battle given. he advances to Ballene the place where the first Battle was
fought, and thence sends defiance to the King of Candy.
               The Portuguez were not more fortunate in this, then they had been in the former battle;
for though the Portuguez Army receiv'd not a defeat, and D. Ieronimo got high honour by
his retreat for five dayes together in fight of the Kings Army, that pursued him to the very
Gates of Colombo; they were notwithstanding so weakned, that from that time the
Portuguez durst never attempt the Kingdom of Candy by force. Nevertheless they cease
not to maintain a war by surprizes and incursions one upon another.
               For not long before the Hollanders arrived in the Isle of Zeilon,The treachery of a Portuguez Renegado. the Portuguez were most
basely trappan'd by the double intelligence, which one Ieronimo Dias kept with them. He
was by birth a Portuguez, but as the rest of his Nation, who settle amongst the Indians,
making no difficulty to plant themselves in places where there is no publick exercise of
Religion, easily lose that whereof they had only a fleight and superficial knowledge; so
this man having renounc'd his Religion, undertook to betray his Country-men, as I am
about to tell you. This Ieronimo, being prisoner to the King, remain'd at Candy till he
had contrived the means to betray the Portuguez. Afterwards he escaped, and returning
to D. Ieronimo d' Azeuedo, told him, that if he thought fit, he would undertake to kill the
King of Candy. Azeuedo supposing after the Kings death, 'twould not be hard for him to
possess himself of the Kingdom, hearkens to the Proposition, raises to himself an assurance
in a Man, who undertakes in cold bloud to murther a Soveraign Prince; allows him three
Captains, Christoval Iacomo, Albert Primero, and Iean Pereina, with two Souldiers, to assist
him in this enterprize, which he made appear very feasible: promising to make him King
of Candy immediately upon the Kings expiration, and furnishing him with a good sum of
money for the purpose, without which, he said, there was nothing to be done. Dias would
go alone, as well that he might seem to have escaped from the Portuguez, as to dispose the
King to put these five Portuguez, his Complices, into the Fort of Ballene; for that he was to
perswade the King, that they came likewise to render themselves to him, to serve against
the other Portuguez: but being come to the King, he discover'd the double dealing he
had contriv'd, so as the night following, the King re-inforc'd the Garrison of Ballone Fort,
and went in person thither, on design to surprize the Portuguez, who were ambuscado'd in
the Woods, to affault the Fort upon notice of the Kings death.
               These five Portuguez, Confederates in Dias's treason, being arrived at the Fort, were received
in; but as they entred were conveyed into private rooms, where they were disarm'd
and put into Irons: which could not be carried with so much secrecy, but some of
those Cingales the Portuguez brought along with them discovered it, so as returning with
speed they gave notice to the Portuguez in the Ambuscade, who otherwise had run the
hazard to be cut in pieces through the ill success of the enterprize. Ieronimo Dias for his
service was rewarded with the dignity of Grand Modeliar, which he enjoy'd at the time
the Hollanders arriv'd in the Island of Zeilon,The Hollanders ill treated in the Isle of Zeilon. where they sped no better then the Portuguez.
For the King of Candy, who in the year 1602. received their Admiral with civility,
in the year following, caus'd their Vice-admiral, with fifty of his Men, to be put to death
in cold bloud; in so much as for that time they were constrained to lay aside all thoughts
of settling a trade there. But since they have found opportunity for a firm establishment,
by gaining from the Portuguez the Fort de Punto de Gallo, and fortifying the Port de Negombo,
where they drive a great trade, much augmented by their taking likewise the Town
of Colombo from the Portuguez, where these last kept commonly a Garrison of eight hundred
men.
               The King of Candy is the most puissant and most absolute of all the Kings of Zeilon.The Kingdom of Candy.
He delights in the Portuguez manner of building, and fortifies his Holds after the modern
way. This Kingdom extends it self along that River, on which the City of Vintane is
scituate, where the Kings Galleys and other Vessels have their retreat. It contains many
fair and well-built Towns.The Inhabitants. The Inhabitants are like the Malabars, but not so black.
They go naked as low as the Navel, but some use Coats or Dublets after the Portuguez fashion.
In their Ears they hang Pendants, and the greatest part have a Cris or Poniard by
their sides.The Women. Women have likewise their Breasts bare, and go very decent in habit, and in
their conversation with Men discover much of modesty. They dress their Heads much
like the European Women, laying their Hair very close on their Head, and tying their

Tresses behind. They wear Collars of Gold or Silver, and Rings upon their Hands and
Feet, and their Arms and Legs beset with abundance of precious Stones. Their houses
are conveniently enough built, and the Women very skillful in Cookery. The Cingales
addict themselves to nothing at all, nor are they fit for war, by reason they are accustomed
to so idle a life they can indure no hardship.
               Throughout the Indies there is no part so abounds in all sorts of Victuals,Victuals cheap. as this Isle
Zeilon. Fowl, Fish, Venison, Poultry, Butter, Milk and Honey, are at extraordinary low
rates, as well as Ananas, Bannanas, Cocos, Iacques, Mangas, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons,
and all other sorts of Fruits. They eat of all things in general, even of Pork, and all sort
of Cattle, except the Oxe, Cow, or Buffle; Wine they drink not, no more then the Mahumetans,Their Religion.
who dwell amongst them, and enjoy a full liberty of Religion. These Islanders
are of the same Religion as other Pagans in these parts. They bear great reverence to
their Bramans, who observe a more austere way of living, and eat not of any thing hath
had life, by reason that for the whole day they adore the first Beast they meet with at their
coming out of doors in a morning. Maids are here married at the age of ten or twelve
years: And they burn their dead Corps.
               Fimala Derma Suri Ada had gotten some tincture of Christian Religion, if at least it be
to be found amongst the Portuguez; it was soon raz'd out by the compliance he had for
the Cingales; and after his decease his Successors fell back to Paganism. There are some
amongst them, who adore the head of an Elephant, wrought in wood or stone, and say,
their intention is to obtain wisdom; for they are of opinion, the Elephants of Ceilon are
not only more knowing then other Elephants, but further, that they out-go men in judgment.
In their houses they have a Basket, wherein they put such things as they design for
an offering to their Pagodes, to whom they have a particular devotion in their sicknesses,
because it is from them alone they look for remedy. They hold, as matter of faith, that
the World shall not perish so long as their grand Mosquey, which may be seen at a great
distance from the Sea, between Punto de Gallo and Monte Calo, shall be extant. Another
particular opinion they have of a Mountain in this Island call'd Pico d' Adam, and say it
was there that the first Man was fram'd; that the Spring on the top of this Mountain
rose from the tears Eve shed for Abel; and that the Isle of Ceilon was part of the terrestrial
Paradise. To conclude, they are very docile, and willing to acknowledge the errours
of their Idolatry; in so much that there were great likelihood of their conversion, if
Christians would undertake these long Voyages, as much out of a religious zeal, as worldly
concernments.
               All the other Kings of Ceilon,Kings tributary to the Portuguez. except the King of Candy, pay tribute to the Portuguez:
but 'tis so inconsiderable, that the Princes think it not worth while to take Arms to free
themselves from a subjection, which consists but in a bare acknowledgment. For the King
of Matecalo, who is not the least considerable amongst them, payes annually but fifty Duckates.
               The Island produces Pepper, but their chiefest Commodity is Cinnamon. They find
here Mines of Brass and Iron; and certainly there is both Gold and Silver,Mines of Gold and Silver. especially in
the Kingdom of Candy, but the King will not permit a search to be made for the discovery
thereof. Their rich Stones they permit not likewise to be sold to Strangers, which are
there found in great abundance; but there is so great plenty thereof, that it is impossible
but some may be had under hand; for they are found in the heaps of Gravel, and in the
Town of Candy; nay, after the Rain hath washed down the Earth of some neighbouring
Mountains, the Inhabitants find them in the currents of Water, and though they are oblig'd
to bring them all to the King, 'tis impossible that Order should be exactly observed.
               The Island likewise yields Timber and Stone for building; the Soyl produces Corn,
Oyl and Wine, if any Man will take the pains to plant the Vine, Cotton, several Roots for
Dyers, Ginger, Cardamoms, Mirobalans, Corcoma, and divers other Medicinable Drugs,
Nutmegs, &c. but particularly so great a quantity of Rice, that the whole Coast of Caromandel
is furnished from hence. Likewise here is so great a quantity of Cinnamon, that
the Hollanders buy it for a hundred and twenty eight Livres, forty eight Souls the Quintal
or Hundred weight.

               The Calm staid our Ship hard by this Isle, for near upon three weeks, which I imploy'd
in inquiring of our President and certain Iesuits, who were aboard our Vessels, into this
pleasant part of the Indies, which I had never seen, and merits to be known by the Description
I shall make from the report of these persons, amongst whom there were some
who had spent there the best part of their lives. I will then begin with the place where
we were, and faithfully deliver you all I could learn of those Kingdoms and Provinces,
which without question are the wealthiest of any in the World.
               Towards the Cape of Comory, or Comorin, where we then were, are likewise those
Islands the Portuguez call Maldivas,The Maldives. or Maldivar. They extend along the Coast of Malabar,
having the Cape upon the North, and taking up about sevenscore Leagues by Sea,
which divides them into such small parcels, that they are esteem'd near upon a thousand.
Some are inhabited, others not, by reason they lye so low the Sea often drowns them, as it
doth likewise the Skirts of the Continent, near Cochim, and Crangonar. The Malabares
say, that heretofore they were joyn'd to the Continent, and were separated by the Sea,
which in some places hath left such narrow divisions, that an active man might leap from
one side to the other. The Capital City, which consists of four Islands, and gives them
the appellation of Maldives, or Naldive, is a place famous for trading, and the Residence for
the King of all the Islands. Except Cocoes, which are there in great abundance,
they produce little, notwithstanding the Inhabitants by industry make very neat Garments
both of Silk and Thread brought from other places; in so much that set aside
the Moguls, there are not amongst the Indians any that go more neatly apparrell'd then
they.
               As concerning Coromandel,The Coast of Coromandel. the Eastern part of the Indies on this side Ganges is so called,
a Coast divided from the Malabares by the Mountain Balagatta, extending from South to
North, from the Cape of Comorin, or rather the point of Negapatam, to the River Nagund,
and the Town of Masulepatam, containing all along the Coast, about a hundred Leagues.
'Tis the more commodious, for that it serves for a retreat to all Vessels which are constrain'd
to quit the Coast of Gusuratta during the Winter season, and it hath many good
Havens, and the best Roads of any in all the Indies.
               The Portuguez there possess the Town of Saint Thomas,The Inhabitants on the Coast of Coromandel are Christians??? at thirteen degrees, thirty two
minutes on this side the Line; and they say, that at the time when Vasco de Gama discovered
the Indies, and seiz'd on Cochim and Cranganor, the Inhabitants on this Coast, who
called themselves Christians, crav'd protection of the King of Portugal; and that arriving
at Saint Thomas they found Christians who made profession of the Greek Religion. For
this purpose they tell a Story grounded on a Tradition, which nevertheless is not to be
proved out of the Ecclesiastical History.A History of Saint Thomas. Thus then they say, that Saint Thomas, one of
our Saviours twelve Apostles, having long preach'd the Gospel in the Kingdom of Norsingia,
notwithstanding the opposition of the Bramans, resolv'd to petition the King that
he might build a Chappel for the doing of his Devotions, and that the Bramans engag'd
the King to deny him the favour. But it happened that a huge piece of Timber was so
lodg'd in the mouth of the Haven, belonging to the Town of Meliapour, then the Metropolis
of the Kingdom, that not only great Vessels, but the smaller Barks, being not able to
get in, the Trade of the Town was in a short time quite lost. There was a trial made with
a company of Elephants to remove the Tree, but in vain; then the Magicians of those
parts were imploy'd to try if their Art could do what strength could not effect, but to as
little purpose; wherefore the King proclaim'd a considerable reward to him that could
clear the Haven, which invited the Saint to offer his service, and this for no other reward,
then the mere Timber it self. His proffer to draw it out himself made him at first appear
ridiculous, and specially when they saw him tye his Girdle to it, to draw out a weight
that many Elephants had not the strength to stir; but he pulling, the Beam followed, as
easily as if it had been a little Boat, which when he had laid upon the Land, the King was
amaz'd with admiration, and in honour of the Miracle, permitted him to build the Chappel,
as he had requested. The Bramans seeing their Doctrine disparag'd by this Miracle,
and that if Christian Religion began to spread in those parts, there was little hope to support
the Pagan; they resolve to free themselves of the Apostle, and cause certain Panyms to
murther him while he was at his Devotions in his Chappel. Some there are who will have

the Church dedicated to this Saint in that place, to be built by a King of Narsinga, and
that the door was made of that miraculous beam; but the Portuguez say they built it, of
which indeed there is most probability.
               Lentscholen saith, that in these parts there are certain people with one leg bigger
then the other, and that they are held to be the Progeny of those that martyred the
Apostle.
               Maffeus, in the eighth Book of his Indian History, relates how Iohn the second King of
Portugal made search for the bones of this Saint upon the Coasts of Coromandel, which he
transported to Goa, where he built a fair Church in honour of him: but if credit may be
given to Ruffinus and Socrates, in their Ecclesiastical History, the Apostle Saint Thomas suffered
his Martyrdom at Edessa in Mesopotamia,Saint Thomas the Apostle martyr'd at Edessa. whither heretofore they made Pilgrimages
to his Sepulchre; yet Marco Paulo Veneto sayes otherwise, though with some contradiction
to himself. Gasper Balbi a Venetian Jeweller, who hath made a very handsome relation
of his Travels in the Indies, sayes, That, being at the Town of Saint Thomas, in the year
1582. there was a Church then building in the honour of Saint Iohn Baptist; and that
the building almost finished, they found they wanted Timber to perfect it, when at the
same time the Sea cast a Tree ashore of such a bulk, that looking on it as a thing extraordinary,
they would needs measure it; and finding it to be a just proportion for the Edifice,
the people cryed out a Miracle, wherein they were confirm'd, when sawing it, it yielded
just so many Beams as serv'd to finish the Church. Headds further, that the Tree came
from some far distant place, because in cutting, it sent forth such a stinking smell, that it infected
the whole Country. The Town of Saint Thomas is not very great, but the greatest
part of the Houses are of Stone, and well built. The Church there hath no Steeple, yet
may be seen at a good distance. There live here about six hundred Portuguez, or Mestizes,
besides some Armenian Merchants.
               The Indians,The Town of Meliapour. Pagans, and Mahumetans, live in the Town of Meliapour, which is seated
on a small River two Leagues from Saint Thomas Northward; but it is faln from the
pristine glory it had, when it was the Capital Town of the Kingdom of Narsinga. The
King of Portugal hath no Governour at Saint Thomas, nor so much as a Magistrate, nor any
political Order; by reason whereof divers disorders are daily committed without punishment.
               The South and South-west Winds reign here from April to September, during which
time the Road is very good; but all the rest of the year, small Barks are constrain'd to get
into the River Palacatte, and greater Vessels into the Haven of Negupatam. You have five
fathom water even within Cannon-shot of the Town; but the Sea is so rough at all
times, there is no Landing without danger!
               Upon this Coast the Hollanders have divers Plantations where they drive a great Trade;
but principally at Potlapouli, otherwise call'd Nisapatam, where they have had their
Ware-houses ever since the year 1606. and at Paleacatte, where they have built the Fort
of Geldria.
               This Country was heretofore divided into three Kingdoms, that is, Coromandel, Narsinga
and Bisnagar; but at present 'tis all subject to one Prince, who resides sometimes at Bisnagar,
sometimes at Narsinga.
               Above the Town of Masulipatam, lyes the Country, or Kingdom rather, of Orixa,Orixa???
reaching from the River of Masulipatam to the River of Guenga; but the Hollanders
would have it comprehended under the name of the Coast of Coromandel. The chief
Towns of the Kingdom are Masulipatam and Golcanda,Masulipatam and Golcanda. the one considerable for Commerce,
the other for being the Kings Ordinary Residence. The Country yields plenty of
Salt, and Diamonds are likewise there found; but all above five Caratts in weight appertain
to the King.
               Next to Orixa,Bengala. winding towards the North, lyes the Kingdom of Bengala, which gives
name to the Gulph, by the Ancients called Sinus Gangeticus. They drive here a great
trade in Rice, Sugar, and Cotton, but chiefly in Silks, which are esteem'd the best in all the
Indies. The finest Canes we have are brought from Bengala, where there likewise grows
a sort of Canes which are finer then the Osier, in so much as Vessels are made of them,
which being glazed with Lacque on the inside, cotain liquid matters, as long and as well
as a Glass or Silver Bowl. There also grows a certain Herb, having on the top of its
stalk, (which is about the compass of a mans thumb) a great button like a tassel: this
tassel is spun out, and there are excellent Stuffs made of it. The Portuguez call it Herba
de Bengala, and make of it Hangings, and Coverlets, in which they represent all sorts of
Figures.
               
               The people of the Country are all Pagans, and, in the manner of their living, exceeding
brutish.The Inhabitants. Theft is here very common, and Adultery, though it be punished with severity
by cutting off their Noses who are taken in it; they forbear not nevertheless to pollute
themselves with all sort of uncleanness can be committed in that Vice. The bear religious
worship to the River of Ganges, and hold the water hereof to be so holy, that
who wash themselves therein are cleansed from all their sins; and this superstition reaches
so far,Their superstition. that the King of Narsinga sends to the Ganges, for the water he uses for his purifications.
               The Kingdom of Pegu joyns upon Bengala,Pegu. upon the East-side, and takes its name
from the capital City, where the King hath placed the Seat of his Monarchy. This is a
very potent State, and as Gaspar Balbi sayes, (whom I follow in this Relation, because I
saw not the Country) the Metropolis is divided into two parts; the one called the old,
the other the new Town. The King, with all that relate to the Court, live in the latter,
and Merchants and Tradesmen inhabit the other. For the greatest part, the dwelling-houses
are built of Canes, but they are joyn'd to Ware-houses that are vaulted to prevent
fire. The new Town is four-square, and the Flankers of it so streight, that from any Gate
thereof one may discover both corners of the Wall. There are Bastions of Timber,Crocodiles in the Moat. and
a large Moat, full of water, where they keep Crocodiles to secure the Town from surprizal.
The Peguans hold this Creature to have something Divine about it, whence it comes they
are so desirous to drink the water, though they fetch it not without danger of being devour'd
by the Crocodiles, as it often happens. Notwithstanding, they water their Elephants
there; but this is a Beast that strikes terrour in the Crocodiles, and would be too
hard for them.
               The Palace Royal stands in the middle of the City,The Palace Royal. and hath its peculiar Fortifications,
Walls and Moats, whereby it is divided from the Town. The Castle is said to be much
more spacious then the City of Venice; and that there is no entrance but on the Townside,
by two Ports, and as many Draw-bridges. Within the first Port are the Houses of
the Grandees, who enter not into the body of the Castle, without express Order from the
King. His Guard consisting of a great number of Souldiers, with them called Bramas,
is kept at the second Port,The Guard. where they sit, having their Arms hanging before them on the
Wall. In this place are the Stables for Elephants, as well such as are kept for the Princes
service, as those design'd for War, being about eight hundred in number. The Kings Appartment
is exceeding rich, painted Azure, with Flowers of Gold; and when the King
gives Audience, he appears in great magnificence. In his hand he holds a Fan, to Fan himself,
and on his head he hath a quadruple Crown of Gold, enamell'd white. Near his person
stand four Youths, whom he makes use of in his brutalities; and before him all the
Grandees of the Court, who whensoever they speak to him lift their hands above their
head, and bow down to the ground. Being sate, they bring before him his fairest Elephants,
and amongst the rest his white one, which is said to be the only one in all the Indies, nor
ever is there more then one to be seen at Court, which was brought thither after the Victory
he gain'd against the King of Siam, with whom he had not made War but to gain that
Beast, as we shall tell you anon. These Beasts make their reverence to him, and testifie
a Worship to his Person. If we may give credit to the fore-mentioned Balbi, this,
next the King of China,The Kings Forces is the most Potent Prince on Earth. He sayes, this Prince can
bring into the Field fifteen hundred thousand Men, and above eight hundred Elephants,
and that his Treasure is sufficient for so mighty an Army, by reason every Person of Quality
is oblig'd to raise and maintain so many Men of War at his own proper charges.
               He relates to this purpose, that, in his time, the King of Auva,He makes war upon his Vncle king of Auva. his Fathers Brother, but
Vassal to the King of Pegu, denying homage to his Nephew, and to pay such Diamonds and
precious Stones as he stood oblig'd to in that consideration; the King of Pegu, who was
well assured his Uncle held a very private intelligence with some Noble men of his Kingdom,
against the security of his State and Person, to shew how mindful he was of his Fathers
request on his death-bed, and the recommendation he then made in favour of the
King of Auva; sent him an Embassadour extraordinary to reduce him to his Duty, and
perswade him to come in again to him: but his Uncle, instead of taking the advantage of
his Nephews Nobleness, puts the Embassadour to death, and declares War against the King
of Pegu. But he having raised an Army of three hundred thousand men, before he would
march into the Field, purg'd his Court, and put to death those Traytors who had ingagede
to deliver him into the hands of his Uncle. Assembling then all the Confederates of this
Treason, under pretence of calling them to a Councel about this War; he caused them to
be secured,A just execution, but too sev. and they, their Wives and Children, to be burnt alive. Then to free himself from
the Odium of so horrid an Execution, he sends to the Judge, that he should defer the Execution,

till he receiv'd express Order under his Signet; but the Dogad gini, or Judge, who had
other private instructions, proceeded according to them.
               That done, the King of Pegu appeared in the head of his Army, mounted on an Elephant,
covered with trappings of Tissue, having by his side a Sword, that was presented
him by D. Lewis of Atayda, Viceroy of Goa, resolving to march in few dayes against his
Uncle, but he was hindred by the small Pox, which he had in extremity. As soon as he
was recovered,A single Combat betwixt two Kings. he causes the Army to advance to the very Frontiers of Auva, where he
accepts a Challenge sent him by his Uncle, that they two might decide the difference
by a single Combat; and was so fortunate, as to kill his Adversary, in view of both
Armies. This single Victory was of greater advantage, then a defeat of the Enemies
whole Army could have brought him: for the whole Kingdom of Auva delivered it
self up, at mercy: The Queen, who was his Sister, fell likewise into his hands, and was
prisoner during life, though kept in a Princely Palace, and honoured and attended as a
Queen.
               The King of Pegu, in acknowledgment of the service his Elephant had done him in the
Combate, where he fell dead under his Master, caused certain Pagodes to be made of his
Tooth, and had them placed amongst the other Idols kept in a Varella, or Mosquee, which
is within the Castle.The Idols. Amongst these Idols there is the Figure of a Man, done to the life,
in massy Gold, having on the Head a Crown enchas'd with precious Stones of divers kinds,
on the Forehead a Ruby as big as a Plum, and on each side the Head Pendants as rich as
can be imagined, about the Waste a Scarf, and over the right Shoulder, and under the left
Arm, a Chain of Diamonds and other Stones inestimable. In the same Chappel are likewise
three Statues of Silver, higher by two foot then the first; with Crowns set with
Gems, and a fourth more massive and rich then all the rest, and besides these a Figure made
of Ganza, which is a mixt metal of Copper and Brass, valued at as high a rate as the
other four. The Kings Father, who lived in the year 1578. caused these Statues to be
made in memory of that famous Victory he obtain'd over the King of Siam, in the War
he made against him, for the white Elephant we spoke of.
               The Forrests of Pegu have greater store of Elephants then all the Indies besides,The Peguans Arms. and
they are tam'd with very little trouble, in ten or twelve dayes after they are taken by the
means of Females, who intice them out of the Woods, and make them follow into the very
Stables, where there are Dens that hold but one of these Beasts only, where they shut them
close in as soon as they are entred.
               The Peguans have Fire-arms, but ordinarily they use half Pikes made of Canes, short
and broad Swords, and long and narrow Bucklers made of boyl'd Leather doubled, and
laid over with a certain black Gum call'd Achiran; their Salades or Helmets are made of
the same stuff, and like ours in fashion.
               They are generally Pagans,They are Pagans. except some who contracting alliance with the Portuguez,
have embrac'd their Religion. These Pagans believe that God, who hath under him many
other Gods, is the Author of all good which arrives to Mankind; but the disposing of all
evil he leaves to the Devil,Adore the Devil. to whom these wretches bear more veneration then they do
to God; because the one will do them no hurt; and they must please the other, that he
may not.
               They do they Devotions ordinarily on the Munday,Their Feasts. and have besides, five principal
Feasts which they call Sapan. The first, which they call Sapan Giacchi, is chiefly celebrated
by a Pilgrimage, made by the King and Queen, twelve Leagues out of Town, where
they appear in triumphal Chariots, so set with precious Stones, that, without Hyperbole,
it may be said they carry the worth of a Kingdom about them. They call the second,
Sapan Carena, observ'd in honour of the Statue kept in the grand Varelle of the Castle, in
honour of which the Noblemen of the Court erect Pyramides of Canes, which they cover
with several Stuffs artificially wrought of divers fashions, then have them put into
Chariots drawn by above three hundred persons to the Kings view, that he may judge of
their inventions. All the people come likewise, and bring their Offerings to him. The
Sapan Giaimo Segienon, they celebrate also in honour of some of these Statues, where the
King and Queen are both present in person; and the fourth Feast, which they call Sapan
Daiche, is particularly celebrated in the old Town; at which the King and Queen cast
Rose-water at one another. All the Grandees have likewise a pot of Rose-water in their
hands, wherewith they so water themselves, that their bodies are as 'twere bath'd all over,
nor can any one pass the Streets that day, without hazard of being wash'd with water
thrown from the windows. At the fifth Feast, called Sapan Donon, the King and Queen
go by water to the Town of Meccao, attended by above a hundred Boats, all which row
for the fastest, to gain a Prize allow'd by the King.
               
               The King dying, they prepare two Boats, which they cover with one gilt Covering, and
in the middle of these Boats they place a Table,How the Kings Corps are burnt. whereon they lay the dead Corps; and
underneath the Table they make a fire of the Wood of Sandale, Beniouin, Storax, and
other sweet-scented Woods and Drugs, then turn the Barks down the Stream, certain
Talapoi or Priests mean while singing and rejoycing till the flesh be intirely consum'd.
These Ashes they temper with Milk, so making a Paste, which they carry to the mouth
of the River, where they cast it into the Sea. But the Bones they bear to another
place, and bury them near a Chappel, where they build another in honour of the deceased.
               Their Talapoi carry a Bottle made of an empty Gourd at their girdle,The Churchmen. and live by Alms,
as our Mendicant Friars. They are in great esteem amongst them, and they very well preserve
their credit by their exemplary life. On Munday morning they go about with their
Tin-basins, to awake the people and invite them to a Sermon. They treat not at all of
points of Doctrine, but chiefly insist upon Morality, exhorting the Congregation to abstain
from Murther, Thefe, Fornication and Adultery, and to do to others as they would be
done by. For this reason they are of opinion, that Men are sooner saved by good Works
and innocency of Life, then by Faith. They have no Aversion for those that forsake
their Religion to become Christans, so their Life be correspondent to the Profession they
make.
               They exclaim lowdly against the Offerings the Peguans make to the Devil, particularly
when they perform any Vow they made in their sickness, or in any other unfortunate Accident,
and endeavour to abolish this wicked custom, which is grown so inveterate, that hitherto
they have lost their labour. These people ordinarily live in Woods, and to prevent the
danger of wild Beasts, whereof these parts are full, they have their Couches hanging in the
Air betwixt boughs of Trees. They eat but once a day, and are habited in red Vestures
that reach to their heels, bare-footed, and over their Shoulders a short Coat or Mantle that
comes to their hams. They shave their heads, nay cannot endure hair upon any part of
their body; and to guard them from the Sun-beams they wear a Hat. Great honours
are done to them after their death, and after their Corps hath been attended certain dayes,
they are burnt with Sandale-wood, they cast the Ashes into the River, and inter the ones
near the place they liv'd in.
               Pegu yields no Corn at all,A strange Souce. but in recompence, they have more Rice then they can spend;
in so much that they can afford some to their Neighbours. They have a custom to make
a Drug of certain little Fishes, which they pound in a Mortar, and being so brought to a
Paste, they lay it in the Sun to putrifie, till it be quite corrupted, and grows moist, and then
they use it in their Sauces, instead of Oyl or Butter, making a dainty of that, which it were
not possible for us to endure the smell of.
               Sodomy was heretofore so common in those parts,Other peculiar Customs. that to extirpate this Vice, which had
near destroy'd the whole Species, one of the Queens of Pegu ordain'd by Edict; that every
Man should carry in his Yard a little Bell, which would make it swell in such sort, that
he should not be able to do Nature any violence. And to the end the Women should not
be frustrated of their due, their Virginity was to be taken away, while they were yet very
young, by means of a Composition, of contrary operation to that used by common Women
to heighten the pleasures of their Gallants. These little Bells are put in betwixt
the skin and the flesh: and to effect the operation, they cast them into a sleep, with a certain
Drink, to make them insensible of the pain they are put to by the Incision, whereof
notwithstanding they are cur'd in few dayes. For their greater aversion from Sodomy, they
paint the Boyes at seven or eight years of age with a certain blew, which extending with
the skin as it grows, changes into another colour, and makes them look most horribly. The
Women, on the contrary, do all they can to appear lovely, and attract the Men, covering
their privy parts only with a thin piece of Linnen, which sits not so close, but the least
wind shews all they have.
               All of them in general make their Teeth black, and Men, when they ride on horseback,
fill their Mouths with something that pufs out their Checks. They who marry buy their
Wives of their Parents; and when they are cloy'd send them home again, but the money
belongs to the Wife, who on her side is obliged to restitution, if sh part with her Husband
without cause.
               The King is Heir to all that dye without Children,The third part of all real Estates falls to the King. Merchandizes of Pegu??? and they who have Children can
leave them but two thirds of their Estate, the rest belongs to the King.
               The best Commodities to be brought to Pegu, and which may be sold to greatest profit,
are Stuffes and Linnen-clothes, from Saint Thomas, Musulipatam and Bengala; Pepper,
Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Optum and Sandale-wood, &c. by reason they have no other Spices

then Ginger. At Pegu they take in no other Merchandizes then Silver and Rice, which
they transport to Malacca. In bargaining they make no words at all, they do no more
but give their Hand cover'd with a Handkerchief, and in grasping or moving their Fingers
they make their meaning known. For borrowing of money they stick not to pawn their
Wives and Children; but if the Creditour enjoyes them carnally during that time, he is
then paid, and the Debtour acquitted.
               Siam,Siam. one of the most considerable Kingdoms of the Indies, lying at eighteen degrees
on this side the Line, hath on the North, the Kingdoms of Pegu and Auva; on the West,
the Gulf of Bengala, from the Haven of Martanan to the Town of Tavaga; towards the
East, Patana, whence the Coast runs first Northwards to thirteen degrees and a half, comprehending
in this space, the Gulf of Siam: And lastly, Southward, to twelve degrees, lying
more at a distance from the Sea; it joyns Eastward on the Desarts of Cambodia, and the
Kingdoms of Iangoma, Tangou and Lansiaugh, to eighteen degrees towards the forementioned
Kingdoms of Pegu and Auva, making as it were a semi-circle, containing near upon
four hundred and fifty Leagues. The Country in some parts is rough and mountainous,
in other parts covered with Woods, and to the Seawards 'tis low and marshy, and generally
flat, good and fertile, yielding in abundance all necessaries for livelihood; and having on
the Gulfes divers Isles, Rivers, Bayes, Harbours and Roads, commodious for the transportation
of such things as they themselves can spare.
               The River called Menam,Menam a River. that is, Mother of the waters, is one of the greatest India hath.
The breadth of it is not great, but its length such, that hitherto no man hath discovered
the head of it. It sends its Current from North to South, passing through the Kingdoms
of Pegu and Auva; and at last, running through Siam, by three Streams it falls into the
Gulf of Siam.Overflows as Nile doth. One quality it hath common with the Nile and Ganges, that it yearly
overflows the adjacent Country, for the space of five moneths together, destroying in that
time all Worms and Insects, and leaving, when it retires, a slime or moist soil proper for
the increase of Rice. That Channel of this River which is most commodious for Barks
or Vessels, is that, which lies most Eastwards, at thirteen degrees and a half elevation,
but what makes it almost useless, is, that there lies a Shelf a League in length, or better,
at the mouth of the River, which at low-water holds not above five or six foot
water.
               At high-water it holds fifteen or sixteen foot, and in September, October and November,
seventeen or eighteen foot. Vessels of greater burthen ordinarily stay in the Road two
Leagues from the Shelf, where having at no time less then five or six fathom water they
ride secure. They who venture to come over the Shelf with the Tide, may go up along
the River to the City of Banckock, six Leagues from the Sea, and thence may pass by
boat in five or six dayes, as high as the City of India, twenty four Leagues within the
Land, except in the moneths before mentioned, during which season the River is innavigable.
               The Provinces of this vast Kingdom are all very populous,Siam very populous. though not equally; for
such as have the Commodity of Rivers and Havens, far exceed those that lye more remote.
It would be very difficult to reckon all the Towns of this great Dominion:
wherefore we will here give only an account of the principal and most considerable, either
for greatness, or as the most considerable of the several Provinces. The chief of the
Kingdom is India, by some called Odya; then Camboya, Campaa, Sincapura, Picelouck,
Surkelouck, Capheng, Soucethay, Kephinpet, Conseywan, Pytsyay, Pitsedi, Lidure, Tenou,
Mormelon, Martenoy, Lygor, Bordelong, Tanasserim, where the Portuguez drive a
good Trade, Banckock, Pipry, Mergy, &c. Besides which, there are many more,
which rather deserve a place in a Map, then in the Relation of a particular Mans
Travels.
               The City of India,India. the ordinary Residence of the Court, is seated on the River Menam,
which makes an Island entirely taken up by that City, having on the River-side a strong
sufficient wall, for about two Leagues in compass, and the Suburbs on both sides the River,
as well built and adorn'd with Temples and Palaces as the Town it self. Here are divers
very fair Streets, with Channels regularly cut; but withall there are some which are neither
large nor fair, though the River crosses the Town in so many places, that there is
scarce a house but may be gone to by boat.
               The Houses here,Its houses. as generally all over the Indies, are but of ordinary building, and for
the most part covered with Tiles. There are within the Town above three hundred fair
Mosqueys, or Chappels, with gilt Steeples, or Pyramides, which at a distance yield a glorious
prospect, with abundance of Pagodes of all sorts of Metals. The Palace, which is as it
were a City of it self within the other, hath its Towers and Pyramides gilt, so as the City

of India may be said to be as beautiful, as large, and as populous as any City in India; nevertheless,
I will not affirm what Fernando Mendez Pinto writes, that it contains within its
Circuit four hundred thousand Families, whereof three quarters are Siamezes??? but thus
much I can add, that the City hath this advantage, that it is impregnable; for being of
it self strong enough to indure any Siege for many moneths; it hath an infallible relief,
which never fails at six moneths end, by reason that the River overflowing, no Line can
withstand it, nor no Camp can be so strong but must dislodge.
               The King of Siam that now reigns,The King of Siam of a very ancient Family. and who amongst his other Titles, takes that of Precau
Salcu, that is, Sacred Member of God, holds the Crown from his Ancestors, who have
possessed it for many Ages; and next to the Mogul, this Prince can reckon more Kings of
his Family, then any Prince of the Indies.
               He is absolute Monarch in his Dominions,Is absolute. solely disposing, with an Independant Authority,
of all Affairs of his Kingdom. He makes War and Peace, imposes Taxes on
his Subjects, creates Magistrates, sets value on Money, and makes Laws and Statutes,
without the consent or advice either of States or Lords: He allows them to consider of
such Affairs as come to their knowledge, and to offer him their Advice by way of Remonstrance;
but he reserves to himself the Power to approve, or reject, what he
pleases.
               These Noble men are called Mandorins; and are there as the Privy Council, a quality
the King bestows on whom he pleases, as he doth of all other Honours in the Kingdom,
without regard either to birth or merit; because his Subjects are his Slaves, and the King
is Master of all they possess, even their very lives, whereof he hath power to dispose to his
service and advantage. 'Tis true that in this, as in deposing the Mandorins from their
Dignities, and reducing them to the rank of their fellow Subjects, he observes some appearance
of Equity, by following in some measure the Laws of the Kingdom, but being above
the Law, he explicates and executes it as he pleases.
               The Prince is exceeding magnificent in his Apparel and Train,His manne of life. but his State appears in
nothing more then his manner of living. For the people, who seldom see him, have a peculiar
Veneration for his Person, nor do the Grandees and Officers scarce ever come into his
presence. When he gives Audience, he sits most gloriously habited on a Throne of Gold,
with a Crown on his head, and at his feet the Officers and Gentlemen of the Houshold on
their knees; and not far from him a Guard of three hundred Souldiers. No one speaks to
him but on the knee, and they who come for audience present themselves in this sort, their
hands being lifted above their head, and making to him ever and anon most low reverences:
The continual inclinations that are made him, and the Titles given him, must likewise be
accompanied with oblieging speeches, and attributions beyond what either greatness or
goodness can deserve.
               His Answers are receiv'd as Oracles, and his Orders executed without delay or dispute.
He hath in every Province of his Kingdom his Palaces and Gardens: when he removes his
Houshold, he hath with him a number of Elephants loaden with Tents, to be pitched when
he comes to places fit to rest in.
               He hath but one Wife.Hath but one Wife, to whom they give the Title of Queen; but he hath an infinite
number of Concubines, which are chosen for him out of the fairest Virgins of the Kingdom.
He feeds very high, but drinks only Water, because the Laws both Civil and Ecclesiastical
prohibit the use of Wine to Persons of Quality; when he pleases to recreate himself
upon the River, he goes in a splendid gilt Barge under a Canopy of Brocadoe, attended
by some of his Domesticks, and a Guard of three or four hundred, in seven or eight other
Barges, which have each of them fourscore or a hundred Slaves to row. The Noblemen
who follow, and are sometimes to the number of a thousand or twelve hundred, have each
their several Barge.
               The like is done when the King goes from his Palace into the City; Then he sits in a
Chair of Gold, born on the shoulders of ten or twelve Waiters, having marching before
him many Elephants and Horses richly harnessed, in this sort marching with a slately and
grave pace, while the people prostrate themselves to him, and render him the same honours
they might do to God himself.
               He appears particularly in his greatest Magnificence on a certain day in October, designed
for this Ceremony.A magnificent Precession. On this day, he appears both in the City, and upon the River, to make
a procession to one of his chiefest Mosquees, whither he goes to sacrifice, and to do his Devotions
for the prosperity of the State. In the head of this procession march about two
hundred Elephants, each of them carrying three arm'd Men??? then comes the Musick,
consisting of Hoboyes, Tabours, and Cimbals: next come about a thousand Men compleatly
arm'd, divided into several Companies that have their Colours and Banners. Next to

these follow many Noble men on horseback, and amongst them some with Crowns of
Gold upon their Heads, with a Train of fourscore or a hundred persons on foot. Betwixt
these Noble men and the Life-guard, march two hundred Souldiers, Iaponeses, all very well
cloath'd, and go immediately before the Horses and Elephants, which are for the Kings particular
use, their harness made with Buckles and Studs of Gold, set with Diamonds and
other precious Stones. The Servants, who bear the Fruits and other things for the Sacrifice,
march before certain Grandees of the Kingdom, whereof one bears the Kings Standard,
the other the Scepter of Justice. These walk on foot immediately before the King, who
sits, mounted on an Elephant, in a Chair of Gold. The Prince his Son, or some other
Prince of the Bloud, follows next after him, and then comes the Queen and the Kings other
Women on Elephants, but not to be seen, as being in certain wooden Closets gilt. The
rest of the Houshold, and six hundred of the Guard, come in the Rear, which by this means
consists of fifteen or sixteen thousand persons.
               As to their Procession upon the River,Procession upon the River. they observe the order following. First, in the
head of this Fleet march about two hundred Noble men, each in his several Barge, where
they sit in a gilt Cabin, and each Barge row'd by three or fourscore Slaves. Then follow
four Barges assign'd for the Musick, and next follow about fifty Barks of State, each having
fourscore, or fourscore and ten Rowers; and after these come ten other gilt Barges, in one
of which the King is seated in a Throne of Gold, attended by divers Noble men, all upon
their knees before him, and amongst them, one of the chiefest Mandorins, who bears his
Standard. The Prince follows after him in another Barge, and after him comes the
Queen, and the Concubines; And lastly, in a great number of other Barges, the houshold
Servants and the Guards, so as that this Procession consists of twenty five or thirty thousand
persons, who come either to see the magnificence of the Ceremony, or to adore their
Prince.
               Since the thirds of all real Estates fall to the King,The Revenue. we may well suppose his Revenue
to be very great; but this advantage comes not near the profits accrewing to him by the
Commerce, which by Factours he holds with Strangers for his Rice, Copper, Lead, and
Salt-peter. He hath in his Country good store of Gold; and the Customs he hath of all
Merchandizes, both coming in and going out, bring considerable sums, besides the Presents
which Governours of Provinces are obliged to make him every year. A great profit likewise
he raises by Commerce with ready Money into China, and along the Coast of Coromandel,
which yields him yearly two thousand Cattys of Silver advantage. He hath
throughout his Kingdom abundance of Officers for managing of his Revenue, and receiving
his Moneys, which as Mendez Pinto sayes, amounts annually to twelve Millions
of Duccats; but principally in the City of India, whither they repair from all other
parts,His Expences. once a year, to make their accounts. The greatest charge the King is at,
next his Houshold, is in building places and Mosquees, rewarding Services, and maintaining
his Guards, the rest comes into the Treasury, which by this means swells almost to
infinity.
               Most Cities have their particular Jurisdictions, and Judges for Administration of Justice,
to take an account whereof there is a Council appointed in the City of India, consisting
of a President, and twelve Councellors, who give a definitive Sentence, and decide all
differences brought before them by way of appeal: 'tis nevertheless allowed them sometimes
to prevent these Sentences by a Review before the Privy Councel??? but this happens
not frequently, by reason, the Charges are so great, very few will undertake it. They
plead by Councellors and Atturneys, both by word and writing, but in presence of both
parties who are to enter a Summary of the Plea in the Recorders Register. But besides
Counsellors and Atturneys, you have here the Pettifogger, who is inseparable; so as Suits
sometimes last whole Ages here as well as in other places.
               In Criminal matters, they have an extraordinary and summary way, but much after the
same form and manner used in France.
               First, They inform, then imprison, then examine; the Parties are brought face to face;
and where evidence falls short, they are put to the Rack, upon pregnant presumptions,
The Steward records the whole, and makes report to the Judges, who upon the criminal
Confession, or Deposition of Witnesses, give Judgment, and cause the Sentence to be executed
immediately, without appeal, save that they never put any to death without the
Kings express Order, in whose power it lyes to confirm the Sentence, or pardon the Party,
as he pleaseth.
               Their punishments are severe, rather cruel: The slightest Crime is punished with pecuniary
Fines,Their punishments. Banishment, or Transportation: For Theft they suffer amputation of Hands
or Feet, or are condemned to perpetual slavery. The ordinary punishments of these

Countries are unknown there; but condemned persons are cast alive into boyling Oyle,
according to the atrocity of the Crime, but alwayes with Confiscation of Goods, for the
benefit of the King, and the Judges.
               In want of sufficient Testimony,Manners of Iustification. they make use of certain extraordinary wayes for
Conviction, or Justification of the Criminal, which they do by consent of all parties, with
the Judges permission, who allows them to maintain what they say, by Water, by Fire, or
by boyling Oyl. When they submit to the Tryal of Water, the Accuser, and the accused
party are both let down along a great Pole, which is planted in the River, and he that
stayes longest under water gains the day; as he that patiently holds his Hand longest in
boyling Oyl. Others, who chuse the tryal of Fire, are to go five or six steps, very slowly,
in a great Fire, and that betwixt two Men, who lean as hard as they can upon their
shoulders. But the way they hold most infallible for their justification, is, to swallow a
Pill of Rice, over which their Priests have pronounced some words of malediction, which
he that swallows without spitting is so clearly justified, that his friends attend him in triumph
to his habitation.
               The Kings Armies consist chiefly of his Subjects;The Militi of Siam. for though besides five or six hundred
Iaponeses, who bear the reputation of Valour throughout the Indies; he hires sometimes
both Rasboutes and Malayes; the number is notwithstanding so small, that 'tis inconsiderable.
The King now reigning had taken so great an aversion for the Iaponeses,
on suspition they had a design upon his person, that he put some to death, and expell'd the
rest. Yet since that he hath given way for their return to their ancient trust; but, as I
said, they exceed not the number of five or six hundred. His Subjects are obliged to go
to the Wars at their own charges, so that according as occasion requires, he calls out the
hundredth, the fiftieth, the twentieth, the tenth, and sometimes the fifth man; besides
those, the Noble men, at their own charges, bring along with them a sufficient Guard of
their persons: By this means he raises at a small charge a most puissant Army, wherein
there shall be sometimes three or four thousand Elephants, though he seldom raise an Army
of above fifty or threescore thousand men.
               His Infantry are well enough disciplined,Their Arme. but very ill armed; only Bows and Arrows,
Swords, Pikes and Bucklers, without Fire-armes. Nor are their Horse better appointed,
as being but poorly mounted; so as his chiefest strength consists in his Elephants, which
are train'd to the work, and carry each three arm'd men; but many which are brought
out with the Army are employed about the Baggage. Great Artillery they have, but
manage them ignorantly. Their Naval Forces are in as ill condition as their Land; consisting
in a multitude of Frigots and Gallies, well furnished with Artillery, but their Souldiers
and Sea-men are inexpert. There is an infinite number of Barks for service against
the Enemy upon the River, as advantagious to them as at Sea, by reason his Neighbours
are rather worse provided then he; but all his Forces joyned together were not sufficient
to oppose a Spanish, English, or Holland Fleet; yet this Princes Predecessors have often had
great Victories over their Enemies, while Martial Princes have had the Conduct of their
Armies.
               The Kings of Pegu and Siam have at all times pretended to a sole Monarchy over all
the Kingdoms in these parts,Both the Kings of Siam and Pegu pretend to Soveraignty. and without dispute Pegu had something the better, but the
continual War they have held, as well for this as other differences, hath so wasted the
Frontiers of both these Kingdoms, that the Armies are not able to subsist there any longer,
and so necessity forced them to conclude a Peace; which since they break not, but by incursions
of some flying Army of twenty or thirty thousand, during the Summer Season.
The last War the King of Siam made upon the Kings of Iangoma and Langsgaugh were
purely out of ambition for the Soveraignty they pretended to over those Kingdoms. 'Tis
not long likewise since the King of Cambrodia, a Tributary to the King of Siam, revolted;
whereupon Siam enters his Territories with a potent Army, but was opposed so vigorously,
that he was forced to retire. The Kingdom after this enjoyed a long peace, till
the deceased King having caused his Brother to be murthered to establish his Son upon
the Throne, one of the Princes of the Bloud took occasion to usurp the Crown, as I shall
immediately tell you.
               This Usurper made shew as if he would espouse the interests of the State against the
Kings of Pegu and Auva, and especially against the King of Cambodia, though he would
not enter into open Hostility with them, because he might have enough to do to stand
arm'd against the designs the right Heirs might have upon his person.
               He continued likewise the same friendship for the Hollanders his Predecessour had testified
to them,The King of Siam friend to the Hollander??? since he took their part against Fernando de Silva, Governour of the Manilles.
This Portuguez taking the confidence to set upon a Holland Frigot upon the River of Menam,

in the year 1624. the King seiz'd upon his Vessel, and forced Fernando to restore the
Frigot. Since which time the Siameses have been continually vext by the Portuguez in
their Traffick with China, though the Hollanders assist them effectually against their Enemies,
and declare highly for them; as they lately likewise assisted the King of Siam with
six Ships, to chastise the Rebels of Patany.
               For certain, the King of Siam keeps more Elephants then any other Prince of India,
and herein consists his chiefest Forces. For though the Indians affect this Beast, of what
part so ever he is, yet have they a particular esteem for those of Siam, for their make, their
strength,Elephant hunting. and, as they call it, for their apprehension. They take them here as they do in
Pegu, bringing into the Forrest fifteen or twenty tame Females, which being, as it were,
Decoyes, suffer themselves to be led up and down, till some of the wild Elephants herd
with them, and so are by little and little betrai'd into a large Court well wall'd about, to
which you enter by a double walk of Trees, which as well as the Court is shut up with
strong Rails: As soon as the Elephants are in, then are the Females let out one by one at
another Gate, leaving the wild by themselves. Within this Court are two four-square
Partitions, divided with Pallizadoes like Cages, the one in the middle, the other at the side
of the wall. The posts whereof they are made, are set at such distance, that men may
with ease pass in and out to vex and provoke the Beasts; but they must make a swift retreat
within their Appartment, when this formidable Foe pursues them. This is the most
acceptable divertisement can be presented to the King, who with the Nobility of his
Court is ever present at this hunting. After the Elephants are by this kind of hunting
sufficiently tired, they drive them into another close Pen no bigger then their bodies, made
of strong beams, where they tye them by the legs to three or four tame Elephants; whereupon
hunger and acquaintance with the others, in three or four dayes bring them to live
as they do. Sometimes they hunt them in the Forrest, and open Champion, with tame
Elephants, till at last they fasten them by the legs together, and so by force drive them
away, but this not without conflict and danger.
               Sometimes in the Kingdom of Siam they meet with white Elephants.A white Elephant??? All over India
they have a veneration for this Creature: but the Siameses, and the people of those parts,
say, they are the Kings of the Elephants; in so much as the King of Siam, when he meets
with one, causes him to be served in Vessels of Gold, to walk under a Canopy, and allows
him a Princely train.
               In the year 1568. the King of Pegu, understanding that the King of Siam had two
white Elephants,The occasion of the war between the Kings of Pegu and Siam. sent a solemn Embassy to request he might buy one of them, and that
he would set a price upon him; which the King of Siam refusing, the King of Pegu resolves
to fetch him with a powerful Army. He found such slender resistance in Siam, that
the King seeing his Kingdom and chief City in the hands of his Enemies, took poyson,
whereof he dyed, though that Conquest cost the King of Pegu the lives of five hundred
thousand men.
               Raja Hapi,Raja Hapi King of Siam. King of Siam, who lived about the year 1616. acknowledged at that time
the Soveraignty of the King of Pegu, but this was only till he could find opportunity to
free himself from this subjection, as he did few years after. For entering the Kingdom
of Pegu with a powerful Army, he laid iege to the City of Aracam; resolved not to
move thence till he had taken it. In effect he rais'd not the Siege, but not being able to
force the City, and unwilling to break his Oath, he built a House near it, where he dyed.
This Prince was so famous for his cruelty, that 'tis reported of him, that being sick, and
hearing two of his Concubines laugh in an anti-chamber, he commanded they should be
immediately cut to pieces. He had a Favourite, called Ochi Chronwi, whose ambition
swell'd to that height, that he brought four or five hundred Iaponeses into the Kingdom,
cloath'd like Merchants, to be imployed to murther the King, and settle him upon the
Throne. This design took no effect during the Kings life, but he being dead, Ochi Chronowi
seiz'd on the Crown, and caused himself to be proclaimed King. The Son of Raja
Hapi had friends sufficient to cast out this Usurper, but he was not fortunate enough to keep
the Crown in his possession, for he was likewise slain, and left it to his younger Brother alive
at this day. 'Tis not long since the King of Siam had the satisfaction to have two young
white Elephants together, but they both dyed in a short time.
               The Indians do believe that a white Elephant hath something in it of divine, and say,
they respect it not only for the colour, but they observe in him that he looks to be treated
as a Prince, and that he is troubled, when other Elephants render not him the honour due
to him.
               The King of Siam is a Pagan,The King a Pagan. nor do his Subjects know any other Religion. They
have divers Mosquees, Monasteries and Chappels, where their Ecclesiasticks retire and assemble

to do their Devotions. They are discerned from other buildings by the gilt Towers
and Pyramides. There are infinite Pagodes of Gold, Silver, Stone, Timber, and other
materials, of all sizes; some of twenty, some thirty, fourty, fifty foot, and amongst the rest
one which sits, which if it stood, would be sixscore foot in height.
               Their ecclesiasticks are very exemplary in their life,A Hierarchy. having amongst them a kind of Hierarchy,
under the direction of the High-Priest of the Grand Mosquey of the City of India,
to whom all the rest yield obedience. In matters of Religion his Authority is great, but
in Temporals he acknowledges the King, and yields him the same respect as his other Subjects
do. In the City of India, there are above thirty thousand of these Ecclesiasticks;
who are easily known by their habit, for they all wear Garments of a yellow Linnen-cloath,
and have their Crowns shav'd. Amongst them they chuse the most learn'd and accomplish'd
for Priests, and to take charge of the Mosqueys. These are as Parsons amongst them,
who on Festival dayes preach to the people,Vow Chastity, but may quit the priesthood. and sacrifice to their Idols. They are prohibited
the company of Women on pain of being burnt alive: but their Vows are not so
indispensible, but such as have not the gift of Continency are allowed to change their profession;
every Mosquey hath a Convent belonging to it, for entertainment of Priests design'd
for the service, which is regularly said, morning and evening. They live partly on the
Revenue of the Mosqueys, and partly on Gratuities given them by the King and Nobility,
in the way of Almes, but they have their chiefest livelihood at the peoples Charge, by begging
every day through the City, like our Friars Mendicants. They have likewise Religious
Women and Beguins,Beguins. who are aged, devout Women, who inhabit near the Mosqueys,
that they may be present at all the Church-Services; but these make no Vow, nor are obliged
to any particular rule of Discipline.
               They believe there is one God,Their belief who created the Universe, and hath under him divers
other Gods, by whom he governs the World. They believe the Soul is immortal, and
that at its departure out of the Body, it goes either to injoy beatitude, or into eternal torments,
having first passed through other Bodies. This is the ground of their Religion,
which, they say, they have received from time immemorable by Tradition of Saints, whom
they have exalted to Deities, and now do part of their Devotions to them. They hold
likewise, that good works will save them, and in particular their Charity, which they direct
not to men alone, but to Beasts likewise. And hence it is, that on Festival dayes, the
people bring Birds and Fish hard by the Mosqueys, which they buy on purpose to set them
at liberty, because with the Benjans they believe a Metempsychosis, or transmigration of
Souls.
               In their Ceremonies they use abundance of lights,Lights in the Mosqueys. which they set up before their Pagodes,
in time of Service. They likewise Incense them, and adorn them with Flowers and precious
Stones. They have no certain day in the week design'd for their Devotions, but
they have some in particular every quarter of the Moon, and observe moreover a sort of
Lent for three moneths, during which they abstain from several sorts of Meat.
               They pray for the dead,Prayers for the dead. and bury them with many Ceremonies. They wash, shave, and
perfume the Corps in the presence of the Ecclesiasticks; then they are brought near the
Mosqueys, where the Corps is burnt, and the Ashes buried in the same place, under a rich
Tomb or stately Pyramide, according to the degree and abilities of the deceased. The
nearest Relations shave themselves, give Alms, procure the Priests to say Prayers, and attend
the body with Musick, Theatrical Representations, and Fire-works, so as these Obsequies
put them to great charges.
               They never dispute with any of a contrary Religion, but believe, that by living well
they may be saved in any Religion: though they are so fixt to their own, that there is no
hope of ever introducing another. The Portuguez endeavoured to catechise some, but with
as little effect as the Mahumetans, who would have brought in the Alcoran.
               The inferiour people here invoke the Devil,The Siamedes invoke the Devil. contrary to the doctrine of their Ecclesiasticks,
who incessantly preach against this abomination; but hitherto they cannot pluck
up this rooted wickedness, which they sucked in with their first Milk.
               The Siameses are comely,Are well shpd. and well proportioned, but ill Souldiers, though cruel and insolent
enough after Victory. They are rather black then brown, ingenious in Commerce,
but they are cautious, dissident, dissemblers, unconstant, false, and lyars.
               The Men are lazy,Their qualities. and care for no employment which requires labour, such they leave to
their Women and Slaves, leaving affairs and husbandring of land to their charges, while
they walk the Streets, or make their addresses at Court. They cover themselves with a
painted Cloath from the Navel to the Kces.Their habits. Men wear short Shirts with sleeves hanging
to their Elbows, and Women hide their Breasts with a linnen Cloath, which is fastned
about their Neck. All observe one fashion in Clothes, so as Persons of Quality are not

to be distinguished from others, but by their Train, which consists of about five and twenty
or thirty Slaves.
               Their Houses are made of Timber or Canes,Their houses. of a fashion peculiar to the Country, and
covered with Coco leaves, they are raised three or four foot from the ground, and in every
partition have several windows, which is very commodious. They have no other moveables
then what are necessary for the Chamber and Kitchin, and their diet is Rice, Fish and
Pulse, and they drink nothing but Water, but at Feasts they make better cheer, and are
willing to be invited to be drunk with Arac or Strong-water.
               Ecclesiasticks meddle not in the marriages of Persons of Quality,Their marriages. by reason the parties
are content to confide in each other for the conditions agreed upon, and obtaining the
consent of their Parents they consummate the marriage. But they ever reserve liberty of
separation, with an equal division of Goods and Children, without License of any Magistrate,
and to marry again, with whom, and as oft as they will. Their contract with their
Concubines is of a different kind, for they are considered but as Slaves, and under the authority
of the Wife, who on her part is satisfied with this precedency, knowing her Children,
who are only esteemed legitimate, shall divide all, leaving to the natural but a very
small share.
               The Estates of Persons of Quality are ordinarily divided into three parts; one falls to
the King; one to the Ecclesiasticks, they defraying the Funeral Charges, which there are
great; and the third to the Children. People of middle condition buy their Wives, and
consummate the Marriage, after payment of the sum accorded on; but have the same priviledge
of Divorce as the others.
               Their Children divide the inheritance equally, except the eldest, who hath some advantage.
               Till they are five or six years of age,Education of Children. they bring up their children with little care; then
they put them to the Ecclesiasticks to be taught to write and read and to be instructed in
Religion; during which time they see their children but very seldom; but having learnt
these first Rudiments, they put them to a Trade; or if they find them to be ingenious,
they continue them in their Studies, to make them capable of the Priestly Function, or fit
for some imployments, which among them are bestow'd according to merit, and not sold
for money. Those who live in Cities subsist by Merchandize, turn Courtiers, or betake
themselves to some Handy-craft, or else become Fisher-men, whereof there are very many
along the Coast, as there are also in those Cities, which have the convenience of any River.
The Peasantry is very wretched, living only on their labour, employing themselves in dressing
the Cocoes, and in breeding Cattle and Poultry, but Provisions are so exceeding cheap
that they make very little advantage thereby.
               In the City of India,The Traffick of the City of India. the principal Commerce consists in Stuffs brought from Suratta,
and the Coast of Coromandel, all sorts of Chinese commodities, precious Stones, Gold, Benjamin,
Wax, Copper, Lead, Indico, Calamba-wood, Brasil-wood, Cotton, Saphires, Rubies,
&c. but above all, Deer-skins, whereof they furnish the Iaponeses with above fifty
thousand every year. It likewise yields a great trade of Rice, which they transport to
all the neighbouring Islands. By reason of the abundance of these Commodities, there is
scarce a Nation throughout Asia that have not their Merchants in India, besides the
Portuguez and Hollanders, who have some years since settled themselves in those
parts.
               The King himself likewise trades amongst them,The King a Merchant. and for that purpose hath his Factors
at Pegu, at Auva, at Iangoma, at Lansiaugh, upon the Coast of Coromandel, and principally
at China, where he hath those priviledges which are not allowed to any other
Prince.
               The Money of this Country is very good,The money of Siam. by reason the King only hath power to
stamp, and so prevents variation of the value; there are of it three sorts; Ticals, Mases,
and Foangs. Two Foangs make a Mase, and four Mases make a Tical, worth about
thirty Sols French money. Four Ticals make a Tayl, and twenty Tayls a Catly in Silver.
In Silver their least money is a Foang,Mney of Shels. but they make use of a certain sort of Shells
brought them from Manilles, from Borneo, and Lequeo, whereof eight or nine hundred
amount to a Foang, without which they could not chaffer, by reason Victuals are so cheap,
that a Man may buy more there for five of these Shells, then in any part of Europe for a
Farthing.
               The Portuguez finding of what consequence the King of Siam's friendship is to them,
for supporting of their Trade with the Moluccas, the Philipine Islands, or Manilles,
have still a particular care to preserve a good correspondence, by civilities from the
Viccroys of Goa to the King at their arrival in the Indies, and by Persons of Quality

daily commission'd thither, confirming themselves by this means so well in the Princes favour,
that he not only allows them to trade throughout his Dominions, but imploys them
in his most important Affairs, permitted them to build a Church in his chief City, and
maintains one of their Priests at his own charge. They enjoy'd all these priviledges, till
such time as the King of Siam began to favour the Hollanders, whom he found less insolent
and more sincere then the Portuguez, who jealous of the affection of the King shewed to
the Hollanders, presently obstructed the Commerce the Siameses held at Saint Thomas and
Negapatam, and proceeded so far, as at last, in the year 1624. they set upon a Dutch Frigot
upon the River Menam, as we told you before: whereat the King was so offended, that
the Bishop of Malacca, having a Vicar Resident at India, he forbad him to come to Court.
The Portuguez instead of making amends for this first fault, in a conjucture when the
Hollanders, their profess'd enemies, might have joyn'd with the King of Siam, continued
still to obstruct the Commerce of the Siameses; in so much that the King perceiving their
design was absolutely to destroy it, was out of all patience??? and in the year 1631. stayed
one of their Ships with all the Men; but they finding means to make an escape, contrary
to their parole, he put an Imbargo upon all the Portuguez Ships, which were found in the
Ports of Lygoar and Tanassary, and put all the Men in prison, out of which they were not
set at liberty till two years after.
               The Hollanders made their first establishment there,The settlement of the Hollanders at Siam at the beginning of his age, though
it is only since the year 1634. that they trade there with any profit: they have made great
advantages of the friendship of that King, in order to the Commerce they have at Iava
and Sumatra.
               On the North-west side of the Kingdom of Siam, lies that of Cambodia, which on the
other side hath nothing but the Sea. The Metropolis, from which it derives its name,
lies sixty Leagues from the Sea, upon a pleasant River, which rises out of a great Lake, as
do also all the other Rivers of the Kingdom. But in that of Cambodia, it is particularly
observable, that it overflows every year as the Nile doth; and as doth also the River Menam,
in the Kingdom of Siam. It begins to rise at the beginning of Iune, and so rises
by degrees to ten or twelve foot; but in Iuly and August 'tis not navigable, for that it
drowns the whole Country. The City of Cambodia, to prevent these Deluges, is built
upon an advantagious rising, having but onely one street, and is inhabited by Iaponeses,
Portuguez, by Cochinchinez and Malayes. The Portuguez carry Malacca-Stuffs thither,
and there load with Benjamin, Lacque, Wax, Rice, Brass, Vessels and Bars of China-
Iron.
               The King,The Pallace Royal. who is but a Vassal of the King of Siam's, resides in the City of Cambodia,
in a Place fortified with a good Pallisado instead of a Wall, where are some Pieces of
China Artillery, and about twenty four or twenty five pieces of Cannon, which he recovered
out of two Holland Ships wrack'd on that Coast, all mounted on four-wheel'd-Carriages,
only painted blew, except four which are mounted on ordinary Carriages, varnish'd
black, with Ladles and other Utensils of Silver, or Iron, so polished they might be taken for
Silver. The King of Cambodia is nothing so powerful as the two Kings whom we last
mentioned; for an Army of twenty five or thirty thousand is the most he can draw into
the Field, so as were the Siameses more Martial, they might with small trouble make Cambodia
subject to their King.
               The Nobility of the Court are divided into Ockinas,The Lords of Cambodia. Tomimas, Tonimnes, Nampras and
Sabandars, each in his degree, but for the best part without any particular charge, except
the first, who are most considerable in publick Assemblies, distinguished by little Cabinets of
Gold carried after them, wherein are Cardamum and other Drugs to rub their Lips, Cissars
to cut their Bettele, by them called Pynang, and for the Lime, Areca and Bettele, which they
chew continually. In the presence of the King, whether it be for Councel or Complement,
they stand in a semi-circle, and behind them the Tommaes, known from the others by
their Bottles of Silver.
               No address is made to the King, but by mediation of these Ockinas; for though the
Priests are next his Person, between him and the Ockinas, and converse familiarly with him,
they esteem it notwithstanding a king of Sacriledge for an Ecclesiastick to meddle in secular
Affairs, so as none but the Ockinas communicate general or particular Affairs to him;
of which 'tis their Office to take cognizance, as also of the Kings Orders upon their report.
In the whole Town there is but one Pagode or Mosquee, wherein there are three bigger,
and three lesser Statues. It is supported with wooden Pillars, varnished black, with a
folliage of Gold, and the floor covered with Mats. Their Priests have no houses near the
Pagode, and when the chief of their Ecclesiasticks dyes, they build him a Monument of
Stone, which at the bottom is four-square, and upwards to the top grows round like a Pear.
               
               The Portuguez are so well settled here, that the Hollanders cannot hope to carry on any
Trade,The Portuguez cluded the Hollanders till they have first destroyed that of the Portuguez. At their first Arrival, in the
year 1637. they committed the management of their Affairs to an adoptive Son of the
Queen, to whom the King had given the name of Tisnecha, and the honour of Nampra,
and they used the credit of the Chabandar of the Iaponeses, in hope by this means they
might gain a small establishment. But the friendship they had contracted with the King
of Siam, and the Artifices of the Portuguez, bred them difficulties they could not master,
otherwise they might have laded there yearly eighty or a hundred thousand Deer-skins,
besides Neat and Buffles hides, above a hundred Picols of black Lacque, at ten Thails the
Picol, above three or four hundred Picols of Benjamin, at seventeen or eighteen Thales the
Picol, and might have vented their Cotton-yarn, and Cloath, for above sixty or seventy in
the hundred profit.
               Provisions in these parts are so plentiful, that the Inhabitants having so much more
then they have use for, sell them in a manner for nothing, specially Venison, Beef, Pork,
Goats, Hares, Kids, Cranes, Herns, and all sorts of Poultry; as likewise Oranges, Citrons,
Mangas, Cocoes, &c. but to judge the better of the fertility of this Soyl, take
notice, that the people of Quinam alone fetch yearly thence two thousand Coyangs of
Rice, five Coyangs making four Lestes, or eight Tuns, at seventeen or eighteen Thails
the Coyang. And so much by way of Account of the small Kingdom of Cambodia.
               That Tongue of Land is called Malacca,Malacca. which in form of a Peninsula extends it self
from the Kingdom of Siam, from the South-east towards the North-west, even to the
Equinoctial Line, betwixt the Gulfs of Bengala and Siam, or Cambodia; and contains,
besides the City of Malacca, (whence it derives its name) the Kingdom of Iahor and
Patana.When discovered. The Country was discovered by Alphonso d' Albuquerque, in the year 1511.
since when the Portuguez have kept their ground there so firmly, that none yet can supplant
them. Malacca is scituate upon the strait that divides the Isle of Sumatra from the
Continent, on this side the Line two Degrees and half, in a large Plain, where there is but
only one Mountain, the foot whereof is almost wholly taken up with the Town, leaving
only a small space open towards the North-east. About eighteen hundred paces may be
the compass of it; for six hundred whereof it lies on the Sea-coast, enclosed with a good
Wall, as likewise on the River-side, which bounds another third of the Town; and on
the Land-side, 'tis fortified with four regular Bastions. The first, which is on the Riverside,
is called the Bastion of Saint Domingo; another on the Sea-shore, Saint Iago; and
two more betwixt these two, called Madre de Dios and Vnze mil Vergenes: from that of
Saint Iago, to that of Madre de Dios, there is a good Pallisado of eighteen foot high??? and
between those of Madre de Dios to Saint Domingo, a sufficient Ditch. The Colledge of
the Iesuits, also called Saint Pauls, which serves likewise for a Parish Church, stands on the
top of the Hill, whence it commands the Town, and the Country near about it. There
is likewise another rising ground about a Cannon shot from the City, where there is a Convent
of Iacobins. The River there, which runs North-west, is not very broad, and at
high-water it mixes with the Sea, but is fresh at low-water. There is a Bridge over it,
though one side is without comparison much higher then the other, by reason the Land,
South-east, is so low and marshy, that it cannot be broken, but water comes in immediately,
and in some places 'tis absolutely drown'd. No week passes but it rains two or three
times, unless it be in Ianuary, February, and March. The Ebb there leaves open above two
thousand paces of shore, which being nothing but a deep mud, affords no landing at lowwater.
               Before the City lye two Islands; one the Portuguez call Ilha da Naos, about a Canonshot
distant from the City, the other, Ilha de Pedra, for the Quarries where they get Freestone
for their building, and lyes something more remote. The Caracks and Gallions cast
Anchor betwixt these Islands at four or five fathom water, but Frigots and Barks enter the
River, and Vessels of a middle rate shelter under the Ilha da Naos, between the River and
the City.
               In the City of Malacca, its Suburbs, and the neighbouring Towns, possessed by the Portuguez,
there may be about twelve thousand Inhabitants, thus accounted; in the Parish of
Saint Thomas, in the place they call Camp clein, a thousand; in the Suburbs towards the
River eighteen hundred: in the Parish of Saint Lawrence two thousand; and in Senhora
Nossa de Pidaede as many; in Nossa Senhora da Guadalupe, five Leagues thence, about seven
or eight hundred; and within the walls of the City, three thousand, making at most not
above three thousand fighting men. Amongst them there are not above three hundred
natural Portuguez, the greatest part are Mestizes or Malyans.
               
               The City is so commodiously scituate for Commerce with China and the Moluques,
whereof the Portuguez having experience, to hinder other Nations from footing there,
gave out, that the Air was unwholsome, that it was not inhabitable, especially for Forraigners,
while they notwithstanding continued there, and followed their business.
               They are possessed of no more then the City and Suburbs, and five Leagues off, upon the
same River, the Town of Nostra Senhora de Guadalupe; for about half a League thence
live the Manancambos, Subjects to the King of Iahor: but that would not have hindred
the Portuguez from making it one of the most considerable places of the Indies, if the
Hollanders did not disturb their Commerce, and find work for the King of Spain's Armies
in that part of the Universe. At the request of the King of Iahor, in the year 1606.
they came down into Malacca, and besieg'd the chief City, upon promise they should be
possest of it; but the aid that King brought them was so inconsiderable, that they were
constrain'd to raise the Siege; yet not till they had so ruin'd the place, that it could never
since be repaired, six thousand lives being lost in the Siege. On the other side, since the
Hollanders got such strong hold in Ceylon and Iava, the Portuguez trade with China and
the Moluques is quite lost, by reason they are no more Masters of that Sea. But what more
and more ruines the City, is the avatice of the Governours, who will not accept
of that Government, but on condition to inrich themselves two hundred thousand
Crowns in three years: to raise which sum they are forc'd to oppress the Inhabitants as
well as Strangers; which oppressions will in time so ruine the Commerce of this place,
that for the future the Portuguez must make no great account of it.
               The Kingdom of Patana is not so great as that of Iahor,Patana. but without comparison more
populous: for some that have dealt there for the Hollanders, and have staid there a sufficient
time, affirm, they have seen Records, that assert the King of Patana can raise an Army
of an hundred and fourscore thousand men. True it is, the Patanans are bad Souldiers,
and very improper for war; but we speak of the number, not the quality, and say, that
the City of Patanan, the Metropolis of the Kingdom, can alone set forth at least ten
thousand; that is, the Malayans four thousand, the Chineses three, and the Siameses as
many.
               The City of Patana stands upon the Sea-side,Description of Patana??? but the Haven is two thousand paces
thence. The Houses are of Timber or Canes, and well and handsomly built. The Kings
Palace is surrounded with a Pallisado, and the Mosquey is made of Brick.
               As to the Inhabitants,Its Inhabitants. they may be said rather brown then Olive-coloured; of body
well proportioned, but they are haughty and proud; yet this rather in their Comportment
then Conversation, wherein they are very affable: for the Queen her self admitted
the Hollanders to come into her Bark with her Noble men, and excused it, that the
severity their Sex observe, neither permitted her to see them more often, nor to admit them
to her Retirement, to which she was oblieged since here Widowhood.
               The Chineses and Siameses, who have lived any time there, are ingenious, and understand
Navigation; but the Malayans meddle only with Husbandry and Fishing, living miserably,
and drinking nothing but Water. They have no liking to Wine, and for Arac and
Aquavitae they have an aversion: but Women they love, and prefer that pleasure before
all others, wherefore there is not a Man, who, besides four or five lawful Wives, hath not as
many Concubines.
               Simple ornication they allow of, and hold it no sin; but Adultery they punish severely.
This is a Crime unpardonable, and for which the Father, or Son, or one of the nearest Relations,
is obliged to be Executioner, the manner of death being left to the person guilty;
yet is this Crime so common, that they would dispeople the Country, should they punish all
that are guilty of it.
               Their wealth consists in Land and Slaves, whom they feed with nothing but Rice, and a
little Fish, yet make great profit out of their labour. Only the Chineses and the Mestizes
betake themselves to any Trade, or apply themselves to Traffick, which they chiefly have
in Siam, Burdelon, Lugor, Cambodia, Cochinchina, Macasser, Grece, Pahan, Iambi, Iohor,
Bantam, Bandar, Malfin, Suchidanar, and other places upon the same Coast or Countrey,
where they carry all sorts of China Commodities, Purcelane, Skins, Pots, Kettles, and
other Iron Utensils; as likewise Flesh powder'd and smoak'd, Fish dry and salted, Cloath
which they have from the Hollanders and Chineses. From their Neighbours they fetch
Timber to build withall, Rottang, that is, Cordage of Cocoe, Oyle of the same, Fruits dry'd
and preserv'd, Skins of Neat, Buffles, Goats, Pepper, and particularly a Drug they call Saroyboura.Swallows nests.
These are only Swallow-nests, which they find on Rocks by the Sea-side, and are
of such esteem in China, that they sell them for three or four Crowns the pound. There
are two sorts of them, the white, which are much in request, and are sold for six, seven,

or eight Campans the China Catti; but the grey are not so dear, and not worth three or
four Campans the Catti, which amounts not to above eleven Sols, or a Mamide of
Cambaya.
               Though the Country lye not far from the Equinoctial,The Air of Patana. yet is the Air good and wholsom,
though the heats are exceeding great. Summer begins there in February, and lasts to
the end of October; there falls continual Rains during November, December and Ianuary,
with a North-west wind. They Till the Earth with Oxen and Buffles, and sow nothing
but Rice, of which they get great abundance. They have for every moneth several
Fruits, and Hens that lay twice a day, by reason whereof the Country abounds in all sorts
of provisions for the belly, as Rice, Oxen, Goats, Geese, Ducks, Hens, Capons, Peacocks,
Deer, Hares, Coneys, Fowl and Venison, and specially in Fruits, whereof they have above
a hundred several sorts; as Durians, Mangosthans, Annas, Lanciats, Ramboutammas, Pissans,
Oranges and Lemmons, and above all Lemmons gibol, called in France China Oranges,
bought there five or six hundred for a Campan; Mamplans, Batians, and Centals, &c.
whereof more hereafter.
               The Inhabitants breed no Swine,Mahumetans. but the Forrests are so full of wild ones, that they are
forc'd to hunt them to prevent the destruction of their Rice; which being taken, they
bury them in the ground, as being Mahumetans, and eat none themselves, nor suffer
others.
               In the Forrest likewise there are abundance of Tygers and Apes, which are no less pernicious
to the Fields then the wild Swine are; but the wild Elephants, of which there are
likewise great numbers, are very harmless. They are taken by hunting, turning a tame
Elephant amongst them, with whom they presently fight, and while they are in the fury
they tye their hinder feet together; so as being not able to withstand any longer, they
yield to be driven away, and are tam'd by hunger in a short time.
               The Portuguez heretofore bought there fifteen or sixteen horned Beasts in a year, and
carried them to Malacca, paying a Campan a head for the export. But the Hollanders pay
nothing, neither for those they slaughter in the Country, nor for those they ship for Sumatra
or Iava: for doubtless they win more on their affections then the Portuguez, or any
other Strangers.
               The King of Patana is Subject, or rather Vassal to the King of Siam, but payes him annually
a very inconsiderable Tribute. Not many years since there reign'd a Queen, that
sent him no more then once a year a Flower of Gold, and some Silk-Stuffes and Scarlet;
she was about that time fifty years of age, whereof she had been a Widow fifteen; when
she appear'd abroad, which was seldom, to take the Air, she was attended by four thousand
Persons of Quality, with the Armes and Equipage of her deceased Husband born before
her.
               The King of Iohor possesses all the utmost parts of the Penninsula,Johor. the Ancients called
Aurea Chersonesus, to the Streight of Sincopura, the chief Towns are Linga, Bintam, Caryman,
&c. but the chief City of all the Country is Batusabar, scituate six Leagues from
the Sea, upon the River Iohor, divided into two Towns, one keeping the name of Batusabar,
the other called Cottasabrang, one being thirteen hundred paces about, the other about
five hundred. They are both built with Free-stone, and all the Houses stand along the
River-side, raised on piles eight or ten foot from the ground, which lies so low, that at
high-water 'tis covered twice a day. In it are near four thousand Inhabitants able to
bear Armes; and could they bring themselves to take pains in Fortification, with little
labour might this River be brought about the Town, which might thus be made one
of the strongest places in the Indies. The Hollanders have used all their Endeavour to
bring them to it, and to secure themselves from the Portuguez, their irreconcileable
Enemy: but their Houses in Cotta Zabrang, and thereabouts, being nothing but
Straw, they care not much for burning, so they have but time to save themselves in Batusabar,
where the building is of Timber, and they can defend themselves against flying
parties.
               The Country belongs intirely to the King,The soyl fertile. who gives Land to manure to any that desire
it; but the Malayans are so slothful, that the Ground is all, as it were, overgrown with
Moss, though by the Herbage and Trees it produces, it is easie to perceive, great profit
might be raised, if the Soyl were cultivated. For further testimony of this, the Hollanders,
in their Relations, amongst other things observe, that at a time the King of
Iohor presented their Admiral with Sugar Canes eighteen foot long, and seven inches
about.
               The Malacca or Malayan Language is held the most elegant of all the Indies, where it is
at least as general as French in Europe, and is the easier to learn, because there are no inflections,

neither in Nounes nor Verbs. For the Readers curiosity I shall here insert some of
their words, that he may spend his judgment, and begin with the numbers, which they
thus count.

               Leaving the firm Land and the Peninsula,Sumatra. by the Ancients called Aurea Chersonesus, on
the Coast of Malacca; we find the Isle of Sumatra, not above ten Leagues distant. Some
have said 'twas rent from the Continent by the Sea Currents, as Ceylon from that part of
the Indies heretofore called India intra Gangem, but for this conjecture there is little ground
in History, it being not to be affirmed more of this place, then it can of Sicily, or England,
or any other Island in the World; except we shall presuppose, that at the Creation the Sea
compassed the whole Earth, and that then there was no Islands, but that they were made
by the Sea, which afterwards by degrees form'd them out of the firm Land. To enter
into this dispute is not our design, no more then to decide whether Sumatra were the ancient
Taprobane, as Ios. de l' Escale, Mercator, and divers others think; or Ophir, where
King Solomon's Ships fetch'd the Gold and other precious things, as the Scripture sayes;
but we shall recite only what we could gather out of these last Relations.
               All conclude that Sumatra extends from the fifth degree on this side, to the sixth degree
beyond the Line; by which Rule it should contain a hundred and sixty, or a hundred
sixty five Leagues in length, with a breadth of sixty; and so they who inhabit the middle
of the Island, to have the Equinoctial Line perpendicularly over them. By the scituation
we may judge the heats to be there extream; and herewithall there is so much Wood, and
such a multitude of Lakes, that the Air, especially for Strangers, is exceeding unhealthful.
Nevertheless it is abundantly fertile;The Riches. and besides Gold, Silver, and divers other Metals, as
Copper, Iron, Brass, whereof they have the Art to make as good Artillery as they do in
Europe; it produces Rice and Millet, particularly Fruit, in such quantity, as the Forrests
are loaden with it, and sufficiently furnish all the Inhabitants. In the middle of the Isle
there is a burning Mountain, flaming by intermissions, as Vesuvius in the Kingdom of Naples;
and, they report, there is a Balsom Fountain running incessantly. 'Tis wealthy in
Diamonds and other precious Stones, Silks, Spices, Wax, Honey, Camphire, Cassia, and divers
other Drugs used in Medicine. There are whole Woods of white Sandale, and Cotton
sufficient to cloath the Inhabitants.
               This Island was heretofore divided into ten Kingdoms,Contains many Kingdoms. but Men making this Voyage
only for Traffick, they are contended to visit those only next the Sea, and omit to travel further
into the Country, where doubtless Riches are to be found unknown to the maritime
Inhabitants. The Portuguez give us account only of two Mediterranean Kingdoms, which
they call Andragidan and Arunau; as also those of Achim, Pedir, Pacem, Camparam, Znde
and Mancabo, all on the Sea-side, and on this side the Line. The Hollanders, for advance of
their Commerce in the Isle of Iava, have discovered the Kingdom of Polymbam beyond
the Line, and have made there a most firm establishment, as may be seen in their Relations.
The Portuguez have there nothing at all, but have freedom of Trade, except hindred by
the Hollanders.
               The King of Achim hath united to his Crown the Kingdoms of Pedir and Pacem,King of Achim??? with
almost all the Northern Coast of the Isle; but he that reigned there in 1596. when the
Hollanders first sailed into those parts, was a Fisher-man that usurp'd the Crown, and, in the
Siege of Polymbam, was slain, leaving only one Son of five moneths of age, under the

government of his Father in Law. Which young Prince dying, his Grandfather
succeeded to the Crown; and that was he the Hollanders treated with in the year
1668.
               The City of Achim stands in a wide Plain upon the side of a very broad River,The Town of Achim. but so
shallow, that the least Boats get in with difficulty. It hath neither Gates nor Walls, the
Houses all built on piles, and covered with Coco-leaves. The Castle, or Palace Royal, stands
in the middle of the Town, which on two sides hath most excellent pleasant Forrests, well
stored with Apes, Herns, and all manner of Birds.
               The Natives are flat-fac'd,The Inhabitants. and of an Olive colour, they cover their body with a Cotton
or Silk Shirt, and their head with a light Turbant of the same stuffe; Children go stark
naked, only Girls have their secret parts hidden with a Silver-plate. The Inhabitants of
Guzuratta, Malabar, Negupatam, Bengalan, and Pegu, and all Strangers that live among
them, cloath themselves after the same manner.
               The Castle is fortified with a good Wall and Pallisado, and well flanked, so as the Artillery
commands all the Avenues and streets of the Town. The Houses in the Castle are
built of the same matter and same form of those of the Town, by reason the River, which
often overflows, drowns them sometimes to the first story. The piles that support them
are gayly wrought, and the Houses covered with Canes. They enter into the Castle by
seven Gates, one within another, which are neither curious nor strong. Without the
Kings special Licence, none but the Life-guard and Women enter the Pallisado, all others
must sue for Audience, or expect till the King sends for them. Such as present themselves
to him, do him reverence, with their hands joyn'd and lifted above their head, crying,
Daula tuacon, that is, Long live the King. He never recreates himself but with Women,
or appears in publick, but either to see Cock-fighting, to bathe in the River, or hunt the
Elephant. He is serv'd only by Women or Eunuchs. He uses his Subjects as slaves, and
governs by four Sabanders, who are next in authority to him. His Laws are fevere, and
punishments extreamly cruel; so as one shall there meet a multitude of people without
either hands or feet, and have been so mutilated, for miscarriages not worth the name of
Crimes.
               The King of Achim,Religion. as almost all that inhabit the Coast of Sumatra, is a Mahumetan;
for which reason I shall not need to say any more of their Religion; only, that they begin
their Lent with the new Moon in the twelfth moneth, and end it, at the new of the next
moneth, observing abstinence all day, during that time, till night. Whence it comes, that
their impatience to see the end of their Lent, makes them still gaze in the West, fixing their
eyes up to the Heavens, to find the new Moon; which is no sooner seen, but they fall to
feasting and jollity for the remainder of that night.
               In Sumatra they get no Corn,Their Victuals. but Rice sufficient, of which the Inhabitants make good
varieties, particularly Cakes with Oyl; they have plenty likewise of Beef and Buffles,
Goat and Mutton, though none but the King hath priviledge to breed Sheep. Oranges???
Lemmons, Bonana, Tamarindes, Batalas, Reddish, Sprinage, and Lettice in great abundance;
they drink Water, or Arac made of Rice or Cocoes.
               There is in Sumatra a Tree, in the Malayan Language called Singadi; in Arabia, Gurae;
the Canarians call it Parizaticco;The mournful day-tree. the Persians and Turks, Gul; the Decanins, Pul; and the
Portuguez, Arbor triste de dia. It puts forth an infinite number of branches very small
and full of knots, from every knot comes two leaves like a Plumb-leaf, save that they are
as sweet as Sage, and are covered with a beautiful white. Every leaf hath its bud, which
opening thrusts forth small heads, whereof each hath four round leaves, and from each
head comes five flowers, composing as it were a Nosegay, in such manner as the fifth is
seen in the middle of the rest. The flowers are white as Snow, and a little bigger then
the Orange-flower; blows immediately as the Sun is set, so suddenly, that they are produced
as 'twere in the cast of an eye. This fecundity lasts all night, till the return of the
Sun makes both the flowers and leaves drop off, and so strips the tree that least greenness
is not to be found upon it, nor any thing of that admirable odour which perfum'd the
Air, and comprehended all that Asia affords of sweetness. The tree keeps in this condition,
till the Sun hath left the Horizon; and then it begins to open its womb again, and deck
it self with fresh flowers, as if in the shades of night it would recover it self out of the
affliction which it is put into by that Planet, whose return enlivens the rest of the Universe.
               There is not in the Island a Tree more common then the Cocoes,Cocoes. and in regard 'tis general
through the Indies, I will give here a brief description of it; and first tell you there are
four sorts thereof. That which bears the fruit called Cocoes, which are the Nuts of the
Country, is the most considerable, not only of any Tree in this Country, but indeed of any

other part of the world. This Tree, not above a foot diameter, grows in body exceeding
high, having not a branch but at the top, where it spreads as the Date-tree. The fruit
comes not out of the branches, but beneath out of the body, in bunches or clusters of ten
or twelve Nuts: The flower is like that of a Chesnut, and it grows only near the Sea, or
upon the River side in sandy ground, and nevertheless grows so lofty, that except the Indians,
who by practice climb it with as much agility and quickness as an Ape, there is no
Stranger will venture to do it. 'Tis as common in the Indies, as the Olive in Spain, or
Willows in Holland; and though the wood be sappy, yet it serves for such variety of things,
that there is no Tree of so general an use.Ships made of it, as also Sails, Cables, &c. In the Maldives Isles, they make Ships that
cross the Sea, without any thing but what the Cocoe affords. Of the outer rind they make
a kind of Hemp, which they call Cayro, whereof they make Cordage and Cables for their
Ships. Of the leaves they make Sails, and cover Houses with them; they make of them
likewise Umbrelloes, Fans, Tents, Mats and Hats, which for their lightness are very commodious
in Summer.
               These Trees are planted either for the Fruit, or the Terry which is got out of them.
The Fruit is of the bigness of an Estridge egg; and the Husk, that is green, as of our
ordinary Nuts, being dried, is converted into the Thread called Cayro, which I spoke of
before. Sometimes they gather the Fruit before it comes to perfect maturity, and then
it is called Lanbo, whence may be drawn two pints of refreshing Liquor pleasant to
drink. This Juyce by degrees turns to a little Nut, in taste not much unlike our Haselnut,
but something sweeter. The shell of this Nut, while 'tis green, is good to eat, but
being dry, they make Cups, Spoons, and other Utensils of it, or make Coal for Goldsmiths.
The Indians peel this Nut, and extract a Milk out of it, as useful to all purposes,
as our Cows milk. None but the poor eat the Fruit, because ordinarily they dry it, to extract
the Oyl, which is good to eat, useful in medicine, and to burn in Lamps. The fruit
being kept in the shell, by degrees turns to a kind of Apple, which in time grows yellow,
and is excellent to eat.
               They extract Wine out of it, thus;How they make Wine. pulling off the Flower, they fasten to it a pot of
Earth they call Collao, well stop'd and luted with Potters earth, that it may not dye nor
sharpen. They know in what time the pot will be filled with a certain Liquor, which
they call Sura, that hath the taste and quality of Whey. This Liquor boyl'd makes Terry,
which serves them for Wine, and being set in the Sun, makes excellent Vinegar, and stilling
it in a Limbeck makes good Strong-water. They make likewise Sugar of it, which they
call Iagra, but esteem it not, for that 'tis brown, having such plenty of white. The Portuguez,
steeping Raisins of the Sun and some other Ingredients in Sura, make a Drink that
hath the taste and quality of Sack.
               The Indians esteem most the inside of this Tree,Paper of this Tree. for the Pith is white, and as fine as
any Paper we have, will hold in fifty or sixty folds, or as many leaves. They term it Olla,
and use it in stead of Paper, so as Persons of Quality seek much after it, only for this use;
of the Bark they make courser paper, to make up Merchandizes in.
               The second Species of Cocoes, is the Tree that the Portuguez call Arrequeiro, for the
Areca that comes of it, whereof we spoke in the precedent Book, and of which we shall
have further occasion to speak more hereafter; as well as of the other two kinds, called
Tamor and Lantor, in the description of the Isle of Iava, to which we shall come immediately.
               Bananas is not any where so common as in Sumatra:Bananas. 'tis a kind of Indian Fig-tree,
which grows to a mans height, and produces Leaves six foot long, and a foot and half
broad. We call it, with the Portuguez, the Fig-tree, in regard that though the Fruit be
not altogether like other Figs, yet hath it the shape and colour. It may be called rather a
Bush then a Tree, because it hath no body. The Leaves begin to break forth when the
Sprout is but four foot high, and as some come forth, others wither and fall, till the Plant
be at full growth, and the Fruit come to maturity. The bole of it is not above ten or twelve
inches think, and so soft that it may with ease be cut with a Knife. In the middle of the
Leaf there comes out a Flower as big as an Estridge Egg, inclining to a violet colour, out of
which comes a branch which is not wood, but tender as a Cabbage-stalk, loaden with Figs.
At first they are no bigger then a Bean, but in time they grow seven or eight inches long,
and as big as a Cowcumber; not a sprig but shall have near a hundred Figs, which joyn together
like a bunch of Grapes. They gather them before they are full ripe, which they
know by their colour, which is of a yellowish green; then they hang them on a Nail till
they ripen, which will be in four or five days. No stalk hath more then one bunch; they
cut it close to the ground, whence it springs again with such vigout, that in a moneth it recovers
its former condition; and at that rate fructifies the year throughout, which is a great

Mana to this Country, where a little sufficeth; and thus they live in a manner for nothing.
The Cods or Husks, wherein the Figs are inclosed, are no less delicious and useful then the
Fruit it self, and as nourishing as our finest Bread, and in taste much like a Cake, so as this
Tree alone is sufficient to feed the whole Country.
               The Pepper of Sumatra is without doubt the best in the Indies,Pepper. except that of Cochim.
Commonly they plant it at the root of another Tree, underset it with Canes or Poles, as
Hop or French-beans. The Leaves resemble Orange-leaves, only they are a little less and
more sharp; it grows in little branches as red Goosberries, or Juniper. While it hangs on
the tree it is green, and turns not black till it be gathered and dry, which they do in December
and Ianuary. The places which produce most of it are, Malabar, Onar, Barselor, Mangalor,
Calicut, Cranganor, Cochim, Conhon, Quida, Dampin, Dedir, Campir and Andragir,
the Isles of Sumatra and Bantam, and certain places in the Isle of Iava. They bring forth
likewise white Pepper, but not in so great abundance. The Malayans call Pepper Lauda;
the Inhabitants of Iava, Sahargh; and the Malabars, Molanga. Long Pepper is not gotten
but in Bengala, which is another sort of Fruit like the tag of a point, but something
thicker and gray, containing a small white grain of the same taste and use as common Pepper.
In Malabar and Goa there grows another sort of Pepper, which they call Canarius,
but used only by poor people.
               'Tis something strange, but very certain, that they spend more Pepper in the Indies then
is brought into Europe; though in the Haven of Bantam only, 'tis known they have laded
fourty eight thousand Bags in a year: for the Indians dress not any meat without handfuls
of it, but they never beat it, nor grind it.
               Iava,Java. an Island commonly called Iava Major, to distinguish it from another less of the
same name, which lies hard by it, is South-East from the Isle of Sumatra, from which it is
dis-joyned, only by a narrow Streight, called the Streight of Sunda. It lies seven Degrees
beyond the Line, and is about fifty Leagues long: but hitherto no mans curiosity hath
discovered the breadth of it, which makes some conceive that it is not an Island, but part
of the Continent, known by the name of Terra Australis, near the Streight of Magellan.
Iulius Scaliger, in his Exercitations against Cardan, calls it the Compendium of the World;
because there is not Animal, Plant, Fruit, Metal, nor Drug, which is not here in greater
abundance, then in any part of the Universe.
               The Natives say,Inhabitant. that originally they came from China, and that their Ancestors, weary
of the yoak that King kept them under, removed to the Isle of Iava; certainly they are
in face like the Chineses, their forehead and brows large, and eyes narrow; for which reason
divers Chineses settle in this Island.
               There is scarce a Town in Iava but hath a particular King, who not above forty or
fifty years since obeyed all one Emperour, but of late they have shaken off that Soveraignty,
and are all independent. The King of Bantam is the most puissant,The King of Bantam. and next him the
King of Palambuam, from whom is denominated the Streight that divides the Isles
Iava and Bali. Ten Leagues thence, towards the North-East, lyes the Town of Panarucan,
where they drive a great trade with the Slaves they bring from Malacca, as also in
long Pepper and Womens Garments.
               Near Panarucan there is a Mountain of Sulphur, which began in the year 1586. to cast
up fire in such violence,A flaming Mount. that at that first blazing above ten thousand persons perished by it.
The Kings of Panarucan and Palambuam are Pagans, but the King of the City of Passaruan,
six Leagues from Panarucan, is a Mahumetan. At Passaruan they have a great traffick
in Garnitre, a fruit like a Raspberry, whereof the Merchants of Quilin make Beads
and Bracelets, which they sell, and put off all over the Indies.
               Ten Leagues thence Westward lies the City Ioartam,Joartam. with an excellent Haven upon a
fair River, where Ships, in their Voyage from the Moluccoes to Bantam, take in Provisions
and fresh Water.
               Upon the same River lies the City Gerrici,Gerrici. to whose King the other Kings of Iava render
the same respect, they again exact from their own Slaves, and near to these two Cities
it is they fetch the Salt that is brought to Bantam.
               The City of Surabaia,Surabaia. that stands next in rank, hath likewise its proper King, who also
reigns over the City of Brandam, six Leagues thence towards the West, and lives at Cidaye.Cidaye.
               
               This City is fortified with a good Wall well flanked; but the Haven is not safe, by
reason there wants shelter against the Winds that come from Sea-wards.
               Ten Leagues Westward lies the City of Tabaon,Taboan. next Bantam, the most considerable of
the Island, as we shall tell you anon.
               Five Leagues further North-west is Cajam,Cajam. a City of no traffick, no more then Mandalicaon,
which is inhabited by none but Fishermen.
               
                  
Five Leagues onwaads West stands Iapara,Japara. upon a skirt of Land that thrusts it self
three Leagues into the Sea. The scituation of this Town is upon a fair River, with a
good Harbour that renders it very Merchantile. This hath likewise a peculiar King, and
none of the meanest in the Island.
               Twenty five Leagues from Iapara, and forty five from Bantam, lies Matram, or Matavam,Matram or Matavam.
a great City, with a King of its own; who heretofore was so powerful as that he
pretended to Soveraignty over the whole Isle; and for this was the declared enemy of the
King of Bantam.
               Then five Leagues West from Iapara is the City of Pati,Pati and Dauma. and three Leagues beyond that
of Dauma, which acknowledges the King of Matavam; as doth also that of Taggal,Taggal. scituate
with the two others in the same Bay.
               The next is the fair and strong City of Charabaon, upon a fresh-water River; and onwards
the Cities of Dormago and Monucaon,Monucaon. whence they pass through the Village Gaccon,
to the City of Iacatra,Jacattra. and so to Bantam.Bantam.
               
               Without question this last is the Metropolis, and most considerable City of all Iava,
scituate about twenty five Leagues from the Isle of Sumatra, at the foot of a Mountain,
whence three Rivers rise, two whereof run by the walls, the other through the City, but
all too shallow for Navigation. The Town is indifferent great, but rascally Houses; the
walls, which are of Brick, and three foot in thickness, are not entirely lined with Earth, yet
so flanked, that at every hundredth pace lies a Cannon, which would sufficiently secure the
Curtain, were it in condition for service; but their Artillery is not mounted, and they
have no other Ammunition then a little Powder brought from Malacca, where the Portuguez
have a Mill. The City Gates are so wretched, that one might beat them down with
a Club; but so vigilantly guarded, 'twould be hard to approach without notice; there
are neither Bastions nor Towers, but in lieu thereof Scaffolds of three stories, which yield
a strong defence.
               In the whole City there are but three principal Streets,The Kings Palace. which all abut upon the Castle
called Pacebam. The one goes from the Pacebam to the Haven; another, where the
Slaves and the Kings Domesticks inhabit, leads to the Gate towards the Fields; and the
third, to the Gate at the foot of the Mountain. The Streets are not pav'd, but are as commodious,
by means of the Sand they are covered with. The Channels, which in divers
places cross the City, are foul and stinking, by reason the Stream of the River not being
strong enough to carry away the filth it brings it self, and what is thrown forth, the Water
choaks and makes puddles that infect the whole City. No Person of Quality who hath
not his private Chappel, or Mesquite, in his House; but one there is in common, near
the Palace, on the Magazine and Stable side. The City is divided into several Posts,
each of which is assign'd to some Person of Quality, who commands in time of War,
and hath the direction in civil Affairs.A Drum for a Clock. They have a Drum as big as those Germane
Casks, call'd Thunder-bolts, used instead of a Bell, which they beat with a wooden
Bar as big as a Weavers-beam, morning and evening, as also on Alarms. Likewise
they have Brass basins, which they beat musically and chime upon, as they do on
Bells.
               At every corner of the Streets there stands a Guard,The Guard of the town. and at Sun-set they draw up and
make fast all Passage-boats, so as in the night there is no stirring in the Street. At the
Prison gate, near the Palace, stands a Guard of fifty Men; nor is there a Person of Quality,
who hath not one of ten or twelve at his House. The Town is full of Cocoe-trees,
nor is there a Mansion without divers belonging to it. The housing is poorly built, of
Straw or Reeds upon piles, made like those at Achim. They cover their Houses with Cocoe-leaves,
and the sides of thier lodging Rooms have only Curtains for freedom of the Air,
which is exceeding necessary in this hot Climate. For preservation of their Wares, they
have Store-houses of Stone, but they are covered only with Straw, so that to secure them
from fire, which is but too frequent amongst them, they lay great pieces of Timber over
the Roof, and cover it with Sand, that the fire may not find passage. The Rooms in their
Houses are only divided by partitions, made of Canes called Bambus, which they slit so
thin, that a Horse-load serves for all the Rooms in a House. At the Houses of Persons of
Quality, at the first entrance, you come into a square Court, where the Guard is, and where
the Master of the House speaks with such as have business with him, under a little Shed,
covered with Canes or Cocoe-leaves. In one of the corners of this Court stands the Mesquite,
where at noon they do their Devotions, and not far thence the Cistern where they
wash themselves. Being entred the House, you find on both sides of a narrow Gallery several
little Niches, for Slaves to rest in, who watch for their Masters security; by reason
they are all afraid of being surprized and killed by their Enemies in the night. All Forraigners,

as the Inhabitants of Bengala, Guzuratta, Malayans, Abissins, Chineses, Portuguez
and Hollanders, lye out of Town.
               Here are three great Market places,Market places. where Merchants meet daily; The grand Bazar, or
Exchange, is towards the East part of the Town, and is the meeting place of forreign
Merchants; as Portuguez, Arabians, Turks, Chineses, Quilins, Peguans, Malayans, Bengalans,
Gusurats, Malabars, and other Indians, who are there from the break of the day
till nine of the clock, and then break up. The second Market place is before the great
Mesquite, divided from it by a Pallisado. To this place Women resort with Sacks, and a
weight of three pounds, they call Gantam, who buy Pepper of the Country people, at eight
or nine hundred Caxas the Gantam. But the Chineses, who are very skilful in this Trade,
forestall them sometimes; for they go to the Peasants and buy all they have by the lump
before hand. Betwixt the Pallisado and the Mesquite stand Women that sell Bettele,
Araca, Bananas, Melons, &c. and some there are sell fine Cakes to be eaten hot.
               A little higher on the right hand are Armourers,Armourers. who sell small pieces of Cannon, Pistols,
Sword-blades, Battle-axes, Knives, &c. Not far thence, there are others that sell
Sandal-wood, white and yellow, and on the left hand are Confectioners, that sell Sugar,
Honey, and all sorts of Sweet-meats liquid or dry. Near to that is the Bean-market, where
are sold all sorts of Beans, black, white, red, yellow, green and grey, at three hundred Caxas
the Gantam. Next to this is the Onyon-market, where Merchants that sell Cloath by
whole-sale come, and such as deal in return of Money, and assurances of the return of Vessels.
Hard by this is the Poultry, where, besides tame Fowl, they sell also Kids, Geese,
Pigeons, Parrats, &c. Coming thence you meet three wayes; one going to the Chineses
Shops; another to the Herb and Pulse-market; and the third to the Shambles. By the
way to the Chineses Shops, on the right hand, are some Jewellers, who for the greater part
are Choroacones, that is, Persians, or Arabians, who sell Rubies, Hiacinths, Turquesses, Granats,
&c. And on the left hand is the place for the Bengalians, with their Toyes and small
Wares.
               On the backside of this Street, the Chineses sell their Silks raw and colourd, Damask,
Velvet, Sattins, Brocadoes of Gold and Silver, Purcelane, and Cabinets, and works of
Lacque, &c. By the way to the Hearb-market, upon the right hand upon the Strand, are
the Bengalians with their small Wares. On the left hand Merchants of Linnen-cloath,
and at the lower end of this Market married Women have Seamsters shops; but men are
forbidden to come there under pain of a forfeiture. Then you come to the Hearb-market,
where are a multitude of Simples unknown to us. Turning thence you see the Fish-market,
then the Shambles, with Stalls full of Beef, Buffles and Venison: then the Spice-market,
where Women sell Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, &c. and all sorts of Gums and
Drugs, to Europeans unknown: and the Rice-market, where likewise they sell Earthen-Ware
and Salt; whence they pass by the same way they came, to the place where Merchants
and Masters of Ships meet about their Affairs.
               The sale of these Commodities lasts but till nine of the clock, and then opens the Market
before the Pacebam, or Palace Royal, where are sold all sorts of Victuals, as likewise
some Pepper, which they truck with the Chineses. About noon the Market in the Chineses
quarters begins, where nothing is sold but for the Table.
               We told you before, that next Bantam, Tuban or Tubaon,Tuban. is the chiefest Town in Iava,
and in effect, is stronger then all the rest, and although not so great as Bantam, 'tis at least
as handsome, and as well built. The Palace is exceeding spacious, and hath very fair
Appartments, where Elephants and other Beasts have their several quarters. Each Elephant
hath his lodge built upon four pillars, with a post in the middle to tye him to. The
rooms are filled with Chests and Hampers for the baggage, when the King goes his Progress.
Near to his Lodgings is a place where his fighting Cocks are kept, every one his
Pen apart, and every one his Keeper; as likewise the Parrots, which are much before those
they bring into these parts. The greatest part of a beautiful flame colour, with a great
golden spot on the back: the out-sides of their wings blew and red, and the in-side a lovely
carnation. They are too tender to indure the inconveniences of a long Voyage; besides
the Indians highly esteem them, for that they love their owners, and delight to be
made much of by them. The King of Tuban, whom the Hollanders saw, in their third
Voyage to the Indies, delighted much in these Creatures, as likewise in Dogs, Horses and
white Ducks, by much larger then ours. He had four legitimate Wives, six Sons, and
two Daughters, besides natural Children a great number by Concubines, which he kept
in several Appartments. His Bed was raised some distance from the ground, built like an
Altar of great Stones, whereon lay a Quilt and certain Pillows of Sattin, filled with raw
Silk.
               
                  
The Chief Commerce they have at Tubaon consists in Pepper, which they carry to the
Isle of Body, where they truck for Cloath, and Stuffs of Cotton and Silk, which afterwards
they bring to Banda, Ternate, the Philippines, and other parts, to truck for Cloves, Mace and
Nutmegs. The Inhabitants, for the greatest part live only on Fish. They wear no other
Garment then a Linnen-cloath about the Loyns; only persons of Quality sometimes have
loose Coats of Chamelot, which reach but to their Thighs. They are by this habit distinguished
from other persons, and by their train of Slaves, without whom they never come
abroad. They delight much in Horses, and to have their Saddles exceeding rich, which
are made like our great Saddles, and their trappings studded with Gold and Silver, striving
to appear well mounted at Assemblies, and to shew the King their horsemanship, and the
nimbleness of their Horses.
               The Inhabitants that live in the inner parts of the Isle of Iava are Pagans,The Javians, Mahumetans. and the greatest
part Pythagoreans, believing a transmigration of the Soul; for which reason they eat
neither Fish nor Flesh. Towards the South part of the Isle, there are, though but few,
some Mahumetans, as we said before, and they observe the Turkish Religion in all things,
sending for Priests to Meca.
               They observe two Fasts.Fasts. The greater of the two begins the fifth of August, and at the
beginning of this Lent it is, the Slaves renue their submission to their Master, with Ceremonies
extraordinary. For they take them by the feet, and rub them upward to the
knees; then closing their hands, they rub the head, face and neck; and then unclose them
again.
               Leut being ended,Divers Wives. they celebrate Easter, entertaining their Children and all their Domesticks
with a Dinner. There is scarce a Man in Bantam, who hath not three or four
Wives, and some have ten or twelve, besides Concubines, who wait on their Wives especially
when they go abroad. They make no difference betwixt legitimate and natural
Children. A Father hath not power to sell his Child, though he had it by a Slave.
Children go stark naked, only the Girls cover their Privities with a thin plate of Gold or
Silver.Tourg riages. They marry at the age of eight, nine, or ten years, not only to prevent the disorders
which in this hot Climate were inevitable, but because the King is Heir to all, who
dying, leave their Children under age; whom he makes his Slaves, as he doth the Widow
and Family of the deceased. The Dowry Persons of Quality give with their Daughters
consists in Slaves of both Sexes, and in a sum of Coxas, which is very considerable, when
it amounts to three hundred thousand, which is much about two Crowns and a half French
money.
               The Women appear with great decency at the marriage of their Relations, though
they use no great ceremonies. One may know the day by certain Poles which are stuck in
the Houses of the Bride and Bridegroom, with Tassels of red and white Cotton.
               Dinner ended, they bring a Horse to the Bridegroom, whereon he rides about the Town
till evening, expecting the slaves he is to have in marriage, who come commonly loaden
with Presents. None but the nearest Kindred sup with them, and see the new married couple
abed.
               Women of Quality are kept in such restraint, that they suffer not their own Sons to
come within their Chambers; and when they go abroad, which is very seldom, all give
place and respect to them, even the King himself would do it: nor dares any man speak
to a married Woman without the leave of her Husband. Women of Quality are known
from others, only by their Train; for all are dressed after the same fashion, wearing a Petticoat
of Cotton or Silk, which comes from the Breast to the mid-leg. Stockings they
have none, and go all bare-headed, tying up their Hair together on the Crown of their
Head; but when they come to Weddings, or other publick Assemblies, they wear a Coronet
of Gold, and have on their Fingers and about their Arms Rings and Bracelets. They
are so much addicted to cleanliness, that there passes not a day but they bathe themselves
three or four times. They do not their natural necessities, nor receive their benevolences
from their Husbands, but they go up to the Neck in Water to cleanse themselves: They
do no work at all, which needs be no wonder, for the Husbands themselves having imployed
two or three hours about their Merchandize, all the day after do nothing but chew
Bettele amongst their Wives, who are most sollicitous, by all the little kindnesses they can
imagine, to court their love, washing and rubbing them till they are stirr'd up to voluptuousness.
               The Magistrate of the Town of Bantam sits in Judicature in the Court of the Pacebam,Magistrate of Bantam.
from four or five in the Evening till it be Night. The Plaintiff and Defendant appear
both in person, and plead their own Cause. One only punishment of Criminals is,
they tye them to a post, and stab them to death with a Poyniard: Strangers have this priviledge,

that giving satisfaction to the party complaining, they may redeem themselves
from death, except they have murthered in cold bloud, or upon advantage.
               The Kings Council meets upon Affairs of State,The Kings Councel. under a broad spread Tree, by Moonlight,
where sometimes there come near five hundred persons, who part not till the Moon
go down. When the Council is risen they go to bed, and there lye till dinner time:
afterwards the Councellours of State give audience to all who have ought to propose to
the Councel. When the King comes there in person, he sits in the midst of them; or
else with the four principal Ministers of State, and propounds the point wherein he requireth
their advice, or causes the Governour of the Town to propound it. To a Councel
of War they call the three hundred Captains, Commanders of the Troops the Armies
consist of, which is raised in the Town it self. They have a particular course for
quenching fire, which happens but too often among them; for the Women have this Office
imposed upon them, while the Men stand in Arms to defend them in the mean time
from pillage.
               Persons of Quality,The train and state of the Nobility when they go to Court, or through the Town, have carried before
them a Lance, and a Sword sheath'd in a black Velvet Scabbard, and by these Ensigns oblige
all the Street to make way for them, who retiring back, fit on their Heels till these
Grandees are past. Their ordinary wear is of Stuff wrought with Silk, and they wear
Turbants of a fine Bengalian Cloath. Some amongst them wear Mandillions of Velvet,
black or crimson, and never forget the Dagger or Poyniard under their Girdle. They ever
go with a numerous train of Slaves; one amongst them carrying the Bettele-bottle, another
the Chamber-pot, and a third the Umbrello. They all go bare-footed, it being thought
a disparagement among them, to walk with Shooes through the Town. In their Houses
many wear them; they are made at Achim, Malacca in China, and the Isle of Sumatra,
where are also made most part of the Umbrello's used in the Indies.
               The Iavians are haughty,The qualities of the Javians. self-conceited, perfidious, mischievous, and cruel; who never
fail to make an end of such they once get advantage of; and having once committed a
murther, they kill all in their power; for knowing death to be their inevitable reward,
they discharge their fury indifferently on all they encounter, without consideration of sex
or age; so as sometimes they are constrained to kill them in the place, instead of taking
them to be delivered up into the hands of Justice.
               They generally wear long hair, are of a Chesnut Complexion, having great Jaw-bones,
flat Faces, great Eyebrows, little Eyes, thin Beards; and being of a middle stature, well set,
and strongly limb'd. They are addicted naturally to theft, and so vindicative, that to be
revenged of an Enemy, they stick not to run upon his Weapons, and hazard an assured
death, to take away anothers life.
               This bloudy disposition shews they have courage,Good Souldiers. and would make good Souldiers, were
they but as dextrous at Fire-arms as they are at their usual Weapons; which are the Pike,
the Battle-axe, and the broad Sword, but above all the Dagger, or Poyniard. Their Bucklers
are of Wood, or boyled Leather stretcht upon a Hoop; and for their bodies they have
Cuirasses, the pieces being fastned together with mails of Iron. Souldiers in time of peace
have no pay, but in time of war they have Arms and Clothes, and Rice and Fish for provision.
They are all Slaves, and not only such as belong to the King, but likewise to other
Lords, who are obliged to enroll them for their Princes service. They are seldom or never
idle, but imploy themselves most commonly in making Sheaths for Ponyards of Sandalwood
made hollow, or pollishing their Arms, which they generally poyson; keeping them
so well, that no Raizor can be sharper then their Swords. The Iavaneses, as indeed all the
rest of the Indians, hold their Daggers so dear to them, that they will not speak to any
man without that by their side, not one Brother with another, and at night they lay it under
their Bolster. Some use Truncks, through which they blow little poysoned Arrows,
so bearded, that pulling it out the head remains in the wound, which by this means becomes
incurable and mortal. Amongst such a multitude of Villains, there are notwithstanding
some honest people, but the number is very small: for except some that inhabit
near Bantam, upon the Streight of Sunda, at the foot of the mountain Gonon Besar, who
were transplanted thither from Pasaruan, all the rest are depraved. The people not able to
live under the tyranny of the King of Passaruan, put themselves on certain conditions under
the protection of the King of Bantam, and have built the Town of Sura, which hath
a peculiar King, but subordinate notwithstanding to the King of Bantam. They live very
peaceably, and persevere in the exercise of their Pagan Religion.
               The soyl is cultivated,Javians Sophuticate their wres. either by free people, who take it of the King, or other Lords,
at a certain rent, and are not bound to labour longer then their bargain, and may afterwards
do what they please; or by Slaves, who cultivate the Pepper, Rice and Cocoes, breed

Poultry and Cattle for their Masters profit, and to supply his Kitchin. Some Slaves take
the Cocoes at one thousand Caxaes the Tree. Others work by the day, and get eight hundred
Caxaes a day, which is to their Masters profit. Others are not maintain'd by heir
Masters, but serve them six dayes, and the six dayes following work for themselves, and so
get their livelyhood. The Woman slaves keep market, where they sell their Masters
Pepper, and other Commodities; or else imploy themselves in sewing, or making Cloath,
that they may not live unprofitably. When they have a mind to be eased of them, they
lead them from Port to Port,How they imploy their Slaves. and sell them to him will give most. The ordinary price
for one of an able body is five Fardos, that is about a Pistol a-piece. The Children of a
Slave belong to the Master, who disposes of them as he thinks best; but he hath not
power over the life of his Slave, without the express consent of the King or Governour.
               The Pepper which the Iavians sell to Strangers is usually mixt with Ordure, black
Sand, or Gravel, or they adulterate it some other way, either in quality or weight, as they
do all their other Commodities. They keep a trade with all the neighbouring Islands,
with notable advantage. At the Towns of Macasser and Surubya they fetch Rice, which
there they buy for one Sata de Caxa the Gantan, and sell it for double the price. At Balambuam
they buy Cocoes, a thousand Caxes the hundred, and venting them by retail at
Bantam, they sell eight Cocoes for two hundred Caxes. There they likewise buy the Oyl
of the same Fruit. At Ioartam, Gerrici Pati, and Iuama, they fetch Salt at a hundred
and fifty thousand Caxaes the eight hundred Gantans; and at Bantam, three Gantans are
worth a thousand Caxaes. They carry Salt to Sumatra, where they truck for Lacque,
Pepper, Benjamin, Cotton, Tortoise-shell, and divers others Commodities. From Iacatra,
Iappara, Crauaon, Timor and Palimbaon, they fetch Honey, Wax, Sugar, &c. Salt-fish from
Crauaon and Bendermassing; Iron from Crimata, in the Isle of Borneo; Copper and Lead
from Pepa and Guselaen, upon the Coast of Malacca; from Bali and Cambaya, Cotton and
Cotton-cloath, &c.
               Rich Merchants make no Voyages themselves, but venture the greatest part of their
money, for more or less profit, as the Voyages are long or dangerous, and near upon the like
conditions we do here in Europe. Obligations, as all other Instruments, are written upon
the bark of a Tree, the Letters ingrav'd with a Bodkin, and they make it up in a Roll, or
fold it four-square betwixt two boards, which they tye together with a Pack-thread very
neatly. Sometimes they use China Paper, which is very fine, and of all colours. As yet
they know not the Art of Printing, but they paint their own Characters exactly well,
which are rather Figures then Letters. The usual Language is peculiar to the Country;
but the Malayan is more general; the Mahumetan Religion hath likewise brought in the
Arabian Language.
               The Persians,Strongers commers there. by the Iavians called Coracons, traffick here for precious Stones, and all
sorts of Gums and Drugs, and are a people to be confided in, because they are open-hearted
and civil. The Arabians and Beguians come thither for China-ware, and bring with them
the Commodities of the neighbouring Islands. The Malayans and Quilins let their money
out at Interest, or upon change. The Guzurattans are poor, and commonly Sea-men:
All these Forreigners are attired all of one fashion, in a Cotton Garment, and a Turbant of
the same stuffe. At their coming to Bantam, they buy a Woman that is for all uses; and
at their departure thence, they sell her again; but if they have Children by her, they are
tied to provide for them.
               The Chineses are they that bring the greatest trade hither,The trade of China. the most industrious to get
wealth, and live the best. They are a self-ended people, that live by Usury, and have there
the same repute as the Iews in Europe. They go into the Country, with a weight in
hand, to buy all the Pepper they can meet with, and having weighed one parcel, so as they
may have a near guess at the rest, pay them present money, or according as they have
occasion for it, and by this means engross so great a quantity, that they have sufficient
to lade the China Fleet when it arrives, selling for fifty thousand Caxaes the
Sack, what cost them but twelve thousand. This Fleet arrives at Bantam in the moneth
of Ianuary, to the number of eight or ten, and are Vessels of fourty or fifty
Tun.
               By them likewise comes the money hither, which in the Malayan Language is called Cas,Coin of Java.
in Iavan, Pity, and is current, not only at Bantam, and all the Isle of Iava, but through
all the neighbouring Islands. 'Tis a little thin plate made of Lead, and the Skum of Brass,
so brittle, that letting fall a string of Caxaes, you shall break at least ten or twelve. They
are made in the Town of Chincoa in China, and they are beholding to Wany, King of
China, for them, who lived about the year 1590. and finding that the Caxaes made by

his Predecessour Huyien, King of China, went not off, by reason the Chineses had so filled
the adjacent Islands with them, he contrived this brittle money, which his Successour Hamendon
put forth, as now it is corrupted. It hath a four-square hole through it, at which
they string them on a Straw; a string of two hundred Caxaes, called Sata, is worth about
three farthings sterling, and five Satas tyed together make a Sapocon. The Iavians, when
this money came first amongst them, were so cheated with the Novelty, that they would
give six bags of Pepper for ten Sapocons, thirteen whereof amount but to a Crown. But
they have had leisure enough to see their error; for in a short time, the Island was so filled
with this stuffe, that they were compelled absolutely to prohibit all trading, which so disparaged
this money, that at present two Sacks of Pepper will scarce come for one hundred
thousand Caxaes.
               Likewise from China they bring Purcelane, which they sell here at cheap rates; for at
the first arrival of the China Fleet, six pieces of Purcelane may be bought for a thousand
Caxaes. They bring their Country Silks, Sattins and Damask, and take away Pepper
and Lacque, brought to Bantam from the City of Tabanbaon, Anil or Indico brought thither
from the Town of Anier, Sandal-wood, Nutmegs, Cloves, Tortoise-shell, whereof
they make Chests and Cabinets, Ivory, whereof they make Chairs for the Mandorins, who
prefer this stuffe before Silver.
               The Portuguez that deal at Bantam live out of Town,The Portuguez Commerce. in the same Quarter with the Chineses.
They drive here a great trade in Pepper, Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Sandal-woods,
Cubebs, long Pepper, and other Drugs; and sell here Cotton, Cloath, and other Stuffs, sent
them from Malacca: for the greater part of them are Factors, and Commissioners of the
Governour of Malacca, and the Arch-bishop of Goa. At Bantam they have neither Priest
nor Chappel; but at Panarucan they have both.
               In the Isle of Iava are all sorts of Beasts, both wild and tame: The Forrests are full of
Elephants and Rhinocerots, Leopards and Tigers, which are more cruel and furious then
those of any other place, and do so much mischief, that people go not without danger to
gather Frankincense, Mastick, Myrrhe and Benjamin, which is there in its greatest perfection,
and whereof there were great quantity to be gotten, if the Forrests were not almost
inaccessible, by reason of the wild Beasts, as also for Serpents, Lizards, and Salamanders,
exceeding dangerous, and of so extraordinary a growth, that there are Serpents have
swallowed Children and Sheep intire. The Tigers and Leopards often come out of
the Woods, and make great spoil amongst the Cattle, which for this reason are reared
with great difficulty. Their Swine have no bristles, and are so fat their bellies trail on the
ground.
               The Rivers breed Fish in abundance;Oysters of three hundred weight and Oysters have there been seen that have weighed
three hundred pound; a thing would seem incredible, if Olearius in his Notes upon
Mandelslo's Relation did not observe, that being in Holland in the year 1652. he ought at
Encluysen, of the Wife of a certain Sea-Captain, who had made a Voyage to the Indies, two
Oyster-shells, that weighed four hundred sixty seven pounds, yet to be seen in the Duke of
Holstein's Cabinet at Gottorp; and he adds, That the woman affirm'd there was so much
meat within them, that it sufficed all that were in the Ship, being an hundred and twenty
persons.
               'Tis very hard to hunt Deer, Goats, Boars, and other game, fallow or black, which
abound there, by reason the Woods are so thick, that 'tis impossible to make any way
through them; and the Iavians are so unskilful at their Fire-arms, that it hath been observ'd,
That a Iavian, having shot at a wild Buffler, made a shift to kill the beast; but the
Musket recoyling, he fell down, with his cheek all bruised, and the loss of two of his
teeth; in so much that these creatures may be seen in whole herds, feeding up and down
the fields. There are likewise abundance of Apes, Foins, Squirrels, wild Peacocks and
Parrots, and infinite other birds, exceeding beautiful to the eye.
               In the Rivers there is abundance of Crocodiles,Crocodiles. which seize not only on men bathing,
but attempt the Cannows, as they pass along, snatching men out of them, and dragging
them to the bottom. The Chineses tame this Creature, and fatten it, to be afterwards eaten
as a great dainty.Civet Their Civet yields as much perfume as that of Guiny; but it is neither
so white, nor so good.
               They have two sorts of Poultry,Hens. one like ours, the other betwixt ours and the Indian
kind; and these last, which are in a manner monsters, are so furious, they will fight till
death decides the battel. Amongst the common sort there are some whose flesh is black,
yet are they very good meat.
               The Rhinocerot,Rhinocerot. by the Indians called Abadu, is not so ordinary in the Isle of Iava, as
in Bengala, Patane, and other places, though there are some; and the Iavians make so great

account of this Beast, that there is nothing about him which they use not in medicine, not
only the Flesh, the Bloud, the Horn, the Teeth, but even his very Dung: They hold there
is no better Antidote against Poyson, and attribute the same qualities to this, that ancient
Authors do to the Unicorn.
               The Ants are exceeding troublesom in most of these places,Ants. but chiefly in the Isle of
Iava: They are much bigger then in our parts, and so mischievous, that there is no Stuff
they spoil not, nor Victuals they consume not, if they can get to it; wherefore they ordinarily
set the feet of Tables and Cupboards in Tubs half filled with Water, to hinder the
Ants from creeping up; and 'twere impossible to preserve any Birds, did they not set them
on Pols planted in a Dish of Water; for should they put them in a Cage, the Ants would
get up and kill them. There is besides another sort of Ants, about the length of a Mans
finger, and red; but these are only in the Fields, where they live on the barks of Trees
and Herbs.
               As concerning the Trees and Fruits in the Isle of Iava, amongst others there is the
Areca,Areca. whereof we spoke a word by the way in the precedent Book. The Portuguez call
the Tree that bears it Arre quero, the Arabians, Faufell, and Malayans, Pynang. It is a kind
of Cocoe, but not so great, nor the leaves so big and broad. The Fruit is like a Date; Nature
incloses it in a husk, which opens not till it flower, and when it ripens, the shell falls off,
the fruit remaining at the branch. It hath scarce any taste, but it moistens the mouth, dyes
the lips red, and the teeth black. The Indians lap it up in a Bettle-leaf, mix a little Chalk
or Lime with it, and chew it rather out of custom then for any pleasure, though they hold
that it strengthens the Stomach and Gums, and is a topical Medicine against the Scurvy;
and in effect there is scarce an Indian that is subject to this Disease, or troubled with the
Tooth-ach. This Drug will make some people to be drunk, that all things seem to turn
round; but that dizziness is presently over.
               The Mangas grow on Trees not much unlike our Nut-trees,Mangas. but they have not so many
leaves. They are of the bigness of a Peach, but longer, and something bending like a
Crescent, of a light green, drawing a little towards the red. It hath a great shell, that
encloses an Almond of greater length then breadth, and eaten raw very distasteful, but
roasted on the Coals not unpleasant. 'Tis useful in Physick, against the Worms, and
the Diarrhaea. It ripens in October, November, and December, and being perfectly ripe, 'tis
full as good as a Peach. They get them while they are green, and put them up in Salt,
Vinegar, and Garlick, and then they call them Mangas d' Achar, and they serve in stead
of Olives. There are likewise wild ones, which they call Mangas brauas, of a pale green
too, but brighter then the other, and full of juyce, which is immediate death without a
present Antidote.
               The Ananas is one of the loveliest,Ananas. pleasantest and wholsomest fruits of the Indies. It
grows on a bush, and hath leaves like Semper-vivum. The fruit at first is green, but being
ripe turns Orange, or Aurora coloured, drawing a little to a red, shap'd like a Pine-apple;
for which reason the Portuguez, who met with this fruit first in Brasil, called it Pinas: but
'tis tender and easie to cut. They are yellow within, of a delicate scent, they are eaten in
Wine, but the excess is dangerous for Feavers. The juyce is so sharp, that if one wipe not
the Knife they are cut with, next morning it will be found eaten. The Tree is so apt to
grow, that a sprig will take root in the earth, though it have not past two or three leaves,
be half withered, and have been cut fifteen dayes before. The Canarins call this fruit Ananasa;
the Brasilians, Nava, and in Hispaniola, and the other Western Islands, they call it
Iajama: 'tis as big as the larger sort of Lemmons, or the middle Mlons, excellent both
in scent and taste. At distance they look like Hartichoaks, only they are not so picked as
the leaves of that Plant. The stalk is like that of a Thistle, and every stalk bears but one,
and that at the top of it; for though many times it puts forth at the side other stems, yet
the fruit that comes of them is very small, and seldom comes to maturity. They have of
them in March, and then they are very pleasant, for the juyce hath the taste of sweet or
new Wine; and is exceeding easie of digestion, but it heats, and often brings a Feaver.
               In Iava there is another fruit called Samaca,Samaca. 'tis as big as a Citron, the colour green,
something drawing to a red; full of juyce, that is tart and toothsom, and within hath
divers black kernels: the leaves are like those of Lemmon-trees, but not so long. They
put them up in Salt or Sugar, and use them as Tamarindes, against burning Feavers, Inflammations
of the Breast, and pains in the Stomack, and Fluxes.
               Tamarinds grow on great Trees,Tamarind
                   full of branches, whereof the leaves are not bigger
then, nor unlike to the leaves of Pimpernel, only something longer. The flower at first is
like the Peaches, but at last turns white, and puts orth its fruit at the end of certain strings:

as soon as the Sun is set, the leaves close up the fruit, to preserve it from the Dew, and open
as soon as that Planet appears again. The fruit at first is green, but ripening it becomes of
a dark grey, drawing towards a red, inclosed in husks, brown or tawny, of taste a little
bitter, like our Prunelloes. Every husk contains three or four little Beans in a certain
skin, which is that the Portuguez call Tamarinho. The fruit is viscous, and sticks to the
fingers, but of so good a taste, that the Indians use it almost in all Sawces, as we do Verjuyce;
but 'twould turn a mans stomack to see them cook Meat with this Drug; for
squeezing it between their hands, the juyce that runs through their fingers looks more
like a Medicine then a Sawce. These Trees bear twice in the year, and grow every where
without being planted, or otherwise looked after. Physitians use this Drug against burning
Feavers, heat of the Liver, and Diseases in the Spleen, and infused a night in cold Water,
it purges gently. The Tamarinds brought to our parts, are either salted or preserved
in Sugar. The Inhabitants of the Isle of Madagascar, where there grows plenty of it,
call it Quille, and the Iavians, Sunda assu. The Portuguez gave it the name of Tamarinthes,
for the resemblance the fruit holds with the Date in Arabia, called Tamar, as if they
would say, Dates of India. The Malabars call it Puli, and the rest of the Indians, Ampuli.
The Tree is as big as a Walnut-tree, full of leaves, bearing its fruit at the branches,
like the Sheath of a Knife, but not so straight, rather bent like a Bow. The Indians,
when they would transport their Tamarinds, take them out of the husks, and
make them up in Balls as big as a Mans fist, unhandsome to look on, and worse to
handle.
               We told you before,Tabaxir. that 'tis common to plant Pepper near to a sort of Canes, by the
Iavians called Mambu, in which the Tabaxir is found. 'Tis true, in the Isle of Iava there
was never any of them found; but again 'tis certain, that on the Coast of Malabar, Coromandel,
Bisnagar, and near to Malacca, this sort of Cane produces a Drug called Sacar
Mambus, that is, Sugar of Mambu. The Arabians, the Persians, and the Moores call it Tabaxir,
which in their Language signifies a white frozen liquor. These Canes are as big as
the body of a Poplar, having straight branches, and leaves something longer then the
Olive-tree. They are divided into divers knots, wherein there is a certain white matter
like Starch, for which the Persians and Arabians give the weight in Silver, for the use they
make of it in Physick, against burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, but especially upon the
first approaches of any Disease.
               These Canes are so big,Boats of Canes. that the Indians cleave them to make Boats, leaving a knot at
each end, whereon they sit to guide it; one before, another behind, and use this sort of
Boat the rather, for that they are perswaded, Crocodiles bear a respect to the Mambu, and
never hurt the Boats made of this Cane.
               In the Isle of Iava there is another fruit,Duriaons. called, amongst the Malayans, Duriaon, not to
be seen any where but in this place and the Malaccaes. The Tree that bears them, by the
Malayans call'd Batan, is as big as our Apple-tree, the bark thick, plentiful of boughs, and
wealthy in fruit: the blossom, which they call Buaa, is white, inclining to yellow, and the
leaves half a foot in length, and two or three fingers broad, on the outside, of a pale green,
drawing towards a grey; but on the inide the green is very delicate and lively; the
fruit is as big as a Melon, covered with a thick rough rind, green, and hath ibs, as the Melon;
within 'tis divided into four quarters, which are again divided into two or three little
cells, that contain the fruit, which is as big and white as a Pullets-egg, and of taste so delicious,
that the Bianco Maugiares, which the Portuguez compound of Rice, Brawns of
Capon, Cream, Sugar, and Rose-water, is not more dainty; each fruit hath a Stone as big
and rough as that of the Peach: It will not keep; for when the white begins to turn, it
must be thrown away, and must be eaten as soon as the husk begins to open. Such as are
not used to this fruit will not like it at first, for that it hath the smell of a roasted Onyon;
but the taste is so pleasing, that it may be reckoned amongst the prime and most excellent
fruits of the Indies: One thing it is very remarkable for, that there is so great an antipathy
between it and the Bettele, that the least number of Bettele leaves laid near a Room full
of Duriaons, they corrupt and rot immediately. Accordingly, when a man hath eaten
too much of this fruit, let him but lay two or three Bettele leaves upon his breast, and
he shall be eased; and the eating of but one of these leaves after the Duriaons causes
speedy digestion; so as thus one may eat as much as he will, without the least inconvenience.
               The Lantor-tree,Lantor. which is another sort of Cocoe-tree, as we said before, is frequent in
the Isle of Iava. The leaves are five or six foot long, and so smooth, that the Iavians
write upon it with a Bodkin, and use it instead of Paper.
               
                  
Of all the Indies, no part bears Cubebs but the Isle of Iava: the Iavians call it Cuciombi,
and Cumuc;Cubebs. the other Indians call it Cuba China, because the Chineses first fetch'd it
thence to furnish other parts, before the Portuguez or Hollanders had any Commerce there.
This Fruit grows up another Tree, like Pepper, and in bunches like Grapes. The Iavians
knowing 'tis not any where but with them, esteem it so, as they will not suffer a Plant to
go from amongst them, and sell it not unboyl'd, for fear it should be planted elsewhere,
hough there is such plenty of it, that a Baruth, a weight of fifty six pounds, is worth but
six, or, at the most, seven thousand Caxaes. The use of it is to fortifie the Stomach, and
cleanse the Breast; but the Mahumetans take it with a little Areca, and are of opinion it restores
languishing and spent Nature.
               The Mangosthan is a Fruit growing by the High-wayes in Iava,Mangosthan. upon bushes, like our
Sloes, and much of the same taste.
               The Hearb the Iavians call Talasse,Talasse. and which the Malayans call Lalade, bears neither
Fruit nor Flower; but 'tis used in Sauces, and some eat it green, and assign it the same virtues
as they do the Cubebs.
               In Iava they have another Fruit,Jaca. which grows likewise in other places, call'd Iaca, in
form and bigness like a Citrul, with a thick and rough rind: Within 'tis full of certrin
Nuts, the Kernels whereof, being toasted on coals, are good to eat, and stay the Flux of the
belly. The Tree is very great; but the boughs being not strong enough to bear the Fruit,
it hangs all along the body of it, up from the very ground: Being full ripe, the rind grows
hard and black, and emits a very sweet scent; the Fruit it self often changes taste, yielding
one while that of the Melon, another that of the Peach, sometimes that of Honey, sometimes
that of a sweet Lemmon; but is so hard of digestion, that 'tis never eaten, but vomited
up again: The Nut of it is as big as a Date, and causes windiness in those that eat them
green; but roasted after the manner we told you, they are very pleasant, and good for such
as have a kindness for Women.
               In the same Island,Wild Cinnamon. towards the Streight of Sunda, there grows also abundance of wild
Cinnamon, which the Portuguez call Cantla de Mato, and the Malayans, Cajumanis. It is
not near so good as the fine Cinnamon, whence it comes that there is but little of it bought,
it being hardly worth the transportation.
               The Carcapuli is a Fruit about the bigness of a Cherry,Carcapuli. and much of the same taste,
and the Trees which bear it are like our Cherry-trees. Of these there are several
kinds, whereof some are white, some of a dark red, and some of a lively carnation
colour.
               The Costus Indicus,Costus Indicus. by the Malayans called Pucho; by the Arabians, Cost or Cast, is the
wood and root of a Tree that resembles the Elder-tree, as well in height as in flower and
scent: The Turks, Persians, and Arabians, make an extraordinary Traffick of it, as they
likewise do of Calamus Aromaticus, which also grows on the Coast of the Streight of Sunda.
That yellow and spungy matter, which Women use against pains in the Matrix, is properly
in the Stalk of it. The Iavians give it to their Horses, compounding it with Garlick,
Cummin-seed, Salt, Sugar, and Butter; making it into a Paste, which they call Arata;
and they hold it very soveraign for these beasts, to whom notwithstanding they never give
it, till the extremity of the heats be over.
               The Zerumbet,Zerumbet??? which the Iavians and Malayans call Canior, likewise grows in
these parts, and is like to Ginger, only the Leaves something more long and broad.
They use to dry it, or preserve in Sugar, as they do Ginger, but esteem it above
Ginger.
               There are two kinds of Galanga,Galanga??? by the Arabians called Caluegian. The lesser comes
from China, and is much better then that which is brought out of the Isle of Iava, where
they call it Lanquus. This Herb is neither sowed nor set, but grows naturally, and is
about two foot high above the ground, the flower is white, and the leaves pointed, and as
hard as the point of a Knife. The Iavians use it for a Sallad, as also in Physick; as they
do the root, which is thick and long, and full of knots like a Cane, as biting in taste as Ginger,
and of a very sweet scent.
               Benjamin is a Gum distilling from Trees not unlike Lemmon-trees.Benjamin??? While they are young
the Benjamin is black, which is the best; but as they grow old the Benjamin grows white,
and loses strength, so as to put it off, they mingle it with black: The Moors call it Lovan
Iavy, that is, Incense of Iava.
               In the Forrest of Iava there grow Trees of red Sandale???Sandale??? but the white and yellow
Sandale, which is without comparison the better, comes from the Isles of Timor and Solor.
This Tree is of the bigness of a Walnut-tree, and bears a fruit not unlike our
Cherries, but is black and insipid. The Indians beat white and yellow Sandale, and

make a Concoction wherewith they rub their Bodies, not only for the scent, but for that
they believe 'tis restroative. They value not red Sandale, but sell it at cheap rates to other
parts.
               They have likewise abundance of Ginger,Ginger. by the Malayans called Aliaa, and by the
Iavians, Gati; but they either eat it green in Sauces, or preserve it, for they never
dry it.
               Anacardium,Anacardium. by the Portuguez called Fava de Malacca, by reason of its likeness to 
Bean, is very common here, and the Iavians take it in Milk against the Asthma, and against
the Worms: some pickle them as they do Olives, and they are altogether as pleasant as
the Olives.
               That Wood,Palo de cuebro. the Portuguez call Pala de cuebra, grows there in great abundance. It is
white, inclining to yellow, hard and bitter. The Indians bruise it, and take it in Wine or
Water against burning Feavers, and the stinging of Serpents. 'Tis said, that for this cure
they are beholding to a Creature in size and shape like our Ferrets, by them called Quil
or Quirpela, which they breed for recreation, and to catch Rats and Mice: this little Beast
being a mortal enemy to Serpents, never meets with any of them, but it sets upon them,
and being bitten runs immediately to this root, which is his present cure.
               Palo d' Aguila,Calamba. by Druggists called Lignum Aloes; by the Portuguez, Palo d' Aguila;
and by the Indians, Calamba, grows in Iava, but not in such quantity as in Malacca, Sumatra,
Cambaya, and other places. The Tree is like the Olive-tree, only a little bigger.
The Wood, while green, hath no scent, but as it dries its odour increases. The weightiest
and brownest is the best; the perfection is known by the Oyl that issues out of it when
'tis held to the fire. They make Beads of it, and the Indians use it to imbellish their Cabinets,
but the chiefest use of it is for Physick. For this Wood beaten to powder, and taken
in broath or wine, fortifies the Stomack, stayes vomiting, and cures the Pleurisie and bloudy
Flux. That the Portuguez call Aguila brava, or wild Calamba, is not so good as the other,
and the Indians chiefly use it at the Funerals of their Bramans, making the fire of it that
burns the Corps.
               At Bantam likewise they sell store of Lacque,Lacque. whereof they make Spanish wax,
and the Varnish they lay over so many excellent works in China, Iapan, and other places.
Iava produces of it; but the best comes from Pegu, where 'tis called Tieck, and where
great and winged Ants get up the trees and suck the Gum, which afterwards they lay upon
the boughs as Bees do Honey and Wax: when the boughs are full, the owners cut
them, setting them to dry in the Sun, till the Lacque falls from the boughs, then they beat
it to powder, and give it what colour and form they please.
               The other Drugs gotten in Iava,Other Drugs in Java. are, Pody, a mealy kind of substance, which they use
against Rhume and Wind; Carumba or Flors, a Root whereof they make Sauces, and
wherewith they dye their Cotton-clothes. Conjuapi is a Wood wherewith they rub their
bodies. Samparentam is a Root found near Sunda, stronger then Ginger, and very bitter.
Pontiou they hold good against Feavers, but 'tis exceeding dear. Gatogamber is a Fruit like
an Olive, good against the tooth-ach. Ganti a Root so like Ginger, that the Iavians have
given it the same name; but 'tis dearer; and with it they rub their bodies. Sasam is Mustard-seed.
Doringi is a Drug they give Children as soon as they come into the world.
Galam, a Root growing in the water, and is very refreshing. Tianco, a Fruit they beat
and take in water as soon as they find themselves ill. Maidian, Maya and Corossani, are
intoxicating Drugs they mix in their drinks. Spodium is the ashes of a Tree growing
near Sunda, wherewith they rub their bodies, as they do with Sary, which is a Flower.
The Targary, Surahan and Sedowaya, are Roots for the same use. Sambaya is the Fruit the
Chineses call Geiduar, as big as an Acorn; of high price, by reason 'tis not ordinary, and
is a sovereign Remedy against Poyson, and the biting of Venomous beasts. Ialave is like
Sambaya, and of the same use in Medicine. Paravas is a very cooling Hearb, but very
scarce, and very dear. Tomonpute is a Root like Galigan, used against Inflammations of the
Spleen. The Conduri, which the Iavans call Saga, are red Berries, spotted with black,
wherewith they weigh Gold and Silver, but are not to be eaten, they are so bitter, and, as
some say, poysonous. There is likewise Azebar, the Sycomore, the Nux Indica, and divers
other Trees, Plants and Drugs, to Europeans some known, some unknown, but 'twould require
a peculiar Treatise to name them all, and would fill a large Volumn to describe their
good and bad qualities.
               The Iavians making their benefit of the Portuguez ingratitude to the Indian Princes,
who entertain'd them, do constantly oppose the establishment of any Strangers in the Isle:
But the profit he Kings of Bantam and Iacatra received, by venting their Spices to the
English and Duch was so considerable, that at last they consented, that the people of those

two Nations should build a House for such Factors as they should have occasion to leave
there, and for stowing up the Commodities they traffick'd in. The Dutch, by treaty with
those Kings, regulated the Customs of Importation and Exportation; but those Articles
were so ill kept by the Indian Kings, who raised their rates according as they discovered
the Strangers necessity of Commerce, that the Dutch, to avoid this injustice, and secure
themselves from the violences of the Barbarians,The Dutch fortifie in Jacatra. by degrees secretly fortified their Quarters
at Iacatra, and in a short time made it defensible. The Indians perceiv'd it not, till
'twas past their hopes of forcing it; so as in this despair of driving out the Dutch, they
made use of the bad correspondence betwixt the English and them, which chiefly appear'd
in a Sea-fight they had near Bantam and Iacatra, Ianuary 2. 1619. The Holland Fleet,
which consisted but of seven Vessels, had the worst of the English, that were eleven. The
Dutch being forced to retreat, the King of Iacatra, with the English Forces, besieg'd the
Dutch Fort, now called Batavia; which Siege lasted six moneths, till the Holland General,
having reinforced his Fleet with the Ships that lay in the Molcques, constrain'd the English
to raise the Siege, to embark their Guns, and quit the Streight of Sunda, to get into the
main Sea. The King of Iacatra would have cast the blame of all these disturbances upon
the English; but the Dutch General would not be satisfied with such excuses, but
landing his Forces, to the number of eleven hundren men, he assaulted the Town of Iacatra,
which he took by force, and, having put all to the sword, fir'd it. That done, the
Dutch compleated the fortification of their Quarters, and brought it to a regular form,
with four Bastions of Free-stone, well trench'd and pallisado'd, with Half-moons, Redoubts,
and other necessary Works. The King of Matram, who is as 'twere Emperour
of Iava, in the year 1628. besieg'd this Fort, and, lying under the Cannon, storm'd it
several times; but in the end was forc'd to raise the Siege, as hein like manner was the
year following; and since that time the Dutch have established their Commerce joyntly
with the Chineses, the Iaponeses, Siameses, Succadans, and other Neighbours, taking
ten in the hundred Custom upon all Commodities, whether brought thither, or carried
thence.
               The City of Batavia is twelve Leagues from Bantam Eastward,Batavia. in a Bay, which being
sheltred with some small Islands on the Sea side, is one of the best Roads in all the Indies.
Strangers that inhabit there pay a certain tax by the moneth, according to the profit they
make, which is great: for a Porter, who will with ease get two Ryals a day, payes but one
and a half in a moneth; a Fruiterer four Ryals; a Fisherman three Ryals; Distillers of
Arack eight Ryals; Mechanicks, as Shoomakers, Taylors, &c. two Ryals so as at present
the most important place and firm est establishment the Dutch have throughout the
Indies.
               Between the Isles of Iava and Borneo,Madura??? place of no trading. North-east from the former, lies the Isle of Madura,
governed by a particular Prince, that resides in the City of Arossabaya. In this Isle
there is no Commerce at all, as well because the soil is barren of all Spices, as for that 'tis
inaccessible, by reason of the Shelves of Sand that on all sides environ it. The Islanders,
for the most part, live by Pyracy, and run up to the very Coasts of Pegu, which their
Neighbours are forced to connive at, least they should hinder the exportation of Rice,
which is there in great abundance. The Hollanders, who had been hardly used by the
Iavians, near Tubam and Cidayo, Towns three Leagues from Ioartam in the Isle of Iava,
coming in sight of the Isle of Madura, in the beginning of December, 1596. and apprehending
some danger to be taken by certain Praus, or Ships equipped for War, where the
Prince and Cherif, or High Priest of the Island, were in person; to prevent the Iavians,
whose intent was to surprise them, fir'd some Guns at the great Pran, where the King, and
Cherif, with divers others, lost their lives; for that Ship being three Tires high, and filled
with Souldiers, there was not a Gun fired which destroyed not a great number; so as the
Hollanders, who in the mean time got into their Shallops, with little difficulty became Masters
of them. This done, they made no stay there, but fail'd from thence to the Isle of
Baly, where they arrived Ianuary 30. 1597.
               The Isle of Baly lyes towards the Oriental part of the Isle of Iava,Baly. being in circuit
about twelve Leagues, towards the South, putting out a Cape or Promonory a long
way into the Sea.Its situation. The North point of it is eight degrees and a half beyond the Line,
and the chief City, where the King hath a magnificent Palace, derives its name to the
Island.
               The Islanders are Pagans,
                     . and adore the first thing they meet with at their going out in
the morning; they are black, and their Hair curling: In habit they differ nothing from
their neighbour-Islanders, with whom they likewise correspond, in wearing no Beards;
for when the Hair first begins to come, they pluck it up by the roots. Their Women,

who have an aversion to Beards, oblige them to do so, as also to squat down when they
make water, because Dogs, held with them unclean beasts, piss standing. There is not a
Man but hath several Wives, whence the Island grows so populous, that they reckon upon
six hundred thousand Souls there, though they give way for abundance of Slaves to be
bought from them. The greatest part are Husbandmen or Weavers; by reason the
Land produces great store of Cotton,Abounds in Rice. and is very proper for Rice; but they permit not
any to be transported, lest some hard year should bring them to a necessity of being beholding
to their Neighbours. They have store of Oxen, Buffles, Goats and Swine;
likewise Horses, but they are so small, that none but the Country people use them; Persons
of Quality being carried in Sedans or Coaches. Their Forrests of Oranges, Lemmons
and Pomecitrons,Fowl. are stored with Feasants, Partridges, Peacocks and Turtles;
thei back-Yards swarm with Poultry, and their Fens and Rivers with Ducks and other
wild Fowl.
               In the whole Island there is no other Spice then Ginger,Drugs. which generally grows in all
parts of the Indies, but here are found several other Drugs, as Galigan, Doringui, Canior,
Bangue, &c. as likewise a certain Fruit, inclosed in a Shell, like a Chesnut, white within, of
excellent taste, and sovereign against the Scurvy; also another Fruit as big as a Walnut,
that grows in the ground, like the Saligots.
               The Coasts of the Island,Fish. and the Rivers, so abound in Fish, that, next to Rice, 'tis the
subsistence of the Inhabitants. They entertain in a manner no Commerce, only they set
forth some small Barks to the Isle of Iava, for vending their Cotton-clothes. The Chineses
sometimes come hither to fetch it, and in exchange bring them Sword-blades and
Purcelane. This is a common Road for all Ships bound from the Continent to the Molucques,
which here take in water and refreshments, provisions being at exceeding cheap
rates.Gold Mines. Iron and Brass Mines there are, as likewise Gold, but the King will not suffer them
to be wrought, for fear of attempting his Neighbours to an Invasion; he is well furnished
with store of Gold-plate for his own service. Subjects render him the same respect,
and speak to him with the same Ceremony, as the other Indians do to their King. He seldom
appears in publick, but all Addresses are made to a Noble man, in whom the direction
of Affairs lies. He is intitled Quillor, which is the same as Constable, or Grand-Minister,
in other places. He governs by divers other Persons of Quality, who have their Divisions
and Provinces to regulate, according to Orders from him. The Kings name is in such veneration
amongst them, that all the Subjects unanimously joyn in a moment to oppose any
disturbance to the peace of the State.
               As appear'd in the end of the last preceding Age,Pulo raza. in the person, a Prince of the bloud,
who rising against the King, and having some design upon the life of his Prince, was immediately
taken and condemn'd to death: but the King in compassion chang'd his Sentence,
to perpetual exile in Pulo raza, that is, the desert Island, where he stood confined
with all his Complices, who so well did cultivate it, that divers other families have
been since transplanted thither. They retain the Pagan Religion they profess in the Isle
of Baly, and quit not that accursed custom, for Women to burn themselves after the death
of their Husbands.
               The Isle of Borneo lyes more North then Iava,The Isle of Borneo. and is one of the greatest in those parts:
'tis scituate under the Equinoctial Line, but so, as the greater part is on this side of it, extending
to six degrees towards the North. Some do assign it four hundred Leagues in
circumference, as Bartholomew Leonardo de Argensola, who wrote the History of the Conquest
of the Molucques, and others; but the Hollanders allow it but two hundred and fifty
Leagues. The principal Towns are Borneo, Sccidava, Landa, Sambas, and Benghemassin.
               The City of Borneo,Borneo the Town. from which the Island derives its name, stands in a Marsh, as Venice
doth; so as there is no passing from Street to Street but by boat. The same Argensola
sayes, it contains 23000. Houses, but the Dutch allow it but two thousand. The best
Camphire in the Indies is gotten in the Isle of Borneo:Bazar. Here is also Gold and Bezoar.
This Stone breeds in the Maw of a Sheep or Goat, about a knot of Grass that stayes in
the Maw, and is often found within the Stone. The Persians call these Beasts Bazans, and
the Stone Bazar, which is, a Market, as by excellence proper for a Market or Fair: and
from the same word comes the Bazarucques, the least Money that is sent to the Market.
The Stone is smooth and greenish, and the more substantial and weighty it is, the better it
is, and of the greater vertue. In the Country of Pan, near Malacca, they find a Stone in
the Gall of a certain Swine, more highly esteem'd then the Bazar. It is of a reddish colour,
as smooth and slippery in the feeling as Soap, and exceeding bitter; so that when it
is to be used, they only steep it in cold water, and the water is a most soveraign Antidote

against all poyson, and an effectual cordial against all infectious Diseases. Here they have
likewise Diamonds, Sapan-wood for dying, as also Brasile, Wax, and good store of Pepper,
Frankincense, Mastick, and all other sorts of Gums.
               The Island hath divers Havens and Roads,The Haven but its Cities are not very populous. Borneo
is better then the rest, and the Haven upon the mouth of a fair River, is large and very
commodious. The Spaniards were once Masters of the Haven, but they quitted it, because
the Air was so unhealthful they could not subsist. Their Houses are of Timber,
but so sleightly built, that they ordinarily pull them down to change their habitations, or
pass over to the other side of the River. They are an ingenious and dexterous people, but
addicted to theft, and great affecters of Pyracy, so as sometimes they will cruze up and
down the Sea as far as the Coasts of Pegu, which is four hundred Leagues from that Island.
They use all sorts of Arms, as Swords, and Gosos, which are Bucklers made of boyled
Leather, Lances, Darts, and a sort of Pikes they call Selihes, the wood whereof is extreamly
hard, but withall so small and brittle, that if it break in a Wound, it leaves Splinters, that
render the part incurable. The King is a Mahumetan, as also the greatest part of the
Islanders on the Sea coast; but they that live in the heart of the Island are Pagans. Their
hue is rather black then tawny; they are of compact well proportioned bodies, and go
habited near like the rest of the Indians, with a Linnen about their loins, and on their heads
a little Turbant.
               On the first of October,The Hollanders treat with the King of Sambas. in the year 1609. the Hollanders treated with the King of Sambas,
for establishing a Commerce of Diamonds, which are to be found in the Mountains
far within the Country; and since have made one for Pepper, with the King of Borneo,
with exclusion of all other Forreigners; but the Borneans are no more faithful in the observance
thereof then the other Indians.
               Betwixt the Isle of Borneo and Molocques,Celebes Isl. under the Equinoctial Line, lies the Isle of
Celebes; and if credit may be given to Mercator, this is one of the three Islands Ptolomy
calls Sindas. The chief City here is called Macassar, and lies in the most Southerly part
of the Island, five degrees, seventeen minutes, beyond the Line. It abounds in all sorts of
Provisions, particularly Rice, wherewith in the moneths of March, April and May, the
Territory is so entirely covered, that 'tis not to be imagined there is an inch untill'd: and
in effect, besides what they convert to pasture for their Cattle, and what they assign for
their Cocoes, there is not the least parcel lyes unsowed. In the face they are like the people
of Pegu and Siam, and 'twas but in the beginning of the present Age they deserted Paganisme,
and imbraced the Mahumetan Religion. 'Tis said, that in the time of Paganisme
they were Anthropophagi, and that the Kings of the Molucques sent their Malefactors to
them to be devoured. But it may be averr'd for truth, that at this day the Indies have
not a people so tractable as they: yet they are couragious and irreconcileable where they
once declare enmity. Their chief Armes is Bow and Arrow, whereof they impoyson the
head to render the Wound mortal. The Men are of a comely make, carrying in their
Prepuce a Ball or two of Ivory, or a Fish-bone, massie, and not hollow, like the Siameses and
Peguans: but this custom by degrees wears out, as that amongst the Women, to cut their
Hair off; for at present they let it grow, and coif themselves as the Malayans do. Women,
when they walk the Streets, and Slaves, have their Breasts open, and wear Breeches
that reach from the Navil to the Knee; but when they bathe in their Cisterns or Wells in
the Street, they are stark naked. The Houses of Macassar are built upon Piles, and rais'd
nine or ten foot above the ground, by reason of the Rains which fall with the West and
North-west Winds from November till March, during which season the Road is exceeding
dangerous, and almost useless, because 'tis impossible Vessels should get near the Shore, to
lade their Rice.
               Upon the same Island there is a King of Tello, and another of Battergoa, who are the
most powerful next to that of Macasser. The Dutch Relations tell wonders of the prudence
of the former, and attest they met there with Barks and Frigots so artificially built,
their most experienced Carpenters acknowledged, that they could not possibly have improv'd
their Art to that perfection. He had settled Granaries throughout his Dominions,
to store up Rice, which was not to be stirred till a new recruit had furnisht him with sufficient
to replenish it; and did all he could to engross the Commerce to himself; for which
purpose he had his Factors at Banda, to vend his Cotton-clothes, and lade, in exchange,
Mace and other Spices.
               The Isle of Gilolo, called by the Portuguez, Bato China de Mro; by the Molucquez, Alemaera,
is much larger then Celebes: it yields good store of Rice, of Sagu, whereof we shall
have occasion to speak presently, in the description of the Molucques, wild Hens, and Tortoises
of extraordinary size. The Natives are well proportioned, but savage, and not long
since Anthropophagi, as the Celebans were.
               
                  
Amboyna is an Island o near adjoyning to the Molucques, that some have reckon'd it in
the number of them,Amboyna. as well for the scituation, as for the production of Cloves, which are
said to be kindly no where but in the Molucques. 'Tis scituate four degrees beyond the
Line, two Leagues from the Isle of Ceiram, and is in circuit about twenty four. On the
West-side of the Capital Town there is a Bay of six Leagues, composing a good Road,
where Ships are well sheltered from all Winds. By reason of this Bay the Sea wants not
much of cutting thorow the Island; for on the other side the Sea advances so far within
the Land, that it leaves but a small Isthmus of about sixscore fathom over. The Island
being thus, as 'twere, divided into two parts, the lesser, wherein is the Castle of Amboyna,
contains twenty small Towns, or rather so many Villages, which can send forth about two
thousand men, able to bear Arms. The greater part hath four Towns, which have each
seven Villages substitute,The inhabitants. and can arm about fifteen hundred men. The Natives were heretofore
brutish, and, like their Neighbours, Anthropophagi, or Canibals, in so much that they
would devour their Parents, when age made them decrepit, or when they were visited with
any desperate Disease. The Land it self lay wild, and overgrown with Forrests; but at
present 'tis exceeding fertile, and, besides Cloves, bears all other sorts of Fruits, as Lemmons,
Oranges, Cocoes, Bonanas, Sugar-canes, &c. Oranges particularly are so plentiful, that
one may buy fourscore for a Button. The Inhabitants are a sort of simple people, habited
like the Bandayans, living meanly enough on what they get by the Clove-husbandry. They
use no other Arms then the Dart, (which they cast so dexterously, that they will not
miss the breadth of a Crown piece threescore paces distant) the Cimeter, and Buckler.
They make a sort of Cakes of Rice, Almonds and Sugar, which they sell to their Neighbours
of the adjacent Islands, where they take them against Fluxes. They make likewise
Rice-bread, in the form of Sugar-loaves. Their Galleys, which they call Caracoras, are
well built; and they know how to manage them with such address, that ours come not
near them for swiftness.
               The Island was first discovered by the Portuguez,The discovery. in the year 1515. under the conduct
of Antonio Abreo, who there erected a Column, as well to record the possession he took of
it for the King of Portugal, as to serve for a Trophy of his Adventures, in advancing farther
into the Indies then any of his Predecessors had done. These Portuguez, observing
the Hollanders obstructed the advantageous Commerce they carried on here, in the year
1601. set forth a Fleet of thirty Ships, with a resolution not only to destroy the Hollanders
Trafick, but withall, so to chastize the Inhabitants of Amboyna, who bore more affection to
the Hollanders then to them, that they should change their opinion. D. Andres Furtado de
Mendoza, Admiral of this Fleet, having intelligence of five Holland Vessels that were in the
Port of Banda, resolv'd to fight them, but was worsted, and forced to retreat into the Port
of Isou, the chief City of Amboyna.
               The Hollanders, though victorious, were not in condition to pursue their good fortune,
and much less to hinder the Portuguez from discharging their revenge upon the Inhabitants,
who were most rigorously used by these enraged people; nay, such was their spight,
that they pull'd up their Clove-trees,The Hollanders take Amboyna Castle. meerly that the Hollanders might not make their profit
of them. Hereupon Stephen Verhagen, the Holland Admiral, arriving February 21.
1603. in the Road of Amboyna, landed a party of Souldiers; with design to storm the
Castle. The Portuguez Governour, perceiving his intention, sent forth two of the Garrison
Officers, to demand of him, how he durst approach a place committed to his charge
by the High and mighty King of Spain; to whom the Holland Admiral made answer,
He was come in the Name of the States of the United Provinces, and the Prince of
Orange, with Order to take in the Castle, and expell the Enemy; so as he was to
come to present Articles, or sustain the Assault he should make as soon as his Artillery
came on shore. This Bravado so daunted the Portuguez, that he rendred the
place without so much as a Cannon shot. There march'd out six hundred Portuguez
with their Arms. Such as were married, taking the Oath of Fidelity, were permitted
to stay in Town.
               The Inhabitants of all those Islands,Religion. Iav, Amboyna, and the Molcquez, were all Pagans,
till their Commerce with the Persians and Arabians brought in Mahumetism, which,
notwithstanding, hath not so extirpated their former Religion, but such as embrace Circumcision
continue their Pagan Superstitious: Some make open profession therof, and
adore the Devil, there being neither Town nor Village that hath not one peculiar thereto.
Not that they understand in any sort what the Devil is, or that they have any knowledge
of what the Scripture sayes of him; but they affirm, That what they adore comes out of
the Air, whence some of them call one of their principal Demons Lanithe, that is, Air,
who notwithstanding depends on another greater then he, called Lanthila, nay, is not so

considerable as their Taulay, who in power is next to Lanthila. The general name
for them is Nito, which signifies evil Spirits, or Tuan, that is, Lord or Master.
               They say their Nito appears often to them in the shape of an ordinary person,Consult with the Devil. which the
Spirit takes on him for this purpose, and by which he pronounces his Oracles, that his intentions
may be known. To have conference with him, they assemble, to the number of
twenty or thirty, and call upon him with the beat of a little Drum, consecrated expresly
to this use, called by them a Tyfa, lighting mean while divers Wax-candles, and pronouncing
certain words of conjuration, which they think very effectual. Before they propound
their Affairs, either private, or publick, to him, they present him both meat and drink, and
after he that personates the Daemon hath done eating, the Congregation make an end of the
remainder.
               They take in hand no business,Superstitios. be it never so mean, nay, not so much as piercing of a
Tree to draw Terry, till they have done their devotions to the Devil, and engravd certain
characters upon it, which in their opinion will preserve the Tree, and bless their labour. In
their houses they have one place where they light a wax Candle, and where they wait on
the Devil with meat and drink, who not coming, as it often happens, they eat that themselves
which they had consecrated to him; but leaving some part of it, that, if he should
come, he might find something to stay his stomack. There is not a Master of a Family that
is not provided of a Vesture extraordinary, and a Ring, which he carefully preservs, and
which is constantly kept in the house, for a prpetual testimony of his alliance made with
the Devil. They are prepossessed with this opinion, that there comes no ill but from the
Devil, for which reason they adore him, to avert mischiefs, or appease him, when they fall
upon them.
               They have their Circumcision,Circumcision. but much different from that of the Iews and Mahumetans;
for they circumcise not Children till twelve or thirteen years of age, and in stead of
cutting off the Prepuce, as the Iews do, they only slit it with a little Cane made expresly
for this purpose.
               At their Marriages they use no Ceremonies;Marriage. for the parties being agreed, the Bridegrooms
Father carries a present of some toyes to the Bride, and the Brides Father makes a
Feast, at which they have their  of Tabours and Logologo, or Dances in the honour
of Nito, and so consummate the Marriage, which they break with the same facility they
contracted it. For the Wives leave their Husbands upon the least discontent happens between
them, and provided they are able to restore the Present given them by their Father
in Law, pouring water on their Husbands feet, to shew that they cleanse themselves from all
the impurity they may have contractd together, they take their leave, and the next day
may joyn again in marriage with some other, if they are so agreed.
               Their Oaths for decision of differences,Oaths. or other matters of importance, they make in
the manner following. They put Water into a Dish, into which they cast in Gold, Earth,
and a Bullet of Lead, then dip in it the end of a Musket barrel, the point of a Halert,
Sword, Knife, or some other Weapon; and they give of the Water to him who is to swear;
the design of all these Ceremonies being to raise in him a fear, that all that is cast or dipt
into the Water will conspire his ruine, if he make a false Oath.
               There are amongst them certain people they call zwangi,Sorcerers??? whom they take for Sorcerers;
though for the most part they busie themselves in doing mischief rather by poyson then
enchantments; but if they can prove the least against them, so as there be but grounds for
presumption only, they are undone; and commonly the whole Family suffers with them.
The horrour they have of these people, is one cause they watch dead bodies, with Sword
and Buckler, for fear the Zwangi should come and eat them.
               The Amboynians are naturally timerous,Their qualities. gross and stupid, unfaithful, and so diffident, that
they will not trust a man six pence without a good pawn. They bury their Goods and
Money for fear of Rapine, for being themselves naturally inclined to theft, they think
others would do to them as they would do to others.
               They are not to be taught any thing,Idotible. nor have they any Trades, in so much that the Stuffs
made by them are like Sacks, open at both ends, wherewith the Women cloath themselves.
They can neither write nor read, nor have Characters amongst them, so as they have no intelligence
of former Ages, nor any light of Religion. Their business is fishing, or their
Gardens, where they get some Fruits, to live on, but so slenderly, that 'tis a miracle they can
subsist with so little; nevertheless, for the greatest part, they are of good proportion, and
comely personage.
               From the account we have given you of their Marriages, the small affection betwixt
Man and Wife may easily be guessed at; as indeed there is little or none at all, yet they
love their Children most excssively, but so imprudently, that there is not a Father takes

care to correct them; and to this reason we may attribute the disorders that often happen,
the Children out-raging Nature in the persons of those that brought them into the
world.
               The little knowledge they have of Religion causes a most remarkable humour of profanation
amongst them,Profaneness and so great a contempt of sacred things, that they would deride
their Nito, were they not restrain'd by a sottish fear of some mischief he would do them.
The Portuguez transported thither heretofore some families of free persons, call'd Maldecas,
whom they had taken near Malacca, and who serving the Portuguez had gotten their language,
and in some measure their Religion; but these Families are lost by degrees, and the
little instruction had been given them wearing out with time by conversing with Pagans;
one may say, that except some Proselytes made by the Hollanders, who for the greatest part
are Chineses, there is not a Christian in the Island.
               The Hollanders have three Forts in the Isle of Amboyna,The Hollanders possess it intirely. the Fort Cambella, otherwise
called Victoria, (the Bastions whereof are built of stone) those of Hiten and Louw. The
first hath in it sixty Pieces of Cannon, and a Garrison of six hundred men; so as that without
question, this, next Battavia, is the best establishment they have in the Indies.
               Banda lies twenty four Leagues from Amboyna,Banda. and is about three Leagues in length, and
one in breadth, reaching from North to South in form of a Horse-shooe. It contains some
small Towns, whereof the chief is Nera, but Orsattan and Labbettacca are inconsiderable.
The Inhabitants are all Mahumetans, and so zealous in their Religion, and so devout, they
will not meddle in any business till they have said their Prayers. They enter not into their
Mesquites till they have wash'd their feet; and being there, they pray with such vehemency,
that they may be heard two hundred paces thence. Those Prayers ended, they rub their
faces with both hands, lay a Matt on the ground and stand upon it, lift their eyes twice or
thrice to Heaven, fall on their knees, and bow their head two or three times to the ground,
pronouncing certain Prayers with a low voyce, only moving the lips. In their Mesquites
they have many meetings, where they eat together of what is brought thither by every
one. They have likewise some such Assemblies upon a Mountain, which is in a Wood in
the middle of the Island, where the Inhabitants of Puldrim, Puloway, and Lantor, their
Allies, meet them to consider of publick matters. After they have treated of publick
Affairs, they sit down on the ground, and they serve to every one upon a Banana leaf, which
serves them instead of a Trencher, a Morsel of Sagu, which is their Bread, and a little Rice
steep'd in broath, which they eat by handfuls. During the Feast, the Gentlemen, to entertain
the Guests, have a kind of Skirmish. They are almost in continual war with their
Neighbours, and keep constant Guards upon the Coast, as well to surprize others, as to
prevent their being surprized themselves. Their Arms are the Cimetar,Arms. with them called
a Phahang, and a Buckler of wood above four foot long. They handle their Weapons with
much address, being train'd to it from their infancy. They have likewise Fire-arms, but in
war they chiefly use a sort of Lance, of eight or ten foot long, made of an exceeding hard
wood, which they cast with such force, that they will run a Man quite through with it.
Having cast their Lances, for commonly they carry two, they fall to their Sword, which
hangs at their left side under their Buckler, or to another sort of Weapon, which they dart
and pull back with a string, whereto they tye a short Truncheon, having at the end a crooked
iron that is exceeding sharp and dangerous. Some use Corslets, but these are Persons of
Quality; others contenting themselves with Casks of Steel, and made like Cocks-combs.
Their Gallies are very light, having on both sides, in a manner even with the water, two
Scaffolds like wings, where the Slaves are set to row. They are three to every seat, and
every one hath an Oar, which is properly but a deep wooden Shovel, which they thrust as
far as they can into the Sea, and when they draw it back, they bring it about their heads to
cast out the water; which they do so fast, and with such sleight, that a Ship must be a good
Sailor, that shall with a good wind take one of these Gallies.
               In the Isle of Banda 'tis no rarity to meet with people of sixscore years of age,They live long. and above.
They believe, that who fails to pray for the dead shall have no resurrection, whereas otherwise,
with the Mahumetans, they believe the resurrection of the dead. Women that are
present at the death of a friend, cry out with all violence, as if by this means they would
fetch the Soul back again, but seeing it comes not, they interr the Corps, which is born by
ten or twelve persons on their Shoulders, in a Biere or Coffin covered with white Linnen,
the Men going before, the Women behind. The Corps being laid in the ground, they return
to the house of the deceased, where they dine together; then they burn Incense over
the Grave for four and twenty hours, and at night set a burning Lamp over it, in a Hut
made for that purpose.
               
                  
The Men mind nothing but their recreation, and walking up and down, and leave all
the work to be done by their Wives, whose chiefest business is to break the Nutmeg shell,
and dry the Nut and Mace, wherein consists their greatest revenue. This excellent fruit,
for ought I could ever learn, grows only in the Isle of Banda, which the Inhabitants call
Bandan, or rather in the six Isles 'tis composed of, that is Gunaxi, Nera, and Lantor, (betwixt
which lies the Road for the Vessels that are bound thither) Puloway, Pulorim, and
Bassingin.
               It is a thing to be admired, that these six little Islands should furnish the whole World
with Nutmegs, if it were not certain, that except a few Duriaons, Nancan, Bananas, Oranges
and Cocoes that grow there, they produce not any thing else; and the Islands are so
covered with Nutmeg-trees, that excluding only the fiery Mountain in the Isle of Gunapi,
there is not a foot of Land but is employed, and the Trees at all times loaden with fruit
and flowers green or ripe. They chiefly gather them thrice a year; that is, in April,
August and December, but that which ripens in April is the best. The Tree is not unlike a
Peach-tree,Nutmegs. only the leaves are more short and round. The Fruit is covered with a husk,
as thick as that of our Wallnuts, which being opened, there appears a very thin leaf upon
a hard shell; yet does it not so cover it, but that the shell is to be seen in several places,
and this is that they call the Nutmeg flower or Mace, and the shell must be broken to
come at the fruit. The flower is of a lively carnation, while the Nut is green; but afterwards
it changes, and draws towards an Orange colour, especially when it parts from the
shell. The Inhabitants preserve it in the shell, with Salt or Sugar, and make a very excellent
Preserve. The Natives call the Nutmeg Palla, and Mace Bunapalla.Maces. This Spice
comforts the Brain, helps the Memory, expels Wind, cleanses the Reins, and stayes Looseness.
Mace hath almost the same vertues, but 'tis much more proper for Sauces. Oyl
of Nutmegs strengthens the Sinews,The Oyl of Nutmeg. procures Sleep, stayes Defluxions, and cures
the pains in the Stomack; and of powder of Nutmeg or Mace mixt with the Oyl
of Roses, they make an Unguent soveraign against such Griefs as proceed from Indigestion.
               The Hollanders have built here two Forts,The Hollanders Forts in Banda. which they call Nassau and Belgica, where
the Road is so good, that Vessels come up within Musket-shot, and ride safely at nine or ten
fathom water. The Island is inhabited with about ten or eleven thousand persons; yet
would it be hard to draw out five hundred Men fit to bear Arms. Here they drive a good
round trade in Garments brought from Coromandel, Rice, Purcelane, Velvet, Damask,
Taffaty, Scarlet, Provisions and Ammunirion for the Forts. The Inhabitants are obstinate
and mutinous, so as the Hollanders cannot assure the possession of this Isle, but by force
alone.
               In their Relations of the Isle of Nera,Prodigio Serpents. they report, there are Serpents so great, that one
day, the Author of the twentieth Relation observing his Poultry dayly to decrease, and being
told by the Natives there were Serpents that devoured them, he had then watch'd so
carefully, that they took one, which about midnight was crept into the Hen-roost, and had
made a strange havock. The Servants who kill'd it, found in the belly five Hens, one
Duck, and a sucking Pig, which they made no difficulty to eat of, no more then they did of
the Serpent it self.
               Though some comprehend in the number of the Molucques,Molucques. many of the Islands that
fill up this Oriental Archipelago, yet properly there are called by the name of the Moluccaes,
but the five following Islands, Ternate, Tidar, Motiel, Machiam and Bachiam, by the
ancient Pagans called Cupe, Douco, Moutil, Mara, and Seque. This last is by several Arms
of the Sea divided into divers Isles, which notwithstanding are not known but by the common
name of Bachaiam, because they are subject to one Prince. They are all scituate under
the same Meridian, as 'twere within view of one another, and take not up above the
space of twenty five Leagues, so as the utmost North hath but one degree of Latitude towards
the North, and the farthest South, but one degree toward the South. The Soyl is so
dry and spungy, that it not only drinks immediately the Water that falls from Heaven, but
dryes up the Torrents at their very rising out of the Mountains, and suffers them not to
pay their tribute to the Ocean; and yet the Sun not being able either to penetrate the Forrests,
or consume the Exhalations arising out of the Earth, there remains sufficient moisture
to furnish both Trees and Herbs with constant verdure.
               These Islands, where no Fruit is wanting, and which yield, in great abundance, Bananas,
Cocoes, Lemons, Oranges, Sandal, and Calam, and all sorts of Spices, produce neither
Corn,Sagu a sort of bread. nor Rice; but Nature makes sufficient recompence for this defect, in a sort of nourishment,
which might be accounted miraculous, were it not common in Amboyna, and
other places. They have it from a Tree the Portuguez call Segueiro, and the Molucquez,

Laudan, which grows to twenty foot high, and hath leaves like Cocoes, only a little less???
The Tree is a mans fathom about, nevertheless with a Knife it may be cut down, because
'tis only Bark and Pith: The Bark is about an inch thick, and the rest all Pith, which
serves for Bread. It is somewhat like worm-eaten wood, save that it is white, and may
be eaten as it comes from the Tree, taking away the strings of the wood which are mixed
with it;How they make bread of it. but to make Bread they order it as follows. Having felled the Tree, they cut
it Cylinder-wise, and beat the Pith to powder, which looks like Meal; then they put it in
a Searce they make of the Bark of the same Tree, over a Tub made of the Leaves, and
according as the Searce fills they pour in Water, which dividing the Meal from the Strings
of wood that are mixt therewith, falls into the Tub, as white and thick as Milk, and leaving
a certain settling or consistency at the bottom, falls out at a little Spout at the top of
the Tub; this settled consistency is that which they call Sagu, and serves them instead of
Meal, and in effect is such, when it is dry. It is baked in certain Moulds of Earth, which
they make red hot in the fire, so as putting in this substance, it becomes Paste, and bakes
in a moment, so speedily, that one Man, in a morning, may bake Bread to suffice a hundred
Men a whole day: From the same Tree they extract Thuack, which they drink, and is
as pleasant as Wine.Wine from the same Tree. While the Leaves are young they are covered with a Cotton, whereof
they make Stuffs; and being at full growth, they cover Houses with them; and the
bigger Veins are strong enough to make Rafters for their Houses; and of the lesser they
make good Cordage.
               They have store of Cattle; but they rather affect Fish, though Linschotten sayes they
have neither. Mines of Silver or Gold they have not, and hitherto there are none
discovered of any other Metals; but the Isle of Lambaco furnishes them with Iron and
Steel, whereof they make their Campilans and their Cris, that is, their Swords and
Daggers.
               Their Men are rather black then tawny,The Inhabitants. but the Women not so much. Their Hair is
black and smooth, either naturally, or for that they continually rub it with sweet Oyls???
their Eyes great, their Eyebrows large, their Bodies strong and robustous, but fitter for war
then work. They are dextrous and active, and live long, though they grow gray betimes.
In conversation with Strangers they are civil and obliging; but a little too familiar and
importunate in their demands, self-ended in Commerce, diffident, deceitful, and lyars,
needy, and by consequence insolent. Men wear Turbants, after the Turkish fashion, of
several colours, deckt with Plumes: The King only wears a Crown like a Miter, but in all
things else is clad like his other Subjects, in a Iupo, and Drawers of China Sattin, blew,
red, crimson, green, and yellow. Some there are wear close Coats, tied on the Shoulders,
and cut below, like the ancient Romans military Coats. Women dress themselves in their
Hair, which they lay smooth over their Heads, and tye it behind, and deck it with Plumes
and Flowers, which well becomes them. They have Bracelets, Rings, Neck-laces of
Pearl, Diamonds, Rubies, and Emralds, &c. apparelling themselves almost all in Silk,
using the Stuffes they have from Persia, China, and the rest of the East, in truck for their
Cloves.
               The Chineses,Partly Mahumetans. by possessing a great part of the East, became likewise Masters of this Isle,
and, after their example, the Persians and Arabians, who brought in the Mahometan superstitions,
admit the adoration of their Gods, from whom divers of their Families pretend
to be descended. They know no written Law, and their Customs are barbarous enough;
Polygamy is allowed amongst them, and Adultery passes unpunished; but Theft is severely
punished, as a mortal and unpardonable Crime among them. They have Officers, who at
break of day go about the Town,A particular policy. and with the beat of a Drum awake the people, and exhort
the Masters of Families to remember their Matrimonial Duties, by reason it concerns
the publick, that the Inhabitants should multiply. Both Men and Women express their
arrogancy in their carriage and gate. Every Island hath a peculiar Language, whence we
may conjecture they are originally derived from several Nations, and that 'tis necessity forces
them to use the Malayan, for general Communication.
               The Iavians were they that first brought Cloes to these places,The Clove ade. whence the Persians
and Arabians might convey them to the Greeks and Roman. The Kings of Egypt settled
this Commerce, together with that of other Spices, in the Ports of the Red Sea; where
the Romans having reduc'd that Kingdom to a Province, continued it till the dissolution
of the Empire. The Genueses were long time Masters of it, by transferring it to Theodosia,
now call'd Caffa, whither at length the Venetians sent their Consuls and Factors, taking
the benefit of the Caspian Sea. The Turks spoil'd this Commerce by means of their Caravans,
that brought Spices to divers places on the Mediterranean Sea, where the Europeans
might fetch them with less charge and danger; but the Soldans of Egypt re-established it

at Alexandria and Cayro, by the way of the Nile, and doubtless had kept it still, had not the
Portuguez found out a way to surround Africa,The Portuguez seize it. and fetch this precious Drug from the utmost
parts of the East. Their Conquests in the Indies, and the Fleet they maintain upon
the Persian and Arabian Coasts, towards Cape Guardafun, intirely bereaved the Soldans of
their Commerce; and the Portuguez continued Masters of it, while they kept that Sea:
but after the Hollanders appeared there,Dispossest by the Hollanders. they were constrained to give place, and to lose an
advantage, which no other durst have disputed with them.
               In the year 1511. the Portuguez discovered the Molucques. Francisco Serano, who first
set foot on shore, found so much simplicity there, that Boleyfe, King of Ternate, and Almansor,
King of Tidor, made it their earnest request to have the advantage of the Fort the
Portuguez were about to build, to secure the possession of these Isles. 'Tis true, these two
Princes were declared enemies, and thought to make use of these Strangers Forces in their
particular quarrels: but 'tis to be believed their jealousie was grounded on other principles;
for that Cachil Laudan, King of Bachiam, made the like request to Tristan de Meneses,
who went to relieve Serrano.
               'Twas now some time since Pope Alexander the sixth had divided the two Indies betwixt
the Kings of Castile and Portugal;A difference between the Castilians and the Portuguez for the Moluccaes. in so much that of the three hundred sixty degrees,
which compose the Globe, the Spaniards were to possess what they conquered within
one hundred and eighty degrees, counting from the thirty sixth degree of Lisbone, Westward,
and the Portuguez the other hundred and eighty degrees Eastward; by vertue of
which division the Emperour, Charles the fifth, pretended the Molucques belonged to the
Crown of Castile, by reason Ferdinand Magellanus, who had done very advantageous Service
in the Indies,Grounded on a false supposition. under Alphonso Albuquerque, and had with little satisfaction deserted
the Portuguez, to serve under Charles, computed by Ptolomies authority (upon a false supposal,
that between Indus and Ganges there were thirty degrees, whereas there are scarce
ten) that the Molucques being distant six hundred Leagues, which make about thirty
six degrees from Malacca Westward, they belonged to the Crown of Castile. He was
commissioned by the Emperour to go take possession of them, and upon this design parted
from Saint Lucars the 21. of September 1519. and having wrought to 53. degrees, and
passed the Streight,Magellan finds a new passage. called to this day by his name, the Streight of Magellan, he came almost
to the height of the Molucques; but by contrary Winds, and the Sea-currents, he was
forc'd down to the Manelles, where he was slain, with thirty five of his company; Gonzalo,
Gomez d' Espinosa, and Sebastian del Cano, made afterwards some establishments for the
Emperour, taking an Oath of Fidelity of Sutrau Carala, King of Ternate, Predecessour of
Sultan Bongue, of Sultan Almanzor, King of Tidor, and Sultan Iusuff, King of Gilolo.
But the possession of these Isles was of such importance to the Portuguez, for continuation
of their Spice trade, that they did what was possible to keep them, wherein they found
the less trouble, because the Emperour had his hands full in Europe, and was but imperfectly
informed of the Affairs in Asia, as well by reason the Portuguez hindred the Castilian
Ships passing by the Cape of good hope, as that the passage by the West was so dangerous,
that hitherto it is not used. Notwithstanding all Acts of Hostility passing between
these two Nations in the Indies, 'twas thought convenient that Commissioners for both
Kings should meet at Segovia, in the year 1525. but not agreeing, the meeting was removed
the year following to Sevil, where likewise they came to no result: so as the business
continued in this state, till the Treaty at Saragossa, in the year 1529. at which the
Emperour engag'd these Islands to the King of Portugal, for three hundred and fifty
thousand Ducates. Ever since the Portuguez have injoyed them, till by the union of the
Kingdom of Castile, and Portugal, they were confounded in Philip the Second. After this
the Hollanders ut in there, and the revolution that happened in Portugal in the year 1640.
hath so changed the face of Affairs, that the Spaniards must first conquer that Kingdom,
before they think of the Appendages belonging thereto.
               Ternate is the first and largest Isle of the Molucques,Ternate. scituate twenty eight Leagues from
the Isle of Banda, and forty degrees on this side the Line. It is about eight Leagues in
compass, and no bad Country, yet yields but little Provisions besides Poultry and Goats. It
produces likewise Almonds, excellent good, and bigger then ordinary, though there be
three or four in every shell, which is so hard, 'tis not easily to be broken with a Hammer,
but they make so strong a fire, that Smiths and Forgemen use it instead of Coal. The Inhabitants
likewise plant Tobacco, but 'tis far short of that comes from the West-Indies.
               The chief Town, called Gamma lamma,Gamma lamma. stands on the Sea-side, and is but one Street,
about 2500. paces long. Their Houses are built of Canes or Timber, as are also the
Masquites and Palace Royal. The Road is of no use, for that the bottom being nothing

but Stone and Rock, an Anchor cannot fix. The Holland Vessels ride before a Village
called Telingamma, between the Islands of Ternate and Tidor, within half a League of
Malay.
               The most precious thing in these Islands is the Clove;Cloves. I know not if it be the same
Pliny calls Garyophylla, though the Persians call it Calafur, and these two words seem to
have the same Etymology. The Spaniards sometimes called it Girofe, but at present they
call it Clavos, by reason of its likeness to an ordinary Nail. The Molucques call the Tree
that bears them Siger, the Leaf Varaqua, and the Fruit Chamque. The Tree is much like
the Laurel, only the Leaves something less and narrower, like the Almond-tree, and shoots
forth its branches at the top as Myrtle doe. When 'tis in flower it persumes the Air round
about it; and the Fruit is at first white, in time grows green, and so brown, but not black
till it be gathered.
               Some beat them down with Poles, but commonly they fasten a Rope to the branch a
little above the boal, and drawing it to them force away the Fruit and leaves with much
violence, and so it is when the Inhabitants sell it, and so the Chineses and Indians transport
it.
               The Trees grow of themselves,The tree grows without planting. as the Chesnut-trees do, without planting, or any cultivation.
In the eighth year they bear, and last a hundred years, bringing forth every two
years: for besides the injury done the branches, in getting off the fruit, as we said before,
the Inhabitants break off the young buds, which shoot forth the first year, that they may
be sure of a better crop the next. It is at its full ripeness from August till Ianuary; and
when it is gathered, it is laid in the Sun, and in two or three dayes it is sufficiently
dried.
               Avicenna affirms,Avicenna's errour. that the Gum of this Tree is like Turpentine; but he is mistaken, it
being certain, that it does not produce any at all. For it is so hot, that it does not only
drink up all the Water Heaven is pleased to send it, but it also attracts all the moisture of
the Earth lying about it; nay, its Fruit is so hot, that if a Pitcher of Water be set in a
Chamber, within ten foot of a bag of Cloves, they will so suck up the Water, that within
two or three dayes there shall not be a drop left: which that they have done shall not be
perceivable any way, but by the weight. The Inhabitants know this well enough, and
make their advantages thereof. The Chineses have the same experiment in their raw Silks,
which do attract moysture in the same manner.
               It is commonly affirmed,What cloves the Moluccaes yields yearly. that the Cloves grow only in the Moluccaes: but this is said,
either in regard some comprehend under that name many other Islands near them, or that
the five we have named yield more then all the rest. It is generally granted, that they
yield every year near six thousand barrels of Cloves, allowing five hundred weight and a
half to every barrel, and it is certain withall, that the Islands of Ires, Meytarana, Cavaly,
Sabugo, Marigoran, Gamoconora, and Amboyna, yield also very considerable quantities,
especially that of Veranula; though they are not so fair as those of the neighbouring
Islands.
               In the middest of the Island of Ternate,The Mountain of Ternate. there is one of the highest Mountains in those
parts, covered all over with Palms and other Trees, having at the top a hole so deep, that
it seems to reach the Center of the Earth. Some have had the curiosity to make trial of
the depth of it, and have found that a Rope of five hundred fathom touched not the bottom,
but reach'd a fair Spring, the water whereof was very clear; yet hath there not yet
been any that durst venture to taste of it. Out of this Mountain there issues a sulphureous
smell, and by certain intervals a thick smoak, and sometimes, especially at the two
Equinoxes, it casts up flames, and red Stones, with such violence, that some are carried not
only as far as the City, but even into the Islands of Meao, and Cafures, twenty Leagues distant
from Ternate. The smoak infects all the circum-ambient Air, and the excrements
which the Mountain casts forth, do so corrupt the Springs and waters of those parts, that
no use can be made thereof. The Mountain is green two third parts of its height, but
from thence upward it is insupportably cold, and there is on the top of it a Spring of fair
water, but so cold, that a man can drink but very little of it without taking breath. From
the top of it may be seen the Sea, and all the Moluccas; upon it, a man hath a clear and
serene Air, which is never troubled with Mists or Clouds; and there is a Lake of sweet
water, set about with Trees, in which there is a great number of blew and yellow Lizards,
bigger then a mans arm, which sink under the water as soon as any body comes near
them.
               There is no difference of Seasons in these Islands,But one season in the Moluccaes. nor any certain time for Rain, though
it rains oftner with the North-west wind, then it does with the South. There are Serpents
there thirty foot long, and of a proportionable bigness; but they are neither dangerous

nor venemous, no more then are those of Banda. Some affirm, that these Creatures,
not finding any thing to feed upon, eat Grass, and going to the Sea-side vomit up what they
had eaten, and by that means draw together a great many Fish, which being intoxicated
with the chew'd Grass, flote upon the Water, and so become the prey and food of these
Serpents.
               There is in this Island a kind of Beasts they call Cusos,Cusos. that keeps constantly in Trees,
living on nothing but Fruit. They resemble our Rabbets, and have a thick, curling, and
smooth hair, between gray and red, eyes round and fiery, little feet, and such strength in the
tail, that they will hang by it, the better to reach the fruits. The Forrests are full of wild
Birds, and, except the Parrot, there are few domestick, at least of those known to us.
There are Crevisses that come ashore, and creep under certain Trees, the very shadow
whereof is so virulent, that no Grass grows near them. I know not whether it be from
that Tree they contract that venomous quality, which lies in one part of them, which is
so dangerous, that it kills in four and twenty hours those that eat it. Others there are
that resemble Grashoppers, and lye in Rocks, where they take them by night with firelight:
near the tail, in a bag, they have a lump that is exceeding delicate, for which they
take them.
               In the Moluccaes there is a certain Wood,A Wood incombustible. which, laid in the fire, burns, sparkles, and
flames, yet consumes not, and yet a man may rub it to powder betwixt his fingers.
               Near the Fort of Ternate grows a Plant,Leaves turn'd to Butterflyes. by the Inhabitants call'd Catopa, from which
there falls a small Leaf, the Stalk whereof turns to the Head of a Worm, or Butterfly, the
Strings to the body and feet, and the wings are made out of the finer part of the Leaf, so
as at last there is a compleat Butterfly.
               Tidor is an Island as fruitful as that of Ternate, but larger. In a Signet of the Kings of
this Island, in Persian or Arabick Characters, it appears, this Island was called Tudura, not
Tidor;Tidor. and they say the word signifies Beauty and Fertility. These people have the industry
to prune and water the Clove-tree, which by this means bears a fruit much fairer
and stronger then that which owes its production only to nature. The white Sandalwood,
that grows here, is doubtless the best of all the Indies. Here they have Birds,Birds of Paradise. by
the Inhabitants called Manu codiatas, by the Spaniards, Paxaros de l' Cielo; those we call
Birds of Paradise. Many take them to have no feet; but they are deceived; for they that
catch them cut off their feet so near the body, that the flesh beginning to dry, the skin and
feathers joyn together, so that there scarce remains any scar.
               The Dutch in Ternate possess the Town of Malaya, regularly fortified, and not far off the
Fort of Taluco. In Tidor they have the Fort Marieco. In Motir again they have a Fort
with Bastions of Stone. In Machiam they have made three Forts. At Taffaso, Tabillola,
and Guoffiquia, and in Bachiam, the Fort Bareveldt.
               The King of Bachiam owns neither the King of Ternate nor Tidor for Superiour;King of Bachiam. but
is himself Soveraign, and independent as to any Forreign Power. His Territory is great,
where there grows great store of Sagou, so as the Inhabitants subsist with little labour,
which makes them so idle and lazy, that the Kingdom, which heretofore was one of the
most considerable of the Molucques, is so sunk from that grandeur, that at present it can
hardly raise five hundred fighting men.
               The Isle of Machiam was brought under the jurisdiction of the Dutch by Admiral
Paul van Carden,Machiam. in the year 1601. The chiefest of the three Forts they are possessed of is
that of Guoffiquia, which is built upon an Eminency, with four Bastions of stone, yet is it
but a small one, and irregular, in regard that, for want of place, they could not make all the
Bastions of the same bigness, nor extend the Curtain as far as it should have been. The
Fort of Taffaso is also upon an ascent, and hath four Bastions; but it is bigger then the
other, and distant from the Sea about a hundred and sixty paces. These two Forts have
neither Wells nor Cisterns, save that near the top of the ascent on which Taffaso stands,
there is a Well within a Half-moon, which serves for a fifth Bastion to the place. Tabillola
hath but two Bastions, so far one from the other, that they cannot command all the Curtain,
so that there is no great account to be made thereof. This Island is about seven
Leagues in compass, and subject to the King of Ternate: It is very populous, able to
raise two thousand and two hundred fighting Men; and it hath Sagu and other provisions
sufficient for the Inhabitants, and yields as much Cloves as any of the other
Islands.
               Besides the five Islands properly called the Molucques, there are others, to the number
of seventy two, subject to the King of Ternate, scituate in the same Archipelago from
Mindanao, on the North-side, and Bina and Corca, which are on the South, and between
the Continent of New Guiny towards the East. The chiefest are Motir; Machiam, Cajoa,

Xula, Burra, Na, Noloa, Meao, Tufure, Doe, Saquite, Totole, Baol, Guadupa, Gorontano, Ilibato,
Tamsne, Manado, Doudo, Labague, Iaqua, Gabe, Tobuquo, Buto, Sanguien, &c.
amongst which some lye seventy Leagues from Ternate. The Kings of all these Islands
are Tributaries to the King of Ternate, and tyed to find him such a number of Souldiers,
which the Author of the History of the Molucquez, whom we mentioned before, raises to
sixscore thousand.
               North of the Molucques lye the Isles now call'd the Philippins,Philippins. discovered by Ferdinand
Magellanus, when he compass'd the World in the year 1520. and had doubtless given
them his own name, had he lived till this new discovery: Sebastian del Cano, his Camerade
in this stupendious Navigation, not daring to hazard an establishment after the death of
Magellanus, who was slain in these Islands, as we said before, return'd for Spain. After this
there was no mention of these Islands, till that in the year 1565. D. Lu de Valasco, Viceroy
of New Spain, sent the Adelantado; Michel de Laguaspe, into this Sea, where he put
into haven in these Islands, which in honour of King Philip the Second, who then
reigned in Spain, he called by the name of Philippines. His first Conquest was the
Isle of Zebue, where he remain'd six years; after that he went to Luson, now called
Manille,Manille. from its chief City, whereof Velasco, after a sleight opposition, became
Master.
               This City lies in a Canton of Land, incompassed all about with the Sea, fourteen Degrees
on this side the Line, in the most Southerly part of the Isle, which is in compass
thee hundred and fifty Leagues. On the North, it hath China, from which it is distant
seventy Leagues; on the North-East, the Isle of Iapan, which is two hundred and seventy
Leagues distant from it; Eastward, the Ocean, and towards the South the great Archipelago,
which is as it were divided into five Seas, filled with so many Islands, Kingdoms
and Provinces, that it may be said, they are in a manner innumerable. The Chineses,
who were heretofore possessed thereof, have now deserted them, but still trade
thither.
               The Inhabitants in their labour answer the fertility of the soyl, which produces Corn,
Rice, all sorts of Fruits, and Drugs; and it breeds Neat, Buffler, Deer, Goats and Swine;
so as they want nothing necessary to livelihood; and the Chineses take care they shall want
nothing that is superfluous, as Silk, Purcelane, and Lacque. They have also Date-wine,
but they make it of a different manner to other places: for they draw it from their Cocoes,
by cutting off one of the boughs, whence there distils a Liquor which they suffer to
work till it grows as strong as Spanish wine. They have the best Lemmons and Oranges
in the World, and the most excellent Figs and Pears, all sorts of Birds of prey, and domestick,
Falcons, Tercels, Parrots, Eagles, &c. but principally such abundance of Crocodiles,
that they are constrain'd to kill them, to extirpate the breed: for you have here Men
of sufficient courage to encounter a Crocodile single, though as big as an Oxe. For the
Combat they Gantlet their left Arm to the Elbow,Hunting of Crocodiles. taking in that hand a Truncheon of a
foot long pik'd at both ends, and a Dagger in the other, and in this posture they go into the
River up to the Waste. The Crocodile no sooner spies his Man, but he comes on with
open mouth to swallow him; the Indian presents him his left hand, and thrusting it down
his throat, hinders his jaws from shutting, and in the mean time gives him so many wounds
in his throat with his Poniard, that he kills him. This Creature is in form like a Lizard, but
covered with Scales, so hard, that he is invulnerable all over but in the throat and belly. It
layes abundance of Eggs, which are so hard, that they will not break with throwing against
a Stone; and to hatch them they thrust them into the Sand, on a River side, that heat
and moisture, the principles of Generation, may hatch them. These Islands breed more
Tigers, Lions, Bears, and other wild Beasts, then Africk does, but especially the
Algalias, which are the Creatures from which they get the Musks, and Civet-Cats.
               All these Islands are very populous, and so rich, that not only the Chineses continue their
trading thither, with great advantage, but also the Spaniards,The Commerce of the Chineses and Spaniards in the Philippins. who heretofore brought thither
money from New Spain, by which they gain'd two Marks of Gold for eight of Silver,
having given over that Trade, in regard they make far greater advantages by their other
Merchandizes, the return whereof many times come to a thousand for a hundred, by the
traffick they have there with the Chineses, who bring all sorts of Cottons and Silk-Stuffes,
Purcelane, Gun-powder, Sulphur, Iron, Steel, Quicksilver, Copper, Meal, Nuts of several
kinds, Bisket, Dates, Linnen-cloath, Cabinets, Ink-horns, and things made of Lacque: which
the Spaniards come and snatch up to be carried into the West-Indies, where they have money
for nothing.
               
                  
The Spaniards have in the City of Manilla an Arch-bishop, who hath spiritual Jurisdiction
over all the Philippine Islands,The Archbishop of Manilla is Viceroy. which he exercises by three Suffragan Bishops, and
some Priests. These are so highly respected by the Inhabitants, who have not shaken off
their Original simplicity, that they govern the Country, and keep it in subjection to the
Spaniards. They are indeed such absolute Masters of these Islands, that though in several
of them there is not so much as one Spaniard, yet is there not one of the Inhabitants
refuses to pay the Tax imposed upon him, which is by the Poll, at ten Ryals a
Head. The same Arch-bishop hath also the Quality of Viceroy, and exercises all the
Functions thereof, joyntly with the Kings Councel, which is established in the same City,
as well for Affairs of general concernment, as for the Appeals of such differences as may
arise in the other Cities.
               The City and Houses of Manilla are of Stone,The City of Manilla. and built after the modern way; and
the City it self is so great, that the Spaniards have been forc'd to divide some part of it
from the rest, to serve them for a Cittadel, in case of necessity; by which means they avoid
the charge of keeping so great a number of Souldiers as might be requisite for the defence
of the place. The Haven, which is called Cavite, lies two leagues from the City, and is defended
by two wooden Forts. There live within the City of Manilla, and about it, above
fifteen thousand Chineses, besides those who come thither every year, from December to
April, and trade with above five hundred Ships. The Iaponeses come thither also, but
not in so great a number, and yet the Spaniards are much more jealous of them, then they
are of the Chineses.
               
                  
                  IAPAN.
                  JAPAN is a collection of several Islands made there by the Sea, from the one and
thirtieth degree of elevation to the thirty ninth, being in some places but ten leagues
in breadth, in others, reaching to thirty. This Country, which was anciently called
Chryses, or, if we may credit Mark Paulo Veneto, Zipangry, hath on the East New Spain,
on the North Tartary, on the West China, and on the South the Sea, and that part of the
World, which is called Terra Australis. It is divided into sixty six little Kingdoms, fifty
three whereof depend on that part of this great Empire, which is properly called
Iapon, or Iapan, and consists of two very powerful Kingdoms, called Meaco, and
Amagunce, under which all the rest are comprehended. The other part is called
Ximo, and comprehends nine Kingdomes or Provinces; the chiefest whereof are
Bungo and Figen; and the third part called Xicoum, comprehends the other four
Kingdoms.
                  The Iaponneses themselves acknowledge,It is doubted whether it be on Island or Continent. that they cannot positively affirm, whether
their Country be an Island, or part of the Continent; inasmuch as from the Province of
Quanto, whereof the City and Castle of Iedo is the Metropolis, as it is also of the whole
Territory, as far as the extremities of the Province of Tzungaa, it is seven and twenty
dayes journey towards East and North-East. Then you cross an Arm of the Sea, about
eleven leagues over, to get into the Province of Iesso, or Sesso, which is so covered with
Woods, and checker'd up and down with Mountains, that the Emperour of Iapan hath
not yet been able to search what may be had out of them. All they could ever learn, is,
that there were seen in those parts a sort of people, who were hairy all over their bodies,
and suffered the hair of their heads and beards to grow, so as that they seem'd rather beasts
then men. Whereto they add, that they make use of that passage by Sea, to go into Sesso,
whence they bring Furs, not out of this respect, that the Sea divides that Province from
Iapan, but that it were a great way about to go over those inaccessible Mountains which
joyn those two Provinces.
                  The Island which we call Iapan, and the Inhabitants name Nippon, is divided into six
great Provinces, which are called Sayecock, Chickock, Iamaysoirt, Ietsengen, Quanto and
Ochio, which are subdivided into several other lesser ones, which are governed and possessed
by Lords and Princes, whose names we shall here give, together with their Revenues,
that the Reader may thereby judge of the greatness of this Empire, whereof
we have hitherto had no great knowledge, setting down the sums according to their
way of accounting, by Cockiens, which are worth about four Crowns French money apiece.

                  Besides all these, there are yet some five or six and twenty, who have each of them ten
thousand Kockiens of yearly Revenue. But we shall forbear the naming of them.
                  It remains then only, that we give an account of the Revenues of those Lords who are
actually attendant on the Court, which are so considerable, that they may well deserve a
place by themselves.

                  Now the Revenues of the Princes and Lords of whom we have given this account,
consists altogether in Lordships and Demesnes: for some are rich in Corn and Cattle, others
in several Mines, as Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Quick-silver, Iron, &c. Others are wealthy
in Woods, Flax, Cotton, or Silk; of all which the Emperour hath a certain knowledge, by
the secret informations sent him by those Secretaries whom he places about them to mannage
their Affairs; for he recommends to every one of them a Secretary, with a Letter to
this effect.The Emperour of Japan's policy. Well-beloved, I know you have many Vassals and Servants, and that the occasions
wherein you are to employ them are very great; therefore I send you a person, whose assistance
may in some measure ease you of the burthen which lies upon you, and of whose fidelity you
may be assur'd, in as much as I commend him to you, as one who hath been brought up at my
own house: Make use of him, and take in good part the care I have of your person and affairs.
These indeed, for the most part, are such as have serv'd the Emperour in their youth, in his
three Chambers, and of whose abilities, prudence, and judgment he is satisfied, assuring
himself of their fidelity, besides the expressions he might find thereof during the time of
their service, by an act signed with their bloud: in so much that there is not ought done
in the Provinces, whereof he hath not, by this means, a perfect account. For these Secretaries
keep an exact Journal of whatever they observe in the life and actions of the Princes
whom they are sent to, who undertake nothing without their advice, nor do any business
wherein they are not consulted, which gives them great authority in the Provinces,
and makes the Princes themselves look on them as such, whose favour they stand in need of
to keep a fair correspondence with the Court. On the other side, these Princes are glad to
have able and understanding persons about them, such as may observe the miscarriages of
their Government, and have the confidence to be their Remembrancers thereof; as chusing
rather that a faithful Servant should acquaint them therewith, that so they may be seasonably
reform'd, then that they should become the discourse of the people, or any should
take occasion thence to do them ill Offices about the Emperour.
                  The great Lords,The Lords have three names. who govern the chiefest Provinces, have three names; to wit, their
own proper Name, that of the Family, and the Sirname, which they take from their Province,
and which they commonly give the Castle where they live; and they are the more
willing to be called by the name of their Family,Slaves dye with their Masters. then their own, upon this account; that,
as they say, the Family was before them. But it is withall to be observed, that there is
not any man but hath his name changed thrice; for the name which had been given him
in his Infancy, being not fit for him when he is become a man, at the age of twenty years
there is another given him; and when he comes to that of fifty five or sixty, he receives a
third name, such as was not fit for youth or a less advanc'd age.
                  The departure of great Lords is commonly attended by the voluntary execution of
twenty or thirty Vassals or Slaves, who rip up their bellies and die with their Masters.
These are oblig'd to this by an Oath, and it is done partly by way of acknowledgment of
the particular kindness which their Lords had for them. Having acquainted their Lord,
that they are willing to be oblig'd to sacrifice themselves in that manner when occasion
shall require, they entertain him with a short discourse to this purpose; Most mighty Sir,
you have many other slaves and servants, of whose affection and fidelity you are assur'd; who
am I, or what have I deserv'd, that you should honour me with your favour above any of the

rest? I resign up this life to you, which is already yours, and promise you, I will keep it no longer
then it shall be serviceable to yours. Then the Lord and the Vassal take off, each of
them, a Bowl of Wine, which is the most Religious Ceremony they have among them, to
confirm their Oaths, which thereby become inviolable.
                  To do this execution upon themselves,Their mannr of ripping their bellies. after the death of their Lord, they get together
all the nearest of their Kindred, who conduct them to the Mesquite or Pagode, where they
sit down upon Mats and Garments, wherewith they cover all the floor, and having spent
some time in making good chear, they rip up their bellies, cutting them cross, so as that all
the guts come out; and if that does not dispatch them, they thrust themselves into the
throat, and so compleat the execution. Nay, there are some, who coming to hear that
their Masters intend to build some Edifice, either for himself or the Emperour, will desire
him to do them the honour, that they may be laid under the Foundations, which
they think are made immoveable by that voluntary Sacrifice; and if their request be
granted, they chearfully lay themselves down at the Foundation, and have great Stones
cast upon them, which soon put them out of all pain. But it is for the most part Despair
which puts them upon this resolution; in as much as these are of that kind of Slaves,
who are so cruelly treated, that death were more supportable to them then the wretched
life they lead.
                  All their Pagodes or Mesquites are of Wood,Their Mesquites. rais'd three or four foot from the ground, and
about seven or eight fathom square; They have on the outside many Turrets, having
lights on all sides, and gilt all over, but very narrow, and set out with certain fantastick Figures,
but wretchedly done, as to proportions. They have also Statues in their Pagodes,
whereto they address their Prayers, and bestow on them, by way of Alms, a certain number
of Caxias, which the Priests make their advantage of.
                  But their Castles are much better built.The Cities of apan are not wall'd??? His Majesty hath belonging to him many
spacious and fair ones, but the most considerable are those of Osacca and Iedo. The
Princes and great Lords have also very handsome Castles, but those which are fortifi'd
are oblig'd to receive a Garrison from the Soveraign. The Cities have not any Fortifications
at all: for, some few only excepted, which lie between Firando and Iedo, and
have only simple walls; the rest have not any at all, but the Streets are streight, and of
the same breadth and length, that is, sixty Iekiens, which make about fourscore and ten fathom.
Every Street hath two Gates, which are shut up in the night, and a Watch kept
at them: as also two Officers, who are accountable for the disorders committed in their
Quarter, and speak to the Judge, about any thing wherein the Inhabitants of the Streets,
whereof they have the oversight, are any way concern'd; there being, it seems, such order
taken, that all persons are not permitted to present themselves indifferently before the Magistrate,
but they would have it done by such as know what respect they owe to their Superiours.
                  The Cities or Towns have no particular Revenue,No Impositions in Japan. nor any sums of Money in bank,
whereof they have the disposal; for all the Demene belongs to the Soveraign, who bestows
the Revenue thereof on the Princes and great Lords before mentioned, and permits
not the raising of any Impositions or Taxes, of any nature whatsoever. Nor is it to be
fear'd that the mildness of the Air of that Countrey should breed any of those Grashoppers,
which consume, where-ever they come, all the Fruit which the Hail hath left on the
Trees, in so much that they leave not any verdure on them. They only pay a small chief
Rent for their Houses, which the great Lords receive yearly, but it amounts not to above
thirty shillings for the greatest, those of the middle sort ten, and the ordinary ones twenty
pence. The Inhabitants are, besides these, oblig'd to certain dayes works, and to find a man
for their Lord, to do what business he hath to put him upon; but this happens not above
twice or thrice a moneth, and is but for an hour or two, or at most but for half a day. By
this means the Lord lives upon his Demese, the Souldier by his Pay, the Merchant by his
Traffick, the Tradesman by his Trade, and the Husbandman by his Labour.
                  One of the most considerable parts of these Lords Revenues consists in Fishing, especially
that of the Whale, which the Emperour gives them. There are taken every year about
two or three hundred upon the Coasts of Iapan, but they are not so big as thoe taken towards
the North, and have, at most, not above seven or eight inches of fat, but much flesh,
or meat, which the Iaponneses feed upon.
                  There is no Lord,The powe of Masters over their Servants. nor indeed any Citizen, or Merchant, but may put his Vassals and Domesticks
to death, and that by way of Justice, he himself being the Judge; but to others
Justice is administred, all over the Country, in the Emperours name. Gentlemen and
Souldiers have the priviledge to be their own Executioners, and to rip up their bellies
themselves: but others are forc'd to receive their death from the hands of the common

Executioner. They alledge, as a reason for this proceeding of theirs, that Merchants are,
in some respect, infamous, in as much as they are, for the most part, Lyars, and deceive those
that trust them. Tradesmen they sleight, as being only but publick servants; and the Peasantry
is contemptible, by reason of the wretched condition they live in, which is little
better then that of Slaves. Only the Gentlemen and Souldiers are best respected, and live
at the charge, and upon the labour of others.
                  No offence,Gaming a Crime. though never so small, but is punish'd with death, but especially Theft, though
it were but for a Penny. Gaming, whether that which depends upon chance, or requires
skill, is capital among them, if it be for money; and he who kills another, though innocently,
and in his own defence, is to die without mercy; with this only difference, that such
as kill in their own defence, as also they who commit such Faults or Offences, as would not
here be punished with death, die only themselves, but other Offenders involve all their
Kindred in their misfortune;All the Relations of Offenders die with them. so that for the Crime of one single person, the Father, Brethren
and Children are put to death, the Wives and Daughters are made Slaves, and the
Estate of the whole Family is confiscated. And this happens so frequently, that there are
Commissioners expresly appointed for the administration of what is so confiscated; yet
does not the money raised thereby go to the King, but is imployed in the building of Pagodes,
and the repairing of High-wayes and Bridges.
                  The torture Thieves are put to,A particular Punishment for Thet. for want of evidence, makes rather the unfortunate then
the guilty to be condemned. They take a piece of Iron, about a finger thick, and a foot
square, and make it red hot, and as soon as the redness is gone, and the Iron return'd to its
own colour, they put it to the hands of the party accused, upon two sheets of Paper,
which immediately flame, and if the accused person can cast the piece of Iron upon a little
Hurdle standing near him, without burning himself, he is dismissed; but if his hands
are ever so little touched by the Fire, he is sentenc'd to die. This Crime is punish'd with
a particular kind of death. The Criminal is tied with a Straw-rope, by the Neck, to a
great Cane, overthwart which they put two other Canes, much after the manner of a Lorrain-Cross,
whereto they fasten the Feet and the Hands, and then the Executioner runs
him through with a Pike, from the right Side up to the left Shoulder, and from the left
Side to the right Shoulder: so that being twice run through the heart, he is soon dispatch'd.
Sometimes they only fasten the Malefactor with his Back to a Post, and they
make him stretch forth his Hands, which are held out by two Men, and then the Executioner,
standing behind him, runs him in at the Neck, and so into the Heart, and dispatches
him in a moment.
                  The Lords have such an absolute power over their menial Servants, that there needs but
a pretence to put them to death. An example of this happened not long since; a Servant
had the insolence to address himself to a Gentleman, to proffer his service to him, but ask'd
greater Wages then he knew the other was able to give, purposely to abuse him. The Gentleman,
perceiving the impudence of the Raskal, was a little troubled at it, but smother'd
his indignation, and only told him, that his demands were very great, but that he had so
good an opinion of him, that he must needs be a good Servant. Accordingly he kept him
a while; but one day charging him with some neglect, and reproaching him, that when he
should have been about his business, he had been idling about the City, he put him to death.
The Gentlemen and Souldirs are for the most part very poor, and live miserably; by being
highly conceited of themselves, most of them keep Servants, though only to carry their
Shoes after them, which are indeed but as it were a pair of Soles, made of Straw or Rushes,
having a hole towards the toe, which keeps them on their feet.
                  The Crimes for which all of the Family or kindred are put to death,The Crimes for which all the Kindred are put to death. are Extortion,
Coyning, setting of Houses on fire, ravithing of Women, premeditated murther, &c. If a
Mans Wife be guilty of any Crime her Husband is convicted of, she dies with him, but if
she be innocent, she is made a Slave. Their punishments bear no proportion to the Crimes
committed, but are so cruel, that it were not easie to express the barbarism thereof. To
consume with a gentle Fire, or only with a Candle, to crucifie with the Head downwards,
to boyl Men in seething Oyl or Water, to quarter and draw with four Horses, are very ordinary
punishments among them.
                  One who had undertaken to find Timber and Stones for the building of a Palace for the
King, and had corrupted the Officers appointed by his Majesty to receive and register what
he should send in, was crucified with his head downwards. The officers were condemn'd
to rip up their bellies; but the Merchant was put to the foresaid death. He had the repute
of an honest man, and was one that had had occasion to obliege several Persons of
Quality; in so much that some resolved to petition the Emperour for his pardon, though
these intercessions for condemn'd persons be in some sort criminal; and indeed the Emperour

took it so ill, that the Lords, who had presented their Petition for him, had no other
answer thereto, but the reproaches he made to them of their imprudence.
                  It happened in the year 1638.A horrid execution. That a Gentleman, on whom the King had bestowed the
Government of a little Province, near Iedo, so oppressed the Country people, that they
were forc'd to make their complaints thereof to the Court, where it was ordered, that the
said Gentleman, and all his Relations, should all have their bellies ripp'd up on the same
day, and as near as might be at the same hour. He had a Brother, who lived two hundred
fourty and seven Leagues from Iedo, in the service of the King of Fingo; an Uncle,
who lived in Satsuma, twenty Leagues further; a Son, who serv'd the King of Kinocuni;
a Grand-son, who serv'd the King of Massamme, a hundred and ten Leagues
from Iedo; and at three hundred and eighty Leagues from Satsuma, another Son, who
serv'd the Governour of the Castle of Quanto; two Brothers, who were of the Regiment
of the Emperours Guard; and another Son, who had married the only Daughter of a rich
Merchant near Iedo; yet were all these persons to be executed precisely at the same hour.
To do that, they cast up what time were requisite to send the Order to the farthest
place, and having appointed the day for the execution there, Orders were sent to the
Princes of all the forementioned places, that they should put to death all those persons
upon the same day, just at noon, which was punctually done. The Merchant, who had
bestowed his Daughter on that Gentlemans Son, died of grief, and the Widow starv'd her
self.
                  Lying is also punished among them with death,Lying punished with death. especially that which is said in the presence
of the Judge.
                  The forementioned punishments are only for Gentlemen, Souldiers, Merchants, and some
other persons of mean quality: but Kings, Princes and great Lords are ordinarily punished
more cruelly then if they were put to death. For they are banished into a little Island
named Faitsensima, which lies fourteen Leagues from the Province of Iedo, and is but a
League about. It hath neither Road nor Haven, and it is so steepy all about, that no
doubt it was with the greatest danger imaginable, that the first who got up to it made a
shift to do it. Those who first attempted to climb it up, found means to fasten great Poles
in certain places, whereto they have tyed ropes, with which they draw up those that are
sent thither, and make fast the boats, which otherwise would split against the Rocks with
the first Wind. There grows nothing in all the Island, but a few Mulberry-trees, so that
they are obliged to send in provisions for the subsistance of the Prisoners. They are relieved
every moneth, as is also the Garrison kept there, but they are dieted very sparingly,
as being allow'd only a little Rice, some roots, and other wretched fare. They hardly afford
them a lodging over their heads, and with all these miseries, they oblige them to keep
a certain number of Silk-worms, and to make a certain quantity of Stuffs every year.
                  The expence which the Emperour of Iapan is at every year in his Court,The Emperours expence. and what relates
thereto, to wit, the sallaries and allowances of the Officers and Counsellours, amounts
yearly to four millions of Kockiens, and the sallaries of Governours of places and
Military persons, together with the Pensions he gives, amount to five millions of
Kockiens.
                  They who speak of the Soveraign Prince of all Iapan, give him the quality of Emperour,
in as much as all the other Lords of the Country, on whom they bestow that of
King, depend on him and obey him, not only as Vassals, but as Subjects, since it is
in his power to condemn them to death, to deprive them of their Dignities, to dispossess
them of their Territories, to banish or send them to some Island, for very petty
Offences.
                  The Castle of Iedo,Jedo Castle. which is the place of his ordinary residence, is near two Leagues in
compass, and is fortified with three Walls, and as many Moats, very deep, and built of
Free-stone, but so irregular, that it is impossible to assign it any certain Figure. Within
less then three hundred paces, a Man must pass through eight or nine Gates, not one of
them standing opposite to another; for being come within the first, he must turn on the
right hand to go to the second, and being come within that on the left hand to go to the
third, and so alternately till he comes to the last. Just within the last Gate there is a
Magazine of Arms, for three or four thousand men, on which about all the Streets, which
are fair and broad, having on both sides many magnificent Palaces. The Gates are done
over with great Iron bars, and over every Gate there is a House, wherein two or three
hundred Souldiers may be lodg'd. The Emperours Palace stands in the midst of the Castle,
and hath belonging to it many Appartments, Halls, Chambers, Closets, Galleries, Gardens,
Orchards, Groves, Ponds, Rivers, Fountains, Courts, &c. and several particular Houses,
for his Wives and Concubines.
                  
                     
At your coming out of the Palace, you go into that quarter, where the Princes of the
Bloud,The Palaces of the Kings. and Counsellers of State live, and thence into another quarter, where are the Palaces
of the Kings and great Lords of Iapan, which are all gilt both within and without;
and the more sumptuously built out of this respect; that there is a certain emulation amongst
them, who shall be at greatest expence to please the Emperour. In the next quarter
to this, there live other Princes and Lords, who are not so powerful as the former, yet
have their Palaces gilt, and so richly furnish'd, that a Man would think, at his first coming
in, he met with Mountains of Gold. In this quarter there live some of the Wives
and eldest Sons of those Princes, whom the Emperour hath brought up in the sight of the
Court, as so many Hostages of their Fathers fidelity: so that this Castle, though as big as
a considerable City, yet is so full of people, that the Streets can hardly contain them.
                  When the Emperour goes out of his Palace,The Emperours Retinue. he either rides on horse-back, or is carried in
a Palanquin, open of all sides, and he is accompany'd by a great number of Lords, whom
they call the Emperours Camarades. These Lords are of great quality, and very rich, yet
do they not think it any dishonour, to apply themselves to such things as are either necessary
or delightful. Some are skill'd in Musick, some in Physick, some are excellent at Writing,
or Painting, others study eloquence and the mannagement of Affairs. Next them
there goes a part of the Guard, which consists altogether of persons cull'd out among the
Children of younger Brothers, Cousins, or Kinsmen of great Lords, among whom there
are also some natural Children of such as either actually are in employments, or may, upon
presumption of their Birth, pretend thereto. Then follow the ordinary Guard, commanded
by their Colonels and other Officers, who so dispose thereof, that two or three
thousand march before the Emperour, and as many after him. Among so many Souldiers,
there is not one but there hath been some trial made of his courage, nor any that hath
not gone through all the necessary exercises, in order to such a kind of life, and whose countenance
and demeanour is not answerable to the employment they are put into. They
leave a space between them and the Emperour for a great number of other great Lords,
who are about his Majesties person, who must needs make a strange shew, among five or six
hundred Men, all clad in black, some on horse-back, some afoot, all marching with such gravity,
and so orderly, that there is not only any one man to be seen out of his rank, but a
man hears not so much as a word spoken. The Streets are swept, and strew'd with Sand
or Gravel, and the doors of all the houses standing open: yet is there not a person to be
seen, either in the shops, or at the windows; or if it happen there be, the Guard makes
them kneel till such time as the Emperour is passed by.
                  Once every five year,The Dayro the Emperour goes to Meaco, to do reverence to the Dayro, who is
the true Prince of Iapan, and still hath the quality, but without any function. There is a
whole year spent in making all things ready for that journey, whereof we shall hereafter
give a particular description, and Orders are issued out to the Lords who are to follow,
and who accordingly come at the day appointed to the places where they are to meet the
King; dividing themselves so, as that some go before, to relieve such as come from the
Court, so to prevent the disorder and confusion, which were unavoidable among so great a
number of Princes, who are all oblig'd to make their appearance upon this occasion, with
all the bravery and magnificence they can.
                  From the City of Iedo, to that of Meaco, there are a hundred and twenty five Leagues,
and within every three or four Leagues there is a considerable City,The Emperours magnificence. able to lodge the whole
Court; yet hath the Emperour caused to be built between those two places, at an equal
distance one from the other, eight and twenty fair Houses, of which there  twenty great
Castles, and in every House there is a Retinue, and  else befitting a Kings Court,
as Gentlemen, Guards, Horses, Officers, and Servants, with Provisions necessary for the subsistance
of the whole Train. They who go along with the Emperour, from the City of
Iedo, leave him to the care of those whom they find in the first House; These accompany
and conduct him to the second; and so from one to another, till he comes to the City of
Meaco; in his return from whence, he observes the same order, being attended from one
House to another, till he comes to Iedo.
                  The Emperours of Iapan build many of these Castles, and have them finish'd in so
short a time, that they will have a Structure compleated in six moneths, which in Europe
would take up as many years. We have an Instance of it in the Castle which the Emperour
had built in the year 1636. in the Province of Nicko, four dayes journey from the City
of Iedo. It is fortified with a double Moat, and a double Rampier, and both of Free-stone,
and it is so spacious, and consists of so many particular Palaces, for the Grandees of
the Court, and so many Appartments, Gardens and Fountains for the Emperour himself,
that the best Architect in Europe would not have finish'd it in several years; yet

was this great building compleated in less than five months: there were so many Masons,
Carpenters, Joyners, Stone-cutters, Gilders, Painters, &c. employ'd about it. This Castle
is so far within the Countrey, that the Emperour lodges there but once a year, when he goes
to do his Devotions at his Father's Sepulchre, which is thereabouts, upon which occasion
he stays there two nights.
                  His Treasures are so great,His Treasures. that it is impossible to give any thing near an exact account
of it, inasmuch as the Gold and Silver is lock'd up in Chests, and dispos'd into the Towers
of the Castle, besides what is in several places, up and down the Countrey, where it increases
almost to infinity, since the Revenue of two months, will defray the charges of a whole
years expence. The late Emperour, Father to him who now reigns, lying on his death-bed,
call'd for his Son, and told him, That the Kingdom, and all the Treasures would
beere long at his disposal, but he recommended to his particular care certain Chests and
Cabinets, where he should find the ancient Chronicles of the Kingdom, and several excellent
Books of Morality, as also the Crown-jewels, exhorting him highly to esteem them,
as himself and his Predecessours had done, The pieces he had so much recommended to
his Son, were, one kind of Cymitar, called Iejuky Massamme; another Cymitar, of a kind called
Samoys; one other lesser Cymitar, called Bongo Doyssiro; A little Pot for Tsia, or The,
called Naraissiba; another greater Tsia Pot, called Stengo, and a Manuscript, intituled
AVC KOKI KINDOI. He left his elder Brother, the King of Ouwary, a Picture
called Darma, which was to be look'd on only of the one side, and a Cymitar, called
Massamme. To his second Brother, the King of Kinoonny, a Cymitar, called Iessa Massamme,
and a Picture, wherein were represented a great number of Frogs; and to the third
Brother, King of Mico, a Cymitar, called Sandame, and a Manuscript, named Sinche. And
though his six Pieces are not to be compar'd to those he bequeath'd his Son, yet not any
one of them but was valued at above a thousand Oebans of Gold, which amount to forty
seven thousand Thayls, or crowns. The Legacies he gave several Princes and Princesses of
the Blood, and other Lords and Ladies, as also to some of the Soldiery, and his Servants,
amounted to thirty six millions.
                  The Emperour who now reigns,The Emperour of Japan is a vice-roy. was not married when he came to the Crown upon the
death of his Father, which proceeded from his detestable addiction to Sodomy; insomuch
that the Dayro, perceiving the aversion he had conceiv'd for women was such, that
the State would in all likelihood come to be without a Governour, made choice, among
his nearest kindred, and the best qualifi'd Princesses of the Kingdom, of two young Ladies,
of extraordinary beauty, whom he sent to the Emperour, itreating him to take one
of them, and honour her with the quality of Miday, which is that they give the Emperours
lawful wife. He was so compliant as to marry one of them; but his brutality had
so debauch'd him, that he treated her with such indifference, that it brought her into a
melancholy which had almost cost her her life. Her Nurse troubled to see her in that condition,
took one day the freedom to tell the King, that she could not comprehend, how
he could slight one of the greatest beauties in the world, to pursue those irregular enjoyments,Conines hi Wife to a Castle,
which cannot be had without violence to nature. The Emperour, who before was
merry and in a good humour, was so troubled at this discourse, that going immediately
into another room, he sent for several Architects and Undertakers of Buildings, and commanded
them to build a Castle fortifi'd with several Moats and Draw-bridges, and very
high Walls, in which he confin'd his Wife, with her Nurse, and all the Women and Maids
belonging to them. The Emperour's own Nurse, who had a greater influence upon him,
then his Mother, perceiving that there would be a want of Heirs to inherit the Crown,
bethought her of a course to remedy that inconvenience, which was, to get to Court all the
handsomest young maids in the Kingdom, whom she produced, as often as the Emperour's
good humour gave her occasion or encouragement to do it. Of all she brought, only the
Daughter of an Armourer insinuated her self into his affection, and was got with child
by him; but the other Ladies troubled to see a maid of so mean quality preferr'd before
them, found means to corrupt the midwife, and to kill the child, so secretly, that the
Emperour never had the least knowledge thereof.
                  We have it from the Chronicles of Iapan,How the Emperour of Japan came to th Crown. that that great State hath always been govern'd
by a Monarch, whom in their Language they call Dayro, and that his Subjects had so great
a veneration for their Prince, that they thought it a crime to b wanting in point of respect
towards him, so far were they from taking up Arms to disturb the Peace of the Countrey.
His person was accounted so sacred, that they would not have it touch the ground, or that
he should be uncover'd abroad. Whence it came, that when the other Princes were engag'd
in a war one against another, there was a General named, who acted in the Dayro's
name, and reduc'd the Rebells to their duty. They have still the same respect for the

Dayro, insomuch, that they permit not that his hair or beard should be cut, or his nails
par'd, nor his meat to be dress'd in Pots that had been used before. He hath twelve Wives,
which are bestowed on him with extraordinary Ceremonies and Magnificence. When ever
he goes abroad, his twelve Wives follow him in so many Coaches, which are gilt and enriched
with their Arms and devises. They are lodg'd in twelve great Pallaces, built in the
street which goes to the King's Palace, and having adjoyning to them several other fair houses
for his Concubines. Not one of these Women, but hath a great Supper made every
night at her Palace, at which there is Musick, and the Women-dancers; but assoon as the
King is gone into that Palace where he intends to pass away the night, they all send in
their suppers, and have their divertisements at that Ladies Lodgings, whom the King is
pleas'd to honour with his presence.
                  One of the greatest Ceremonies and Magnificences to be seen in Iapan,Ceremonies at the choic of a Nurse for the Dayro's son. is that performed
at the birth of a Prince, who is to inherit the dignity of a Dayro For, to chuse a
Nurse for the Child, they get together fourscore of the handsomest young Women in the
Kingdom, whom they present to the Twelve VVives of the Dayro, and to nine of the greatest
Lords of the Countrey, and of nearest kin to the Dayro, who, for want of Issue male,
might succeed him. These Princes and Ladies receive those designed for this employment,
give them extraordinary Titles, and treat them a whole day together. The next day the
foresaid number is reduc'd to the moyety, and one half is dismiss'd, with very great Presents.
The next day, they add to the Titles of those who stay, with great Ceremonies, and
their number is reduc'd to ten, and afterwards to three, the rest being still dismiss'd with
Presents, and at the end of three days, they make choyce of one of these three, on whom
they bestow, besides several other Titles, the quality of the Prince's Nurse. In order to
her establishment in that Function, she is brought into the Prince's Chamber, whom she
finds in the arms of one of the chiefest Ladies of the Countrey, by whom he had been kept
from the time of his birth; and after the Nurse hath spurted a little of her milk into the
Childes mouth, he is delivered up to her. All these Ceremonies, as also those performed
at the ordinary Feasts, are very great, and they are at this day performed with the Dayro,
who still enjoys a very considerable Revenue, sufficient to defray all the charge, and continues
the same grandeur his Predecessours have been possess'd of, though the force of the
Empire hath been devolv'd into other hands, as we shall now relate.
                  The charge of General of the Army was heretofore the greatest of any in the Kingdom,A revolution in Japan
as is that of Constable, in France; and it was invested ordinarily, though contrary to the
rules of good policy, in the second Son of the Dayro. About a hundred and twenty
years since, it happened there was a Dayro, who having a son he exceedingly doted on,
would needs out of an imprudent compliance he had for the Mother, consent that he should
participate of the Royal Dignity; and it was ordered that it should pass alternately from
one to the other, every three years. But the son willing to make his advantage of the
occasion, found means so to insinuate himself into the affections of the great Lords and the
Soldiery, during the three years of his Reign, that he resolv'd to continue it, contrary to
the exhortations of his Father, who too late repented him of his devesting himself of an
authority which indeed is not communicable. This was the first disturbance that ever
had been seen in Iapan, inasmuch as both Father and Son being equally invested with the
quality of Dayro, the people conceived they might, without any crime, take up Arms for
either: However most of the Lords detesting the ingratitude of the Son, joyn'd with the
General, whom the Father had appointed to reduce his Son to obedience, who was defeated
and killed in that Civil warr. The General, finding himself well established in his
charge, followed the example of the Prince, and abusing the lawful power, whereof he
was seized, made his advantage of it to settle himself in the Throne, after the Dayro's death,
yet leaving the lawful heir, with the quality of Dayro, all the outward appearance of his
former greatness. This demeanour of the Generall's occasioned a second Civil warre,
which was thought the more just, out of this respect, that in this the people took up
Arms against an Usurper, who had not the quality of Dayro, nor consequently the Character,
for which the Iaponnesses have so great a veneration. Accordingly, this war had
the same success with the former;A Souldier of Fortune gets to be General of the Army. for the Usurper was defeated and executed. But this
second General took the same course as his Predecessour had done, so that by this second
Usurpation, the Countrey was reduced to an absolute Anarchy, wherein all were Masters;
there being no Prince, nor Lord, nay hardly a Village, but was engaged in war
against some other. These disorders gave occasion to a Soldier of Fortune, named Taycko,
to appear at first, in the head only of fifty men, with whom he did such exploits, that
he soon improved that handful to a very considerable Army.
                  His first adventures were the taking in of several Castles and small Cities; but within

a while after, his thoughts flew much higher, and he proved so fortunate in his designs,
that within less then three years,And Soveraign. he became absolute Master of the whole State. He left
the Dayro the external part of his former greatness, and thought it enough to be in effect,
what the other was only in appearance. The Dayro, on the other side, perceiving it was
impossible for him to prevent that establishment, comply'd therewith, and chang'd the quality
of General of the Army to that of Emperour. Taycko, who could not expect much quietness
in his newly acquired fortune, if he removed not those Lords of whom he conceived
any jealousie, resolved to keep them at a distance from the Court; and to that end, he sent
the chiefest of them with an Army of sixty thousand men, into the Countrey of Corea, with
order not to return thence till they had conquered that Province. They there met with
such resistance, that they were near seven years reducing that Nation to obedience: Taycko
in the mean time feeding them with fair hopes, and animating them to prosecute
a design of so great concernment to the State. They were forc'd to obey; but being
impatient to return to their own habitations, they committed such exorbitances as made
the Inhabitants of Corea desperate; insomuch, that not able any longer to endure the burning
of their houses, the murthers, and other violences done them; they sent an Embassadour
to the Court,I poyson'd. who to deliver his Country out of the miseries it had suffered for so
many years, made a shift to poyson Taycko, who some days after dyed. The Army in Corea
was immediately disbanded, and the Lords who had the command of it, return'd to
their several homes.
                  Taycko being on his death-bed,Besto the Regency on one of the Lords. and considering with himself that he could not hope
to derive the succession to his Son, who was but six years of age, if he made not some
powerful Person Protector, during his Minority, sent to Ongosschio, one of the greatest
Lords of the Country, desiring him to undertake the tuition of that young Prince. Ongosschio
accepted it, and to give Taycko the greatest assurance he could expect, that he
would be faithful to him, promised him, by an act signed with his blood, that he would
deliver up the Crown to Fidery, (so was the young Prince called) assoon as he were
come to the fifteenth year of his age, and that he should be Crown'd Emperour, by the
Dayro. The disorders of the late Civil Warrs were yet fresh in every mans memory, so
that there was a general joy conceiv'd, to see the Regency in the hands of a person, excellently
qualified for the execution thereof. Ongosschio was indeed a person of very great endowments,
but he had withal too much spirit and ambition to be reduced to a private life,
after he had been possessed of the Soveraign Power for so many years. He had obliged Fidery
to marry his Daughter, yet could not so near an alliance smother so that predominant
passion in him. Whence it came that he immediately gave out, that Fidery was
grown so distrustful of him, that he was forc'd to stand upon his guard, and to raise an
Army to oppose that which Fidery was going to get together against him. He gave out
also that Fidery would needs be treated as Emperour, and discharge the Functions thereof,
before the Dayro had acknowledged him to be such, or Crown'd him in that quality.
Accordingly he took his march with a powerful Army, raised in the Kingdom of Suruga,
towards the City of Ozacka, where Fidery lived, and after a siege of three months, reduced
him to so great extremities, that Fidery sent his Wife, who as we said before, was
Ongosschio's daughter, to intreat her Father to grant him his life, and to sign him such
Lands in any Province of the Kingdom as he should think fit, where he might live
privately: But Ongosschio would not see his daughter, and continuing his siege, he became
at last Master of the Castle.
                  The unfortunate Fidery being got,Puts to death the Heir of the Cown. with his wives, and several other persons of Quality,
in one of the Palaces; Ongosschio ordered it to be compassed about with great piles of
wood, which being set on fire, the Pallace and all within was reduced to ashes. He put
to death all the Lords who had sided, or held any correspondency with Fidery, and by
that means established himself the sole Monarch of that State, as Taycko, his Predecessour,
had done before him. Ongosschio died the year following, and left the Empire in quiet,
to his Son Combo, or Combosamme, the Father of Chiongon, who now Reigns.
                  It is no hard matter for the Emperour of Iapan to raise and keep an Army on foot,The Emperour of Japan raises h Armies upon the charge of h Subjects in
regard all his Subjects are obliged to bring in and maintain a certain number of Soldiers,
proportionably to their Revenue. For he who hath a thousand Kockiens, or four thousand
Crowns per annum is obliged to maintain twenty foot and two horse-men; and according
to this accompt, the Lord of Firando, (where the Dutch made their first establishment)
who hath sixty thousand Kockiens of yearly Revenue, was tax'd at twelve hundred foot,
and one hundred and twenty horse, besides the servants, slaves, and what else is consequent
thereto. So that by this means, according to the Revenues of the Lords we mentioned before,
which amount to eighteen millions, and four hundred thousand Kockiens, the Emperour

of Iapan may raise an Army of three hundred sixty eight thousand foot, and thirty
eight thousand eight hundred horse,Can raise 368000. foot, and 38800. horse. not accounting the hundred thousand foot and twenty
thousand horse, which he is able to maintain out of his own Revenue, and which he
keeps as a standing Army, for the defence of his Castles and strong places, and for his Guards.
                  Most of these Lords find it no great trouble to make their Levies, for there are few of
them but ordinarily maintain twice as many Soldiers, out of an humour they have to make
great showes, especially upon those occasions wherein they expect to give some assurances
of their courage or zeal they have for the service of their Prince.
                  Their Cavalry is armed with Corselets,Their Arms. but the Foot have only Head-pieces. The offensive
Arms of the Horse are a sort of Fire-locks, not much longer then our Pistols, half-pikes,
Bowes, Arrows, and Cimitars. The foot wear every man two Cimitars, and have
Muskets, Pikes, and Nanganets, or half-pikes, and every man hath about him a very broad
Knife. Their Companies consist but of fifty Soldiers, who are commanded by a Captain,
a Lieutenant,Their Companies and Regiments. and ten Corporals, to wit, a Corporal for every five Soldiers. Five Companies
make a Body, which is commanded by another Officer, and every fifty Companies have
their Colonel. The Emperour of Iapan hath the same course taken, to know every year
how many persons there is in his Kingdom. For every quarter of a City or Village is divided
into Cantons, consisting of five houses, which are commanded by a certain Officer,
who keeps a Register or Catalogue of all those who die or are born within the five houses
under his jurisdiction, and reports the same to his superiours, who give an account thereof
to the Prince or Lord of the Province; and these last to two Counsellors of State, who
are appointed for that purpose.
                  The Council of State consists of several Lords,The Council of State. who have each of them his particular
function, excepting only the four chiefest, who are every day punctually at Court to give
the Emperour an account of affairs. All the rest are so powerful and rich, that some among
them have above two millions of yearly Revenue, others three or four hundred thousand
Crowns, others but forty or fifty thousand. They are very reserv'd in the advice they give
the Emperour, to whom they speak not, even of affairs, if they find him not in a good
humour to hear them: but none will presume to speak to him twice of the same thing,
or renew his intreaties, after a refusal. This Council consists of such Lords as the Emperour
may be the more confident of, in regard they have commonly their education at the
Court. These have the management of all publick affairs, but with such dependance on
the Soveraign's pleasure, that they do not only never resolve on any things of themselves,
but indeed they never speak to the Prince, till he gives them some occasion to do it, and
that they have first consulted his eyes, and studied his countenance, to find what his sentiments
are. They ever approve what he says, though never so prejudicial to himself,
even to the loss of a whole Province; for the least contestation would cost them their fortunes,
if not their lives.
                  From what we said before,The expences of great Lords. it is evident, that the Reyenues of these Lords are very
great; but their Expences are as great. For, first, not one of them but is obliged to
live one halfe of the year at Court, and, during that time, to keep house in the chief City of
Iedo, where he who lives at the highest rate is most in favour with the Emperour. The
first six months in the year, those Lords who have their Principalities and Lordships
in the Easterly and Northerly Provinces of the Kingdom, continue at the Court, and the
other six months, those that live in the Western and Southern Provinces. At their coming
to the Court, and their departure thence, they make very considerable Presents to the
Emperour, and great Entertainments among themselves. Their Journeys and their
Expences at Court, whither some Lords bring a Retinue of five or six thousand persons,
lie very heavy on the richest, and ruine the rest. The Lord of Firando, who, as we
said, was one of the meanest, had in his Family, above three hundred men, and maintain'd
in the two houses he had at Iedo, above a thousand persons, comprehending in that
number the VVomen and Concubines he kept, as did also the other Lords, in one of
his two houses.
                  Provisions are dear enough all over Iapan,Provisions dear. but at an excessive rate about the Court,
by reason of the abundance consumed by so great a number of persons of quality. Another
way to exhaust their Estates is, their magnificence in Building, there being still somewhat
wanting in their appartments, either as to Painting or Gilding, or the like. Most of
their Domesticks go in Silk, especially their Women, and those of their own sex that
wait on them: so that there is hardly any Lord but spends more then his Revenue amounts
to. But what helps to ruine them, is the Order they receive from the Emperour, to supply
him, ever and anon, with men and mony, to carry on the publick Buildings, which he
does rather to drain the Purses of these Lords, then out of any necessity obliging him thereto.
                  
                     
The greatest Lords, when they build a Pallace, do ordinarily make two Gates thereto,
one for their own use,The  of the  in their buildings. and the other for the Emperours passage into it. The latter is much
larger then the other, and made all of Joyner's work, excellently varnish'd, carv'd into
branch-work, and gilt. Assoon as it is hish'd it is cover'd with boards, against the injury
of the weather, and is not uncover'd, till near the time of the Emperour intends to honour
the house with his presence, to dine there; and assoon as he is departed thence, it is shut up,
and so kept ever after, out of this respect, that having serv'd for a passage to the Emperour's
Sacred Majesty, it were a profanation, if any private person should pass through it after him.
It is also to be observ'd that the Emperour never dines above once in any house belonging
to another man, and that they are three whole years in making all things ready for his Entertainment.
Accordingly he hath notice of it, three years before, and in the mean time
all the furniture of the house is made and marked,Three years requisite to  an entrance for the Emperour. as is also all the Plate, with the Arms
and Characters of the Emperour; and after that time they are never more used, but kept
very safe, as things not to be employed in any thing, after they have once served the
Soveraigns person. So that this Expence, and that which they are at in the Entertainment,
which the Master of that House is obliged to make for the whole Court, for three
months together, were enough to beggar an ordinary King.
                  Another thing lies heavy on these Lords, is, the Presents which the Emperour makes
them. For upon his return from his ordinary Hunting, which is that of the Crane, a bird
there very highly esteemed, he is wont to send some of those he hath taken, to such as he
hath most kindness for. But that Present costs him at least half a years Revenue, in Feasts,
Presents, and other publick Entertainments, which he is obliged to make in acknowledgment
of the favour done him by his Majesty, in sending him a Bird taken by a Hawk
put off from his Sacred Hands. It is not long since, that the Lord of Zatiuma treated
the Emperour at a Dinner, in a Palace which was then but newly finished; but he got
well by the expence he had been at. For the Emperour made him a Present for his Horses,
(so they call the Gratifications he makes his Favourites) by an addition to his former
Revenue, of two hundred and fifty thousand Crowns per annum.
                  The Grandees never take any Wife,The Emperour marries all the great Lords. but what they have from the Emperours hands;
and it is of her alone who is given by him, that the Children are to be born, who are to
inherit their Estates. Accordingly, they look on her and respect her as the person from
whom they expect Heirs for the propagation of their Family, and upon that account, recommended
to them by the Emperour. He who expects to have this honour done him
builds a Palace purposely for her reception, furnishes it very richly, and allows her a Retinue
consisting of a great number of Women and Maids, to accompany her, and wait on her.
                  Women go not abroad but once a year,The women kept in restraint. to give their Relations a Visit, and then they
are seen in the streets, with a Retinue of thirty, forty, or fifty close Palanquins, wherein
are carried so many Maids of Honour, accompanied each of them by their Waiting Gentlewomen,
and other Women, marching in a File on both sides of the Palanquins, which
are varnished over and gilt. All the remainder of the year, the women stir not out of their
houses, into which there are not any men permitted to enter, save only some of the Wives
nearest Relations, who sometimes have the freedom to see them, but very seldom, and that
in their Husbands presence. It is his business on the other side to make the restraint as little
burthensom as may be to them, by allowing them all the divertisements and recreations,
which honest women can take; finding them Gardens and Parks for walking, Ponds for
fishing, keeping all sorts of living Creatures for their pleasure, and entertaining them
every day with Musick and Plays. But they must expect to end their days in this restraint,
and renounce the conversation of men, inasmuch as the least suspition is here as unpardonably
punished with death, as any other manifest crime; not only in the person of the
Lady, but also in all about her. Her Attendants are commonly some of the handsomest
young Gentlewomen in the Province, who always stand before the Master and Mistress
with such respect, that they study to answer, laugh, and hold their peace, upon the least
sign made them. They are ordinarily distinguished into Bands or Companies, consisting
of sixteen Gentlewomen, who have each a Governess over them. They are clad in Silk,
flower'd painted, or embroidered, of different colours or liveries. For one Band is in a
red livery, with girdles and head-cloathes of a green colour; another, white, with girdles
and head-cloathes red; another, yellow, with girdles and head-cloaths of a sky-colour, and
so of the rest. The Gentlewomen, who are received into the service of these Princesses,
at fifteen or twenty years of age, oblige themselves, most of them, for the remainder of
their lives; but such as are taken into it while they are yet children, are sometimes afterwards
married to Gentlemen, Soldiers, or others of the menial Servants, who have some
Office about the House, and whose Allowances are upon that Account augmented: but such
as are not married at thirty, must not expect to change their condition, otherwise then by

being advanced to some more honourable Employments among the women.
                  It is the custom of the Countrey,Women never talk of business. that Women should be instructed betimes, not to meddle
with any kind of business whatsoever, insomuch that they never speak of any such thing
to their Husbands. These, on the otherside, make it their brag, that they are enabled
with such a strength of parts and understanding, as to leave all serious thoughts behind
them, at their own Lodgings, when they leave those to go into the appartment of their
Wives, where their discourse is altogether of mirth and divertisement. If a Woman
should trouble her Husband with the least discourse about business, she would immediately
put him out of humour, make him change his countenance, and oblige him to retire,
without so much as speaking to her. But this she will be sure to avoid, though out of
no other motive then this, that another might not have those enjoyments of him, which
she by her imprudence would deprive her self of. For they affirm, that a woman is bestow'd
on man mearly to serve, and divert him, and to mind the education of his Children,
and that herein consists all her duty, and that there are but too many Examples of the mischiefs
happening through the excessive freedom heretofore allowed to women.
                  The Wives of Iapan have the reputation of being extreamly faithful to their Husbands,
and so modest and reserv'd, that none any where else come near them. Of this many instances
might be produced: but confining our selves to the relation of a particular man's
Travels, wherein these digressions must needs be thought tedious, we shall here produce
only two or three, of many others, that happend much about the time we speak of.
                  The King or Prince of the Province of Fingo,The generosity of a aponnese Wife. hearing that a Gentleman of the Country
had a very handsom woman to his wife, got him dispatch'd out of the way, and having
sent for the Widdow, some days after her Husband's death, acquainted her with his desires.
She told him, that though she had much reason to be glad, and think her self happy,
in being honour'd with the friendship of so great a Prince, yet was she resolved to bite
off her Tongue, and murder her self, if he proffer'd her any violence; but if he would
grant her but one favour, which was to spend one month in bewailing her Husband, and
then give her the liberty to make an Entertainment for the relations of the deceased, to take
her leave of them, he should find how much she was his Servant, and how far she would
comply with his affection. The Prince, who thought himself sure enough of her, made
no difficulty to do what the Gentlewoman desired of him, and having provided a very great
dinner, at the place where she desired it might be, all the kindred of the deceased came thither,
but it was only to be witnesses of the fidelity which she expressed to her husband
after his death: For the Gentlewoman perceiving the King began to be warm in his wine,
out of the hope he was in to enjoy what had been promised him, desired the liberty to
withdraw into an adjoyning Gallery to take the Air; but assoon as she was come into it,
she cast her self headlong down, in the presence of the King, and all her husbands Relations.
                  Much about the same time,An example of modesty in a . it hapned that a young gentlewoman, being on her knees at
the end of a Table, waiting on her Master, in the appartment of the Women, and overreaching
her self to take a flaggon that stood a little too far from her, she chanced to let
wind backwards, which she was so much asham'd of, that putting her Garment over her
head, she would by no means shew her face after, but with an enrag'd violence taking one
of her nibbles into her mouth, she bit it off with such fury, that she died in the place.
                  Another Lord,Another example of modestie. having had an exact search made for all the handsome young Damosels
in his Province, to be dispos'd into his Ladies service, there was among the rest brought
him one whom he was so much taken with, that he made her his Concubine. She was the
Daughter of a poor Soldiers widdow, who hoping to make some advantage of her daughters
good fortune, took occasion one day, to write her a large letter, wherein she express'd
what a necessitous condition she was in, and how she was forc'd to sue to her for relief.
While the Daughter was reading her Mother's Letter, her Lord comes into the room; but
being asham'd to discover her Mothers poverty, she endeavours to hide the Letter from
him, yet could she not convey it away so, as that the other did not perceive it. The disorder
he observ'd in the Gentlewoman's countenance, made him suspect there might be
some design in it, insomuch, that he pressed her to shew him the Letter; but the more
importunate he was, the more unwilling she was to satisfie him; so perceiving there was no
way to avoid it, she thrust it into her mouth, with so much precipitation that thinking to
swallow it down, it choaked her. This so incensed the Lord; that he immediately commanded
her throat to be cut, whereby they discovered only the Mothers Poverty, and the
Daughters innocence. He was so moved thereat, that he could not forbear expressing it by
tears; and it being not in his power to make any other Demonstrations of his affection to
the deceased; he sent for the Mother, who was maintained among his other Ladies, at
the time we speak of, with all imaginable respect.
                  
                     
They are generally so reserv'd in their conversation,The reservedness of their conversotien. that their discourses are not only
far from being guilty of any obscene or impertinent expression, but also they will not so
much as talk of marriage, or ought relating thereto, even in honourable terms, in the presence
of young people, who, when there is any such thing spoken of, immediately rise and
go out of the Room. The Children have a great tenderness and respect for their Parents,
as being perswaded there is no sin more severely punished by the Gods, then the disobedience
of Children. They have also a certain veneration for their memory after their decease;
for they religiously observe those fasting dayes they impose upon themselves of
their own accord, abstaining from whatever hath had life, upon those dayes of the moneth,
on which their Parents departed this World.
                  As they are very severe in restraining their Wives and Concubines of even the least liberty,They are jealous.
so are they excessively cruel in punishing those which are not careful to preserve
their honours, or give the least suspition of their inclinations to be dishonest. It is not
long since that the Lord of Firando caused three Ladies to be put into so many Chests,
through which there were Nails struck in of all sides, one, for having prostituted her self
to a Gentleman, who ripp'd up his own belly as soon as their familiarity was discovered;
and the other two, because they had been privy to their Loves, and had not acquainted
him therewith. He who finds a Man lock'd up in the same Room with his Wife, may
kill them both; and in the Husbands absence, the Father, Brother, or any other Kinsman,
nay, any one of the menial Servants may do as much: and by this means, they so
avoid those scandals, which are but too frequent elsewhere, that a man seldom hears of
Adultery among them; in so much that I do not remember I ever heard of any more then
one Example, which being a remarkable one, I shall not think it much to insert it
here.
                  A certain Merchant,Adultery severely punished. who had some reason to suspect his Wife, pretended to go into the
Country, but returning soon after, surpriz'd her in the very act. The Adulterer he killed,
and having ty'd his Wife to a Ladder, he left her in that half-hanging posture all night.
The next day he invited all their Relations on both sides, as well Men as Women, to dine
with him at his own house, sending them word, that the importance of the business he had
to communicate to them, excused his not-observance of the custom they have, to make
Entertainments for the Women, distinct from those of the Men. They all came, and
wondered not much that the Mistress of the house was not to be seen, in regard her Husband
told them that she was busie in the Kitchin: but dinner being well-nigh past, and
the Guests perceiving the Woman appear'd not, they intreated him to send for her, which
he promised to do. Whereupon rising from the Table, and going into the Room, where
she was ty'd to the Ladder, he unbound her, put a Shrowd about her, and put into her
hands a Box of Lacque, wherein were the Privy-members of her Gallant, cover'd with
Flowers, charging her not to open the Box, and saying to her, Go and present this Box to
our common Relations, and see whether I may, upon their meditation, grant you your life.
She came in that equipage into the Hall where they sate at dinner, and falling on her knees
presented the Box, with the precious Reliques within it, to the Kindred: but as soon as
they had opened it, she swounded. Her Husband perceiving it, went to her, and to prevent
her returning again, now that she was going, cut off her Head; which raised such
an horror in the Friends, that they immediately left the Room, and went to their several
homes.
                  To prevent these disorders,Fornication permitted. they have in their common Inns upon the Road, as also in
certain
places in Cities, the convenience of furnishing Travellers with a kind of Women,
who are for the most part Slaves, but very well clad in Silk, and make no difficulty to proffer
themselves to keep men company all night. These have the Custom of Masters of Ships
and common Sea-men that are Forreigners; but if they will bid at a little higher Game,
and be more sure of their enjoyments, they may buy a concubine, with whom they contract
for the time they are to stay in the Country; allowing them five or six pence a day
towards their diet, a Garment or two, certain pair of Shooes of Cordevant, and about eight
or ten Crowns, for the Father, or Master, who lets her out.
                  We are so far from charging this Nation with being over-superstitious,They have no Devotion. that on the other
side, we affirm, that there is no mark of Devotion to be observed among them. Those who
are conceived to have very much, go once a moneth to their Pagodes, and pronounce several
times the word Nammanda, which is the name of one of their Gods; but they are
never seen praying to God, neither morning nor evening, nor at any time of the day. There
is a certain Sect among them, which hath Priests, who preach thrice a year, to which Sermons
all those of the same perswasion resort. There are also some who make use of another
kind of Ecclesiasticks, especially in their long diseases, wherein they have prayers

made, which last twenty four hours, with such a noise, that they stunne such as come near
them, who yet cannot understand one word they say; not only in regard they pronounce
ill and confusedly; but hence, that whatever they compose, as well in matter of Religion
as Medicine, and the other Sciences, is couched in such high and obscure terms, that many
times they understand them not themselves.
                  Notwithstanding this irreligion,Their Pagodes and Priests. there are in Iapan an incredible number of Pagodes or
Mesquites, some of which have fifteen or twenty Priests belonging to them. They are
distinguished from the Laicks in that their Heads are shaved, as also by their cloathing, in
as much as they go in a kind of Cassock, made like the Frocks worn by some Country
people: but upon Holidayes they go in a sort of long Garments, which they sold up under
the left Arm, like a Cloak. Their principal employment is to pray before their Gods,
and to bury the dead, or at least the ashes of such bodies as have been burnt. They are
divided into several Sects, and consequently have so many different wayes of doing their
Devotions, especially on the Anniversary dayes of the deceased, which they call Bom, on
which the Priests are employed in praying and singing Letanies, in making Processions about
a Chappel set about with Wax-lights, much after the same manner as is done in some
parts of Europe. Their Sepulchres are near their Pagodes, covered with great Stones, two
or three foot high, on which such as go to do their Devotions there cast Flowers, or branches
of Trees, and put into a little Pit, made in the ground, some fair Water and a little
Rice, which is taken away thence by the poor. Persons of Quality erect a little Pillar
near their Sepulchres, and grave thereon their names, with a certain Elogy, which serves for
an Epitaph.
                  Their Ecclesiasticks are divided into twelve principal Sects,Distinguished into several Sects. of which eleven eat not
of any thing that hath had life, and make a Vow of Chastity, with so strict an Obligation
for the observance thereof, that if they break it, though in never so small a point, they are
put to the most cruel death that ever was heard of. For the Priest who hath broken his
Vow is put into the ground up to the Waste,A cruel kind of death. near the High-way; and all that pass by, who
are not nobly descended, are obliged to give a little stroke upon his Neck with a wooden
Saw, which being very blunt makes the Wretch languish three or four dayes together.
This course is taken with them, upon this account, that being permitted to use Sodomy,
they may forbear Women.
                  The Priests of the twelfth Sect live after another rate. For it is lawful for them to feed
on any thing that Earth or Water affords, as also to marry: and yet this Sect, which they
call Icko, whence the Priests, whereof it consists, are named Ickois, is accounted the holiest,
and most perfect of them all. He who is Head of this Sect, is also Supream Head of all
the Clergy of the Country, and is in so great veneration among his followers, that they
do not only carry him in a Palanquin, but indeed do him such honours as are almost Divine.
All the Priests depend on the Dayro, who still hath the same power over the Ecclesiasticks,
as he had heretofore, joyntly, with the secular power. Only such Pagodes as
belong to these last have a settled Revenue, and enjoy many Priviledges and Immunities
granted them by the Emperours. All the other Pagodes are maintain'd by what is given
them, either by way of Alms, or the Gratifications that they get from those who imploy
them about Prayers for the dead, wherein the main part of the exercise of their Religion
consists.
                  Some among them believe,Their opinion concerning the Soul. that the Soul is immortal, that the Body is reduced to its
first Principle, and becomes Dust and Ashes, but that the Spirit is either raised to eternal
joy, or condemn'd to an endless grief, and that at its return into this World, it shall find
good or evil, according to what it had done during this life. Others make no distinction
between the Souls of Men and those of Beasts, and as they have no knowledge of the
Worlds Creation, so are they ignorant that there is a time appointed for its dissolution. The
most zealous among them make no scruple to convert their Pagodes into Drinking-houses;
for, as they make choice of the most delightful places of the Country, for the Pagodes, so
they walk in them, and divert themselves, in the presence of their Gods, and have the company
of their Priests, drinking and debauching themselves to that height, that it proves the
occasion of many consequent disorders.
                  A man shall never,No disputes about Religion. in this Country, meet with any Controversies about Religion, nor
ever find that a Iapponese conceives himself any way obliged to instruct his Neighbour, or
shew him his Errour: but on the contrary, their indifference for these concernments is
generally so great, that some among them will not stick to change their Religion for a hundred
Crowns.
                  They have so irreconcilable an aversion for the Christians,They hae Christians. that, perceiving they went
chearfully to their deaths, when they only cut off their Heads, and crucified them after

their death, they have since found out such exquisite torments, to procure their more painful
departure, that, though they had resolution and constancy enough to endure them; yet
could they not express that insolence and insensibility, as to receive so greivous a death,
with the same alacrity they had discover'd at the ordinary Executions. There were indeed
some who sung amidst the Flames; but it would have been somewhat above humanity,
if they should not have groan'd in the torments they endured, when they were broild,
with a gentle Fire, upon Gridirons, or suffer'd to languish or several dayes together. Yet
did not all these courses much diminish the number of those Wretches; in so much that
these Monsters of barbarisme, perceiving that Death little frighten'd those who look'd on
it but as a passage to a better life,Diabolical inventions to put Christians to death. bethought themselves of other courses to be taken with
them. Young Maids, of any Quality, they caused to be stripp'd stark naked, to be publickly
violated, made them go on all four through the Streets, and dragg'd them through
rugged and uneven places, till their hands and knees were cut, and their bodies torn in several
places, and after all put them into Vats full of Serpents, which enter'd into their bodies
at all the open places, and so put them to a very painful death: yet was this done
with less horrour, then when they fill'd the privy parts of a Mother or a Daughter with
Match done over with Gun-powder, and bound about those of a Son or a Father with the
same, and forced the Son to set fire to that of the Mother, and the Father to that of his
Daughter. 'Twas a kind of favour shewn them, when they cover'd their bodies all over
with Turfs, and incessantly pour'd eething Water into their privy parts, till they expi'd
amidst those torments, which commonly dispatch'd them not in less then three or four
dayes. They drove great companies of them up and down the Country, and into Forrests,
stigmatiz'd in the foreheads, with prohibitions, upon pain of death, that any should give
them any sustenance or entertainment. Some were put into Cages upon the Sea-side, that
the Tide might come up to their chins, and at the return of the water they might recover
their spirits a little, to endure the greater torment at the next Floud. They bound the Fathers
and Mothers to a Post, and hood-winked them, while they put the Children to inconceivable
torments, which they being not able to endure, intreated their Parents with the
most importunate expressions they could imagine at that age, to deliver them out of their
pains, by renouncing. This was one of the most insupportable punishments of any they
invented, and which brought many to death and abjuration. Another torment they
had for those poor Children was, to pluck off their Nails, and to prick them with Bodkins
in the tenderest parts of their bodies. To make a discovery of Christians, they ordered,
that all the Inhabitants should once a year protest before their Pagodes, and sign a
certain Instrument, whereby they renounced Christian Religion; and by this means there
passed not a year, but a great number was discover'd. Such as were hung up by the feet,
and were continued in that posture for ten or twelve dayes, endured the greatest torment
of any, in regard the anguish of this punishment still increasing, there is no pain, not even
that of fire it self, comes near it.
                  These persecutions must needs have much diminish'd the number of Christians in Iapan;
but what most contributes to the destruction of Christian Religion, is a course they
have taken, to put the Christians to death, even though they proffer to renounce; so that
there is no way for any to avoid death, but by discovering another Christian, who may
endure it in their stead, and by that discovery they escape. However, there is an
exact Register kept of these Renegadoes, out of a design, as it is conceiv'd, one time
or other, to rid the Country of them, when the Executions must cease for want of
Christians.
                  About the same time there was a search made for Christians in all the Hospitals for Lepers,
where they found three hundred and eighty Christians, whom they sent away in two
Ships, to the Philippine Islands, as a Present to the Portuguez. The Leprosie is so common
a Disease in Iapan, that a man shall meet there with many, whose fingers and toes are so
rotted, that they fall off.
                  The Christians, who are conducted to punishment, are tied; but the Priests, whether
Castilians, Portuguez, or Iaponneses, are otherwise treated. They shave off one half of
their Heads and Beards, which they paint over with a red colour, put a Gag into their
Mouths, and a Halter about their Necks, which is tied to the Horse-tail, on which they are
brought to the place appointed for their execution.
                  Most of their Houses are built of Wood,Their Houses. sleightly enough, in regard the Country is very
much subject to Earthquakes. They are all raised three or four foot from the ground,
boarded and matted, and very handsom within, especially those Rooms where they reveive
their Visits. They are, for the most part, but one story high, in which they live, and the
rest serve for Corn-lofts. They have places distinct from their Houses, where they keep

their Merchandises, and what else they most esteem, in regard their Houses are so apt to
take fire, that they are forc'd to have Fats full of Water alwayes ready against such Accidents,
which are very frequent among them.
                  The Houses of Gentlemen and Souldiers are divided into two partitions, whereof one
is taken up by the Wife, who is never seen, and the other by the Husband, who hath his
Chambers and Halls for the reception of his friends and his business. The Wives of Citizens
and Merchants appear in the Shops, and have a care of the House; but they are treated
with so much respect, that none durst let fall a free or equivocal expression in their presence,
nay, a licentious one were criminal. Instead of Tapistry, they have a kind of Scenes
or Shutters, which serve them also for Pictures, whereof they cover the closures with Paper
painted and gilt, and so neatly pasted on, that the whole piece seems to consist but of one
sheet. These Shutters are made of very thin boards, and fall one into another, so as that
of two or three small Chambers, they can of a sudden make a very fair Hall. All these
little Rooms make a kind of Gallery, which serves equally for both the Appartments of
the Husband and Wife, and leads to a common Door to go into the Garden, which Door is
ordinarily opposite to the Hall-windows. In the midst of the Room there commonly
stands a Cabinet, on which they set a Pot of Flowers, which are there to be had all the
year long. They are very curious about their Gardens, and make them as pleasant as may
be, with Groves, Fountains, Orchards, and especially one kind of Tree, which is as green in
Winter as in Summer.
                  There is not much Houshold-Stuff to be seen in their Houses, in regard they bestow on
their Wives, the Trunks and Cabinets of Lacque, their rich Tapistry, and the like, or they
dispose them into some private Rooms, into which they admit only their most intimate
Friends. They are very expensive in their Pots for Cha, or Tsia, as also in Pictures, Pieces
excellent for the writing, and in Arms.
                  They are civil,They are civil. and entertain such as visit them with great Complements. Persons of
Quality make such as come to see them sit down, and present them with Tobacco and Tsia.
If the Master of the house hath a particular esteem for the Friend who visits him, he will
treat him with Wine, which is brought in a varnish'd Cup; and it were an incivility in
him, to whom this honour is done, to refuse it. They are not so reserv'd, but that sometimes
they will take a little more then they are well able to carry away; but seldom to that
height, as to do ought whereof they may repent the next day, or quarrel in their Drink;
for the perpetual apprehension they have of the unavoidable Death that would follow,
keeps them in, and sends them to bed with whole Skins.
                  In Cities, and upon the High-wayes, there are Inns, for the entertainment of Travellers
and Passengers, but otherwise there is not a Tipling-house, or Cooks-shop, in all Iapan.No drinking houses in Japan.
For though there are great lovers of good chear, and company keeping, yet have they not
any publick places for that purpose, but they meet at one anothers houses, and there spend
the time in good fellowship and drinking, and have a kind of Musick, which is not very
harmonious.Their Musick. They have but few Musical Instruments, and that most used among them,
and which they are most taken with, is a kind of Lute, the belly whereof is above a footsquare,
with a long and narrow neck, as being made only for four strings, which are of Silk,
and they strike them with a Peg of Ivory, about the bigness of a Mans singer. They sing
to it, but the voyce is as immelodious as the sound of the Instrument.
                  Their Wine they make of Rice,Their Wine. putting thereto some Sugar or Honey, and they call it
Moursack, or Saltse. It is a kind of Hydromel, rather then Wine, yet it is as strong as the
best Sack, and makes a Man drunk much sooner.
                  As for Tsia,Tsia, how prepared. it is a kind of The or Tea; but the Plant is much more delicate, and more
highly esteem'd then that of Th??. Persons of Quality keep it very carefully in Earthen-pots
well stopp'd and luted, that it may not take wind: but the Iaponneses prepare it quite
otherwise then is done in Europe. For, instead of infusing it into warm water, they beat
it as small as powder, and take of it as much as will lye on the point of a Knife, and put it
into a dish of Porcelane or Earth, full of seething Water, in which they stir it, till the Water
be all green, and then drink it as hot as they can endure it. It is excellent good after
a debauch, it being certain there is not any thing that allayes the Vapours, and settles the
Stomack better then this Herb doth. The Pots they make use of about this kind of
Drink are the most precious of any of their Houshold-Stuffe, in as much as it is known,
that there have been Tsia-pots, which had cost between six and seven thousand pound
sterling.
                  Their Marriages are sollicited only the Relations,Their Marriages. who have some superiority over those
that contract them. The Father and Mother find out the party, and propose that alliance???
and for want of them, others of the Kindred; so as that the young Couple know nothing

of what is done, in so much that the persons who are to be married never see one another
till the Marriage is to be consummated. This is the more easily effected, in that it is in the
Husbands power to keep what number he thinks fit of Concubines, nay, may prosecute his
enjoyments among common Prostitutes, whereas the least suspition of the Womans dishonesty
would cost her her life. They have also the convenience of Divorce, and may send
their Wives back to their own Friends, yet conceive it no disparagement to them. True
it is, that only Persons of mean condition use it, as Merchants, Tradesmen, and common
Souldiers; and that Persons of Quality take another course, out of a respect to the Birth
and Relations of the Woman; and in case of disagreement they still maintain them according
to their Quality. Which hinders not but that they also are most liberal of themselves
among their Concubines, little it seems troubled at the discontent they give their
Wives, whom they see but when they please themselves. For, certain it is, that the Women
only are married, and that the Men are as much at liberty after, as they had been before
marriage. Common Brothel-houses are allowed, and there are some Masters who buy
Slaves only to drive that trade; it being their perswasion, that to avoid a greater scandal,
this may be permitted.
                  They bring up their Children with extraordinary indulgence and mildness,Their education of their Children. never beating,
and very seldom chiding them; out of this consideration, that knowing they are not
come to the use of their reason, they conceive they are not to be made capable thereof before
the time, and that things are to be instill'd into them, according to their weak capacity,
with mildness, and that they ought to be instructed rather by good Examples then
many Precepts. It is to be imagined that the little correction they give them in their
Childhood, strengthens that obstinate disposition, which is remarkable in all the Iapponneses:
but it is to be confessed withall, that this noble and mild kind of education much
heightens that vivacity of Understanding and Judgment, which is discernable in them,
while they are yet very young; in so much that Children of seven, eight or nine years of
age, have more piercing Wits, and are more searching and inquisitive, then our youth is at
seventeen or eighteen years of age.
                  They are not sent to School till they are seven or eight years of age,Go not to School till seven or eight years of age. upon this account,
that, as they affirm, Children are not capable of instruction before that time, and that they
are apt to learn only naughtiness and unhappy tricks one of another. The Masters, when
they meet with dull Boys, never either chide or beat them for that, but teach them to read
and write by degrees, by raising an emulation in them to do as well as others; and by this
course they improve them much better, then if they treated them harshly, it being to be
observ'd, that it is an incorrigible Nation, expecting to be mildly treated, and seldom to be
bettered by soul means and blows.
                  They never swath the Children,Not swath'd. but as soon as they are brought into the World, the
Midwife having wash'd them in cold Water, thrusts them into the Sleeves of their Iaponneses,
and by that means they so harden them against heat and cold, that many times such as
scarce have the use of their legs, will crawl stark naked of all four about the House, and
into the Fields.
                  The eldest Son being come to Mans estate, the Father resigns his charge to him; or, if
he be a Merchant, makes over his Trade to him, with the better half of his Estate, assigns
him the best Lodgings in the House, and goes with the rest of the Family to another part
of it; or if he be a person of ability, he resigns the whole House to him, and takes another,
mannaging what he hath reserved of his Estate, for the advancement of his other
Sons, if so be he hath any. The Daughters have no part of the Fathers Estate, no not
even when they are married, in regard they would not have Wives to make any advantage
of their Dower; so that if the Brides Father should on the Wedding-day send a sum
of Money to the Bridegroom, he returns it back again with great Complements, and sends
word, that he would not have his Father-in-Law think, that his Addresses to his Daughter
proceeded from any other motive then the desire he had of his alliance, and consequently
that he expected not to make any advantage of his Estate.
                  They are so ambitious and highly conceited of themselves,The Japonneses tender in point of honour. that it is seldom seen a Iaponnese
does any thing wherewith he might be reproached: but on the contrary, they
would rather lose their lives then betray their honour. Of this I shall here insert an illustrious
Example.
                  In the time of the War between Fidery,An Example of it. and his Guardian, the King or Prince of Cocora,
who had discovered some inclination to the contrary party, was forc'd to leave his Wife
and Children as Hostages with Fidery, who hearing that the Prince of Cocora had openly
declar'd for his Adversary, sent word to his Wife, that his pleasure was, she should come
and live within the Palace. She would have excused her self, by representing to Fidery,

that she was a Wife, and as such, ow'd the Prince her Husband the same obedience, as her
Husband ow'd to the Emperour; so that if his Majesty expected she should do what he
would have her, his best course were to apply himself to her Husband, that he might command
her to do it. Fidery seeing her constancy, sent her word, that if she came not, he
would have her brought thither by force. But the Princess considering with her self, that
if she left her House, it would be a dishonour both to her and her Husband, withdrew her
self with her Nurse and Children, and some of the menial Servants, who proffer'd to dye
with her, to a Chamber, into which she caused Gun-powder and Wood to be brought, and
having made her Will, and writ a Letter to her Husband, she put both into the hands of a
trustly Person, with order to depart as soon as he had seen the Powder set on fire, and by
this means gave an extraordinary Demonstration of her constancy.
                  They are also very punctual in the performance of what they had promised those,Are good Friends. who
desire their assistance or protection. For no Iaponnese but will promise it any one that desires
it of him, and spend his life for the person who hath desired him to do it; and this,
without any consideration of his Family, or the misery whereto his Wife and Children may
be thereby reduced. Hence it comes, that it is never seen a Malefactor will betray or discover
his Complices; but on the contrary, there are infinite Examples of such as have chosen
rather to die with the greatest torment imaginable, then bring their Complices into any
inconvenience by their confession.
                  Iapan is so rich and abundant in all things,What Forraigners trade thither. that, some few Merchants excepted, who
trace into the Indies, there is hardly any Iaponnese, who meddles with the venting of
any forreign Commodities. The greatest Commerce which is carried on there is that of
the Chineses, who have continued theirs in this Country ever since the Island was first
peopled. The Spaniards and Portuguez have traded thither these six or seven score years;
and the English had no sooner begun, but they gave over their trading into those parts,
by reason of the small advantage made thereby. Those of Siam and Cambodia were
wont to send thither yearly two or three Ionques; but this is also given over, especially
since the Dutch bring them the Commodities of Iapan at a lower rate, and with less
danger then they could fetch them themselves. The chief Trade is at the City of Meaco,
whither most of the Merchants, as well forreigners as those of the Country, bring all
their Commodities, and where they have their Agents and Factors, to distribute them over
all the Island.
                  The Commodities which Forreigners bring to Iapan are,The occasion of the rupture between the Chineses and the Japonneses. about four or five thousand
Picols of Silk, and abundance of Stuffs, of Silk, Cotton, Thread, &c. above two hundred
thousand Deer skins, about a hundred thousand other Hides, Hemp, Linnen-clothes, Wooll,
Garments, Cotton, Quicksilver, all sorts of Gums and Medicinal Drugs, Spices, Cloves,
Pepper, Sugar, Musk, a sort of Wood called Sappan, and Calambac, Purcelan, Camphir,
Borax, 'Elephants Teeth, Coral, and all kind of Mercury, which the Chineses
bring.
                  The Chineses and Iaponneses have heretofore lived in very good correspondence, in so
much that there hardly passed a year, but the Kings of those two powerful States visited
one another by reciprocal Embassies. This friendship continued till the Iaponneses, who
lived in China, became so insolent, as to ransack a whole City, and to ravish all the Women
and Maids that fell into their hands. The Chineses resented the affront as they ought, and
killed all the Iaponneses they met withall. The King of China, considering of how dangerous
consequence it was to afford refuge to a sort of people, who had the insolence to commit
such an action in the time of peace, banished them his Kingdom for ever, ordering the
Decree to be graven in golden Letters upon a Pillar, which to that purpose he caused to be
erected upon the Sea-side, and forbidding his Subjects, upon pain of death, to trade into
Iapan. These Prohibitions are still so strictly observ'd, that the Chineses, who go thither,
give out, that they carry their Commodities to some of the neighbouring Islands of the
Indies; in regard they are sure they would be confiscated, if it were known they carried
them to Iapan; but the Iaponneses treat the Chineses otherwise, and give them the egress
and regress of their Country.
                  It is haply from these Prohibitions of the King of China,Japan was not peopled by Chineses. that some have taken occasion
to affirm, that Iapan was peopled by certain Exiles, whom the King of China had sent
thither, upon a Conspiracy they were engaged in against his person; since the Histories of
neither Iapan nor China speak of any such thing, and that otherwise there is so great a
difference in their Cloathing, their Ceremonies, manner of Life, Language and writing, that
it is impossible that the same Nation should have contracted, even in the sequel of many
Ages, such contrary Habits. Some affirm, that the Iaponneses have made this change, in
revenge for the ill treatment they received of the others; but besides the unlikelihood

there is, that a whole Nation should, of a sudden, conceive an aversion for what they lov'd
before, there is yet a greater improbability, that it should so change its language and manner
of writing, as that there should be no rapport between the one and the other. The
Chineses never cut their Hair, but tie it up together upon the Crown of the Head; the Iaponneses,
on the contrary, shave the fore-part of the Head down to the Ears, and tie up the
rest of their Hair in their Neck behind, with a String made of Paper. The latter do also
shave their Beards, whereas the Chineses suffer theirs to grow to their full length: whence
it may be imagined, that they were rather Tartars, who first got into this Island, then
Chineses.
                  The Iaponneses, being thus banished China, began to establish their Commerce at Tayouan,
in the Island Fermosa, whither the Chineses came with their Commodities; but the
King of China hearing of it, forbad his Subjects o trade thither, by which means the Iaponneses
were frustrated of that Navigation. Wich so troubled the Emperour, that he
would not permit his Subjects to trade out of the Kingdom without his express
Commission and Pasports; as well out of this consideration, that he would not have
any Arms transported out of the Country, as the experience he hath that the Iaponneses
are a stout and daring People out of their own Country, and being extreamly conceited of
himself, he would not have any affront done them, which it should not be in his power to
resent, or that any other then himself should chastise their insolence, as it happened to them,
not long since in the Kingdom of Siam, upon their Attempt against the Kings person
there, and at Nayouan, upon their assaulting the Governour of the place.
                  There is no Custom or Duty paid upon any Commodities in Iapan,No Custom paid in Japan. either to the Emperour,
or any other Prince or Lord, so that the whole advantage comes in to the Merchant;
but in regard all drive some Trade or other, and that the Countrey is extreamly
populous, the profits are very small.
                  Since the Rupture between the Chineses and Iaponneses, the Emperour of Iapan hath
not held any correspondence with any forreign Prince.No correspondence between the Emperour of Japan and other Princes. The King of Siam, the Pope,
and the King of Spain, sent very considerable Embassies to him, which were all very
kindly received by him; but the Emperour of Iapan never sent to visit or complement
them.
                  There is, all over Iapan, but one Language, which is so different from that of China,
Corea, and Tunking, that the Inhabitants of these four Countreys, understand one another
no more then we do the Arabick. There is also the same difference between their Characters,
and yet they have all four a sort of Characters, by which they understand one the
other, so that those among them, who have studied, understand and express in their particular
Language, what the others would have expressed in theirs, by means of these common
Characters. They write with Pencils, and that so fast, that they spend very little
time in writing the Notes, by which they do most of their Messages, rather then by word
of mouth. They endeavour to express themselves in few words, especially when they
either speak or write to Persons of great Quality; so that the Letters and Petitions they
address to their Superiours are couched in few words, that it is no great trouble to afford
them the reading.
                  They have not the way of keeping Accounts as the Merchants in our parts have;Their Arithmetick.
but they can count with certain little Bowls, which they thread upon little Sticks on a
square Board, as fast as our ablest Accountans by all the Rules of Arithmetick, even
that of Three.
                  They have many Books, and some great Libraries, but of these not so great a number as
we have in Europe.
                  The Dayro is the person who keeps Memorial of whatever passes,The Dayro writes the History of the Country. and writes the Chronicle
of the Country. It is also only he, and the Lords and Gentlemen of his House,
who are in number above eight hundred, as also the Lords and Ladies descended from
him, who have the priviledge to write any Books. These only have all the Learning among
themselves, and are so proud of it, that the advantages they make thereof are equal to those
they derive from their Birth, which is no doubt more noble then that of the Emperour.
Thence it comes that they sleight all others so far, that they shun their conversation, live
in a quarter of the City distinct from the rest, and will have no communication with the
ignorant.
                  There is but one kind of Measure all over the Country,The Money of Japan. and all the Money is at the same
rate and value. The Gold is in its excellency, but the Silver not so good, so that to reduce
it to the rate of that of France, there will be a loss of 22. or 23. in the 100. They
have three sorts of Gold Coins, whereof one weighs six Spanish Ryals, and is worth forty
eight Tayls, accounting every Tayl at about five Shilling Sterling. Ten of the second

kind weigh a Ryal and half a quarter, and are worth one Tayl, and a fifth part each of them:
and ten of the third sort weigh a Ryal and a half and half a quarter, and are worth, each
of them, the sixth part of Tayl. The Silver Coin, which is made in the form of a Lingot,
is of no certain weight; but it is so ordered, that as much of it as amounts to fifty
Tayls is to be of a just weight, which they dispose into Rolls of Paper, in each as much as
comes to twenty Crowns, and so they dispatch their Payments with little trouble. They
have besides this a lesser Coin of Silver, made much like French Beans, which also is not of
any certain weight, save only in gross, or when it amounts to such a sum, from the value of
seven pence to six shillings, or better. There is also a great difference in the value of the
Caxias; for of some of them, a thousand are worth but Crown, whereas of others the
same number may amount to three Crowns and a half. Much about the time of our Travels
the Emperour had ordered them to be caried down, intending to have a new Money
made of Brass, and that the poorer sort might not be ruined thereby, he caused the bad
Money to be called in, and made good the value of it to such as brought it in.
                  This Country wants not any kind of Cattel,Japan well stored with Cottel and Fowl. but is so much the more abundant therein,
out of this respect, that they do not geld any Creature. Thence it comes they are well
stor'd with Houses, Bulls, Kine, Swine, Deer, wild Boars, Bears, Dogs, &c. as also with
all sorts of Fowl, as Swans, Geese, Ducks, Herns, Cranes, Eagles, Falcons, Pheasants,
Pidgeons, Woodcoocks, Quails, and all the other sorts of small Birds, that we have in these
parts.
                  There are also in this Country several sorts of Mineral Waters, very good against divers
Diseases. Some have the taste and qualities of Copper, others that of Saltpeter, Iron,
Tin, Salt; and there is, among others, a Source of hot water which hath the taste of Tin,
and issues out of a Caye, which is about ten foot diameter at the mouth, and hath both
above and below several picked Stones, like Elephants teeth, so that it somewhat resembles
that figure, by which some would represent the Jaws of Hell. The Water, which
comes out of it in great bubbles day and night constantly, is not so hot, but that it may be
endured as soon as it is out of the Source, so that there is no need of mixing any other
water therewith.
                  There is in this Country, in a spacious Plain, at the foot of a Mountain, not far from the
Sea-side, another Source, which gives Water but twice in four and twenty hours, and that
during the space of an hour at each time, unless it be when the East-wind blows, for then
it gives water four times a day. This water comes out of a hole, which Nature hath
made in the ground, and which they have cover'd with several great Stones; but when
the time of its floud, as I may call it, is come, the water is forced out with such violence
amidst the Stones, that it shakes them all, and makes a cast twenty or twenty four foot high,
with such noise as would drown that of a great Gun. It is so hot, that it is impossible fire
should raise ordinary water to so high a degree of heat, as the earth gives this; for it immediately
burns the stuffes on which it falls, and keeps its heat much longer, then the water
that hath been boil'd over the fire. The Well is inclosed with a high Wall, having at
the bottom thereof several holes, through which the water runs into certain Channels, and
so is brought into the houses, where they bath themselves, reducing it to such a degree of
warmth as may be endured.
                  Some affirm that their Physicians are so able,Their Physicians. that there is no Disease which they cannot
discover by the Pulse. They are perfectly well skill'd in the vertues of Simples and Drugs,
especially those of the Radix Chinat, and Rhubarbe, whereof they make use in their Recipe's,
which for the most part consist in Pills, with very good success. They are also very
fortunate in the curing of ordinary Diseases; but Chirurgery is not as yet known among
them.
                  The Mineral Waters we spoke of before,The riches of Japan. are a sufficient demonstration, that there are in
Iapan Mines of all sorts of Metals. Accordingly, there is found Gold, Silver, Copper,
Tin, Iron and Lead. The Country brings forth also Cotton, Flax and Hemp, wherewith
they make very fine Cloaths. It produces also Silk, and affords abundance of Goat and
Deer skins, the richest Works of Wood and Lacque of any in the World, all sorts of Provisions
and medicinal Drugs. They have, among others, a particular Invention for the
melting of Iron,A particular way of meltig Iron. without the using of any fire, casting it into a Tun done about on the inside
with about half a foot of Earth, where they keep it with continual blowing, and take
it out by Ladles full, to give it what form they please, much better, and more artificially
then the Inhabitants of Liege are able to do. So that it may be said, Iapan may live without
its Neighbours, as being well furnish'd with all things requisite to life.
                  The Portuguez came to the knowledge of Iapan, by means of the Trade they drove in
the Kingdom of Siam and Cambodia. They found it no hard matter to settle themselves

there, in as much as the Iaponneses had not, at first, any aversion for their Ecclesiastical Ceremonies,The Roman Cathol Religion planted in Japan.
so that in a short time the Roman Catholick Religion got such footing there, that
they were permitted to build Churches in several places of the Kingdom, and particularly
at Nangasacky. But the Spaniards too soon discover'd the Design they had to establish
themselves there, and had not the reservedness to smother that haughty homour, which
would reign all over the World: which occasion'd the Iaponneses first to set upon, and
afterwards,The Spaniards baished it. to burn their Ships, in so much that in the year 1636. they banish'd them the
Country, with Prohibitions, upon pain of Death, not to return into it.
                  The Dutch have traded thither ever since the year 1611. and still continue it, so much
to their advantage,The Dutch established there. that their Commerce to Iapan is worth what they carry on all over the
rest of the Indies. They affirm in the Relation of the Voyage they made thither in the
year 1598. that the City of Meaco is one and twenty Leagues about, but that it had been
much ruined by the precedent Civil Wars. That Ossacks, and Boungo, are Cities, which,
for Wealth, may be compared to any other in the Indies. That the Emperours of Iapan
were ordinarily interr'd in the City of Coyo, of if they made choice of any other place for
their Sepulture, yet were some of their Bones carried thither, though it were but a Tooth.
That the City of Piongo, eighteen Leagues from Meaco, was in some part ruined during the
Civil Wars of Nobananga, who was defeated by Faxiba, the Predecessour of Taicko, and that
what remained of it was partly destroy'd by an Earthquake that happened in the year
1596. and partly by the fire which consumed the wretched remainders of it, some time
after. The Cities of Sacay, Voluquin, Founay, Tosam, and several others, are also very considerable
ones.
                  The Air is good and healthy,The Air of Japan. though more inclin'd to cold then heat, and yet the Iaponneses
sow their Corn at the beginning of May, but cut not the Rice till September.
                  They have neither Butter nor Oyl, and have an aversion against Milk, out of an imagination,
that the Souls of Beasts reside in it, and that it is bloud in effect, though of a different
colour. They do not eat the flesh of either Bulls or Kine, nor that of any tame beast,
but love wild Fowl and Venison, and are much addicted to the hunting thereof. They
have Cedar-trees, which are so big, that they make Pillars of them for their greatest Edisices,
and Masts for their Ships.
                  Poverty is not so criminal or infamous in Iapan,Have many good qualities. as it is in several places of Europe, where
the rich are only accounted vertuous. They hate Calumniators, Swearers and Gamesters;
but they have also their Vices, which much eclipse their other good parts.
                  They are rather of a brownish Complexion then white, strong and well set, enduring
paints taking, and the inconveniences of the Seasons, with incredible patience. They endure
hunger and thirst, heat and cold, without any trouble, and are no otherwise clad in
Winter then they are in Summer.
                  The Iaponneses are distinguished into five Orders.Are distinguished into five Orders. The first, is that of Kings and Princes,
and such as have civil or military Charges and Employments, who are all called by a common
name Tones. The second is that of Ecclesiasticks, whom they call by a general name
Bowzes. The third is that of Gentlemen and Merchants. The fourth that of Tradesmen,
and such as relate to the Sea. And the fifth that of Labourers, and such as work by
the day.
                  The general administration of Affairs is in the hands of three principal Ministers of
State; the first whereof,The principal Ministers of Japan. superintendency is over Ecclesiastical affairs, hath the quality
of Zazo; he who hath the disposal of Charges and Offices is called Veo, and he who
hath the oversight of things relating to the War is called Cabacama.
                  There could not be hitherto had any true account of the Emperour of Iapan's Revenue:
but it is certain that he makes above two Millions of Gold of the Rice, which his
own Demesne affords him every year. It is also certain, that the Emperour of Iapan is so
powerful,
that Taicko, whom we spoke of before, finding himself well settled upon the
Throne, had a design to pass over into China, with a Fleet of two thousand Vessels, for the
building whereof he had already cut down Timber, which he might have done with the
more ease, upon this account, that the Iaponneses are incomparably a more warlike Nation
then the Chineses.
                  But in regard there is not any thing makes a greater descovery of the greatness of this
Monarch,
then the Ceremonies of the Interview between him and the Dayro, whereof we
promised before to give here a short description, we think fit to that purpose to insert in
this place the Extract of a Relation made by the Director of the Dutch Commerce in
Iapan, who was at Meaco in the year 1626. This Author sayes, that being at the Emperours
Court in the moneth of October, in the year aforesaid, with some others of the Deputies
of his Nation, he was desirous to see the Procession, which was made there on the

25. of the said moneth. To that end they went the 24. and with the retinue took up a
house, which they had hired near the Dayro's Palace, in regard the next day it would have
been impossible for them to pass the Streets.
                  On the said 25. of October,The Procession of the Dayro and Emperour. as soon as it was light, they found the Streets and tops of
Houses full of people. The Streets were rail'd in on both sides, from the Dayro's Palace
to the Emperours, having files of Souldiers all along, and the middle of the Street strew'd
with white Sand, all laid so even, that nothing should retard the Procession, or disturb its
Order. These Souldiers, who were part of the Dayro's Guards, part of the Emperours,
were all clad in white, having on their Heads Casks of black Lacque, by their sides two
Cymitars, and in their Hands a Nauganet, that is, a Iaponnese Pike.
                  The first appearance was that of a great number of the Domesticks of these two Princes,The Dayro's baggage.
going to and fro, as also that of several Porters or Sedan-men, who carried in great
square Chests, which were of black Lacque and gilt, the baggage of the Dayro to the Emperours
Palace.
                  Then followed,The Ladies of Honour. in forty six Palanquins, carried each of them by four men, so many Maids
of Honour belonging to the Dayro's Wives, who went in that equipage to the Emperours
Palace. The Palanquins were of a fine white Wood, painted with Verdure, garnished
with brass Plates, very neatly made, and five or six foot high.
                  After them there came one and twenty other Palanquines of a kind, which they call
Norrimones, varnish'd with black and gilt.
                  Next them there came twenty seven other Norrimones,27. Lords of the Dayro's Retinue. of the same bigness with the
precedent, but made with Wickets and Windows, for so many Lords of the Dayro's Retinue,
who were carried in them to the Emperours Palace, having every one before him a gilt
Umbrello, covered with very fine Cloth. They had about them a hundred and eight Pages
clad in white,24. Gentlemen. and behind them four and twenty Gentlemen, armed as if they were ready
to engage in a fight. These had on their Heads a kind of Bonnets of black Lacque,
with a little Plume of Feathers of the same colour, and under their Iaponnesses they had
long and narrow Breeches of Satin, of several colours, embroidered with Gold and Silver,
with Buskins varnished with black, and gilt at the extremities. By their Sides they had
Cimitars, the Hilts whereof were gilt, and Bows and Arrows at their Waste, and over their
Shoulders Scarfs richly embroidered, the ends whereof hung down on the Cruppers of
their Horses. No doubt, they had cull'd out the goodliest persons in the Country of this
Ceremony; for they were all the handsomest persons, both as to Body and Countenance,
that could be seen. Their Saddles were varnish'd over and gilt, the Seats embroidered
and covered with Tigers and Lynxes Skins; their Trappings were of Crimson Silk twined,
and the Horses had their Mains tied up with Gold and Silver Thread, and they had on the
Breast and Crupper a kind of Net-work of twined crimson Silk, and instead of Shooes
their Hoofs were done about with plain crimson Silk. Every Horse was led by two Lacquies,
and two other Lacquies carried two great Umbrelloes, covered with a very fine and
transparent cloth, and upon that a covering of Scarlet fring'd with Gold. Another Lacquie
carried a Nanganet, or Pike, the top whereof was also covered with a piece of red and
black cloth. Every Horsman had eight Pages clad in white, and arm'd with two Cymitars,
according to the mode of the Country.
                  This body of Horse serv'd for a Guard for the three chiefest of the Dayro's Wives,The Dayro's three Wives. who
followed it in three Coaches of so extraordinary a making, that we shall not think it much
to afford them a short description. They were at least twenty or twenty five foot in height,
ten or twelve in length, and five or six in breadth, having on each side three, and before,
two Windows with embroydered Curtains. Before and behind they were made like the
Front of a House, as was also the Door at which they went in, which was made behind at
the back. The Wheels were of Iron, and the Coach was varnished all over with black,
so that the Wheels might be seen turning as it were in a Looking-glass. The Roofs of
them, which were built Arch-wise, had drawn thereon the Dayro's Arms, within a great
Circle of Gold. The Pillars, as also the inside of the Coach, was inriched with Figures of
beaten Gold and Mother of Pearl, and all the extremities were garnished with Gold. Two
great black Bufflers, covered with a Net-work of Crimson Silk, drew each of them, and
they were guided by four Halberteers clad in white. Every Coach was valued at seventy
thousand Tayls, which amount to twenty thousand pounds Sterling.
                  These Coaches had also their Foot-guard, and many Pages marching on both sides of
them.
                  Twenty three of the chiefest Servants belonging to these Ladies were carried next to
them in so many black Norrimones,The chief Servants of those Ladies. adorned with Brass plate, having each of them marching
before him a Halbertier, who carried an Umbrello, on each side two Pages, and behind

them sixty eight Gentlement of the Dayro's, clad and armed as those we mentioned before.68. Gentlemen.
These march'd two a breast, and were followed by a great number of Pages, Halberteers,
and Slaves.
                  After them there were carried. 
                        Two gilt Stools, with Plates of Gold at the extremities.
                        A great Fire-work.
                        A great and very rich Sea-Compass.
                        Two great Golden Candlesticks.
                        Two Pillars of Ebony.
                        Three Cabinets of Ebony, garnished with Gold plates.
                        Four other Cabinets, bigger and richer then the three precedent.
                        Two great Gold Basins carv'd.
                        A pair of Pantofles varnish'd.
                     
                  
                  After these,The Emperour and his Word. there followed in two Coaches of the same making as the three first, the
Emperour and his Ward, having before them a hundred and sixty Gentlemen, armed with
two Cymitars and a Nanganet, serving for a particular Guard about their Majesties persons.
These Guards they call Sambreys, and they are chosen out of the most valiant and most
active persons in the Kingdom. Immediately before the Coaches there march'd four
Men with Umbrelloes, four others with great Iron Rods to make way, two light Horses
magnificently cover'd, and with very rich Trappings, accompanied each of them by eight
Men, arm'd with Bows and Arrows, and two great Pikes.
                  The Emperours Brethren followed next on Horse-back, accompanied by all the Princes
and Lords of Iapan, who were also on Horse-back??? all armed, and sumptuously clad, 164.
in number.
                  The Chiefest of these Lords were, The greatest Lords of Japan.
                     
                        Owaruy Camny Samma, the Emperours Brother.
                        Quiney Deymangon samma, another Brother of the Emperour.
                        Mittot Chonango samma, a third Brother of the Emperour.
                        Massummenamoet Nocammi samma, a fourth Brother of the Emperours.
                        Matsendairo Thoy quese Nocammi samma, Lord of Canga.
                        Matsendairo Moutsnocammy samma, Satsumadonne, that is, Lord of Satsuma.
                        Matsendairo Iondonne.
                        Mansendairo Symouts quedonne.
                        Matsendairo Quonenoch, Wacchoo; and
                        Turogan Deynangono Cammy samma.
                     
                  
                  These march'd all in a File, having each of them a long train of Pages, Lacqueys, Halerteers,
Guards and Slaves.
                  The other Lords, among whom were Ouwaydonne; and Woutadonne, the ehiefest of the
Emperous Councel, march'd two a breast, he of the greater quality taking the left hand,
which among them is accounted the more honourable.
                  After them march'd four hundred of the Guards of the body, and in the same order, in
white Liveries.
                  Next them,The Dayro's Concubines. in six fair Coaches, came the Dayro's Concubines; but these Coaches were
not so large as the former, and were drawn each of them by a single Buffer.
                  Then followed sixty eight Gentlemen on Horse-back, attended by a great number of
Lacqueys and Slaves.
                  The Dayro's Secretary,He Sacretary. accompaied by thirty seven Gentlemen on Horse-back, follow'd
next in a Coach, and immediately preceded forty six Lords of the Dayro's House,
who were carried in Norimonnes, whereof fifteen were of Ebony, beautified with Ivory,
thirteen varnished with black and gilt, and the other eighteen were only varnished
with black. There were carried after them fourty six Umbrelloes suitable to their Norimonnes.
                  Then followed the Dayro's Musick,His Musick. which consisted of fifty four Gentlemen, very odly,
but very richly clad, who plaid on their Instruments, which were only Tabours, Timbrels,
Copper Basins, Bells, and that kind of Lute we spoke of before, which was not heard by
reason of the confused noise of the rest.
                  
                     
Yet was this distracted kind of Musick delightful to the Dayro, who immediately followed
it.The Dayro He was sate in a little wooden Structure made like a Sedan, but much larger,
as being about seven or eight foot high, and as many Diameter, having windows on all
sides, with embroidered Curtains. The Roof of that little Structure was arch'd, and
had in the midst, upon a great Button, a Cock of massie Gold, with his Wings spread in a
Field Azure, with several Stars of beaten Gold about the Sun and Moon, which appeared
there with a lustre coming near the natural. This Machine was carried by fifty Gentlemen
of the Dayro's retinue, all clad in white, with Bonnets on their Heads. Fourty other Gentlemen
went before it, and represented the Guard for the Dayro's person. These were clad
after a particular fashion, much like that of the ancient Romans, carrying each of them a
gilt Nouganet. The Captain of the Guard marched alone on Horse-back, behind the Dayro's
Chair, armed with a Target, stuck through with several Arrows, and had carried after
him fourty Umbrelloes for the Guards.
                  Next were carried thirteen varnish'd Chests, and in the close of the Procession came
four hundred Souldiers clad in white, who marched six a breast, and by that means hinder
the crowds of people to interrupt that Order. This Ceremony took up the whole day,
so that night coming on upon us at the place where we were, we thought it not safe to
venture home at so unseasonable a time, by reason of the many Robberies, Murthers, and
other Violences committed in the Streets during the disorder, which proved so great, that
the next morning there were found a great number of dead persons, some whereof had
been kill'd and robb'd, and others had been smother'd in the throng. The Dayro staid
three dayes at the Emperours Palace, who during that time waited on him in person with
his Brethren, and had the charge of his Table, for that time defray'd by Sugadonne, chief
Judge of the City of Meaco, Ivocamosamma, Cobritot homy Samma, Macamora, Mockiemon
samma, and Mannosa Fryemon samma. There were brought to his Table at every meal,
a hundred and fourteen dishes of meat.
                  Ouwaydonne, the President of the Emperours Councel, Ivemondonne, one of the Counsellors
of State, Farimadonne, Quiniem Ondonne, Sioyserodonne, and Chirotadonne, provided
for the Table of the Dayro's three chiefest Wives.
                  The Emperours Present to him were. 
                        Two hundred Marks of Gold.
                        A hundred Garments of Watte, of the best.
                        Two great Silver Pots, full of Honey.
                        Five Catties of the Wood of Calambae.
                        Two hundred pieces of Crimson Serge.
                        Five Pots of Silver, full of Musk; and
                        Five excellent Horses with very rich Trappings.
                     The young Emperour gave him. 
                        Three thousand pieces of Silver amounting each to four Tayls and three Mases.
                        Two fair Cymitars set forth with Gold.
                        Two hundred rich Garments after the Iaponnese fashion.
                        Three hundred pieces of Satin.
                        A piece of Calamba-wood, three Ells and a half in length, and above two foot
thick.
                        Five great Vessels of Silver, full of Musk; and
                        Ten excellent Horses with rich Trappings.
                     
                  
                  These shall suffice for an account of the Kingdom and people of Iapan.
               
               
                  
                  The Island FERMOSA.
                  WE said elsewhere, that when the Iaponneses were banish'd China; there were
also Prohibitions made, that none should trade with them, and that the Chineses,
to avoid the confiscation of their goods, which they might carry to
Iapan, made choice of the Island of Tayovang, for the continuance of their
Commerce.The Iss of Tayovang This example encouraged the Dutch, in the year 1632. to make use of the
convenience of the same place, in regard the Chineses had depriv'd them of all hope of
Commerce with them, if they came not out of their Country, and setled not themselves
in a place where they might give no occasion of suspition.
                  There is not in all the East, a more convenient haven for the Trade of China, and for
the establishment of a Communication with Iapan, and all the rest of the Indies, then this
Island affords. For ships may come thither at all times of the year, so as that they need
not stay for the Moussons, or convenience of the general winds, which in all other places
last six moneths of the year.
                  About that time the Dutch built there a Fort,The Dutch settle there. with four Bastions, all of freestone, upon
a Down, or Sandy assent, within half a League of the great Island Fermosa. Within
three hundred paces of the Fort, there passes a Channel, which serves for a Haven, though,
even at high water, there be but thirteen or fourteen foot water; but the ships that Anchor
there may defie any wind. They have made a redoubt of Stone, very well flanck'd
upon the Channel, where they have a little Garrison of twenty five or thirty men, which
are enough to defend the entrance of it; and they have found the scituation of it so advantagious,
that they have given it the name of new Zealand.
                  The Island Fermosa,And  new Zealand, Fermosa. that is, the Fair Island, called by the Chineses Paccande, lies at 21.
Degrees on this side the line, within 32. Leagues of the River of Chineheu, and the Island
of Quemoy in China, reaching in length from South-west to North-east, as far as 21. Degrees
and a half.
                  It is about a hundred and thirty Leagues in compass,An Anarchy. and contains many Villages, and
an infinite number of men, who acknowledg no King nor Soveraign, and have no other
Superiours over them, then such as they create among themselves, after the manner we
shall give an account of hereafter. Its Rivers are excellently well stor'd with Fish; Its
Forrests well furnished with all sorts of wild-Fowls and Venison; and its Fields, which
are for the most part Meddows, in a manner covered with Cattel. They have Deere,
Wild-Goates, Hares, Conies, Pheasants, Partridges, Pidgeons, &c. and besides these a kind
of horned Horse, by the Inhabitants called Olavang, whose horns are like those of Deere,
and the flesh very delicate. They have also Tygers, and another kind of Animal, which
they call Tirney, made like a Bear, but much stronger. The skin of this Beast, they account
one of the most precious things that the Island produces.
                  The ground here is fat and fruitful, but so poorly cultivated, that there are very few
Fruit-trees, and the little Fruit that is, so bad, that though the Islanders eat it in some
delight, yet cannot other Nations so much as taste of it. There grows some Ginger and
Cinnamon in this Island, which they say hath Gold and Silver Mines, whereof the Chineses
have sometimes made trial; but it is more then the Dutch could ever discover.
                  The parts thereof which these last mentioned have most frequented are,The places possessed by the Dutch. Sinkan, Mandanw,
Toulang, Taffacang, Tifulucang, Teosang, Tefurang, which are all within a small distance
of the Fort Tayouang; so that they may be all gone to in two days, save only the
Village of Tefurang, which lies in the Mountains, at a day and a halfs journey at the least,
from the habitation of the Dutch. The rest lies as it were upon the Sea-side, and have
all the same manner of life, the same Religion, and almost the same Language.
                  A man would take the Inhabitants at the first sight,The Inhabitants of Fermosa. to be Barbarians, and Savages.
For the men are strong and hardy, much bigger then any of the Europeans, and coming
somwhat near the stature of the Gyants. Their bodies are hairy all over, and they are
of a brown complexion, inclining to black, as most of the Indians are. The women are
somewhat less, but fat enough, and, for the most part, well shaped. They make a greater
discovery of shamefacedness then the men, in that they have somewhat of cloathing about
them: but both men and women strip themselves, when they bath, which they do twice
a day, in warm water??? for then, the latter are not ashamed to be seen by men, nor care
much whether they have ought about them.
                  
                     
This People, which in appearance seems to be so barbarous, is in effect, good natur'd,
faithful and obliging,Are civil and good natured. entertaining strangers with much kindness and civillity, and communicating
to them such good chear as nature affords them. It hath never been found
that they were desirous to get what belongs to any other by indirect ways, but on the
contrary, they have often returned to the owners what they found mis-laid or lost; though
the Inhabitants of the Village of Toulang have a very ill report, as to this particular.
They are constant and faithful in their friendship, and religiously observe, as well the
Treatises they make among themselves, as those made with Forreigners. Treachery is a
thing they are so unacquainted withal,Are ingenious. that there is no misfortune which they would
not suffer rather then any reproach should be made them of unfaithfulness. They want
neither ingenuity nor memory, but easily apprehend and retain what is said unto them.
'Tis true, they have an humour of impudently begging any thing they see; but they are
denied with the same freedom, and are satisfied with a small matter.
                  They live altogether by the little Husbandry they carry on, and the Rice they get out
of the ground. Not but that their Lands are very fruitful, and that the Cantons we
named before might produce, what were able to sustain above ten thousand Families:
but in regard they have no Ploughs, nor Creatures fit for Tillage, they have no other way
of digging the ground, then that of the Spade, and that by the hands of Women; inasmuch
as the men mind only War and Hunting, and so their increase cannot be so great
as that of those places where they have better conveniences. Another employment of the
women is, to transplant the Rice, when it grows thicker in one place then another; which
work takes up much of their time, as does also their cutting of it when it is ripe. For instead
of reaping it by handfulls with a Hook, they cut it Corn by Corn, some four or five
fingers below the Ear, so put it up in the house, and never beat it but when there is
occasion, in order to their subsistance, that is, every day. The woman of the house sets
over-night two or three little bundles of it a-drying in the Chimney-corner, and rising the
next morning two hours before day, she beats it in a Morter, and makes as much clean Rice
as is requisite for the Family that day, and no more. And thus they live all the year
long.
                  They sow also two or three sort of Fruit,
                        
                      which they call Ptingh, Quach, and Taraun,
which are somewhat like Millet, as also a kind of Pulse much like the French Bean. They
 also several sorts of Roots, which they may use instead of Bread, and which in effect
 able to sustain them, though they had no Rice nor any other kind of Fruit or Corn.
They have Ginger, Cinamon, Sugar-canes, Bannanan's, Lemmons, abundance of Areea,
and several other sorts of Fruits, Simples, and Pulse, not known in Europe, such as it
would be no easie matter to describe.
                  Though they have no Cocos-wine,Their Wine. nor any other natural drink, yet have they found out
a way to make a kind of Beverage, which is as strong, and intoxicates a mans brains assoon
as the best Sack. Their way of ordering it is thus. They set a soaking in warm water
a certain quantity of Rice, which they afterwards beat in a Morter till it be reduced to a
Paste. Then they chew some Rice-meal in their mouths, which they spet into a Pot, till
such time as they have got a Quart of Liquor, which they put to the Pase instead of Leaven,
and after they have kneaded all well together, till they have brought it to Dough,
such as that of the Bakers, they put it into a great Earthen Pot, which they fill up with
water, and so let it remain there for two months; and by this means they make one of
the best and most pleasant Liquors that a man need drink. This is their Wine, which is
stronger or weaker according to the time it remains in the Pot; and the older it is, the
better and sweeter it is; insomuch that sometimes they keep it five and twenty or thirty
years. VVhat is towards the mouth of the Pot is as clear as Rock-water, but at he bottom
there are only dregs, such as were able to turn a weak stomack; and yet the Islanders
make it one of their delicacies, and eat it with Spoons, having first stirr'd at about, with
a little water put to it. When they go into the Countrey, they carry along with them a
Pot of this stuff, and a Gourd-bottle full of water, and so they are furnish'd as to 
and drink. They make use of the upper part of this Beverage, as of Aqua-viae, to comfort
the heart, and they eat what's in the bottom, ordered as we said before; whence it
comes that they spend most part of their Rice in this composition.
                  When the women have no work to do about their Grounds,Their women go afishing. and
particularly to get Oysters, which the Islanders prefer before all meat whatsoever.
They have a way of salting the Fish slightly assoon as it is taken, with the shell, and
whatsoever is within it, and they eat them with all the filth, nay with the worms, which
sometimes are bred within them for want of Salt.
                  The men,How the . especially the younger sort, to the age of twenty four or twenty five years,

do nothing at all: but when they are come to forty, they help to do somewhat about the
grounds, where they continue night and day with their Wives, in little Huts, and return
not to the Village till some necessity or divertisement calls them thither.
                  They have several kinds of Hunting,Their huntg. and use, in their sport, Snares, slender Pikes, or
Bows and Arrows. They spread their Snares or Nets in the Woods, cross those Paths,
which the Deers and wild Boars are wont to make, and force those Creatures into them:
or haply, they spread them in the open fields, with the convenience of a great Cane, one
end whereof they plant in the ground, and the other is bowed down, and fastened to certain
little sticks, upon which they lay a Suare cover'd with a little earth, which assoon as
the wild Beast touches, the Carie is suddenly as it were unbent, and hath him by one of
the feet. The Hunting with that kind of Pikes is thus. There met together, at a certain
place appointed, the Inhabitants of two or three Villages, arm'd every one with two
or three Pikes, and having divided themselves into several parties, they send their Dogs
into the Woods, and they force out the Game into the Fields, where they meet, and make
a great Ring, a League or more in compass, within which when they have once gotten the
Deer and wild Boars, it seldom happens that any of them escape without being kill'd or
hurt. The Pike it self is of Cane, six or seven foot in length, having an Iron at the top
with several Hooks, so as that being entred into the beast, it is beyond any mans strength
to get it out: but the Iron is not made so fast to the Wood but that it comes off at the
first bush the beast runs into; and to the end it may still annoy the Deer, there is a Cord
fastened thereto, which holds both, and at the top of the Iron there is a little Bell, whereby
the Beast is discover'd where-ever it goes. They destroy so great a number of Deer
by these kinds of Hunting, that being not able to spend all they take themselves, they
sell the flesh of them to the Chineses, for little Garments, Sweet Wood, and other Commodities,
eating themselves only the Umbles and Paunch, which they salt with the filth
in them, and indeed care not much for them, till when they are thus corrupted. Sometimes
while they are hunting, they cut off a piece, and eat it immediately, so as that the
bloud runs about their mouths; and if they find any young ones in the belly of the Female,
whether come into any form or not, they eat them with the skin and hair, as a
thing very delicate.
                  Their Military engagements are as followeth.The manner of their 
                      They begin not any War till they have
first declared it against the Village by which they conceive themselves injured, and then
they go by small parties of five and twenty or thirty men, and hide themselves near the
place they are to assault, till it be night, and then they run about the Fields, and if they
find any in the Huts, where aged persons are wont to keep, as we said before they kill
them, cut off their heads, and, if they have time enough, the hands and feet, and sometimes
they cut the whole body to pieces, that every one may carry away his share, and
shew the marks of his courage at his return. If the Country take the Alarm, so as they
cannot quite cut off the Head, they think it enough to cut off the hair, which they carry
away as a noble Demonstration of their Victory; which is accounted among them a
very considerable one, though that in an exploit of this nature there happens to be but
one man kill'd. Sometimes they venture so far as to enter into the Village, and break
open some house; but in regard that cannot be done without noise, they go upon such a
Design with so much precipitation, that lest they should be intercepted in their return,
they kill all they meet, and fly for it. They also use stratagems, and make Ambushes according
to their way, and sometimes they engage in the open field, where they fight with
great animosity: but the death of one man passes among them for an absolute Defeat, and
obliges those who have had that loss, to an immediate Retreat.
                  The Pikes they use in the Wars are made of a different manner from those they hunt
withall:
                        
                      for the Iron at the top hath no Branches nor Hooks, and is made fast enough to
the body of the Pike. Their Bucklers are so large, that they almost cover all the whole
body, and their Swords on the contrary, are short, but broad. They use also Knives
made like those of the Iaponneses, Bows and Arrows.
                  When several Villages make an Association among themselves to carry on a War jointly
against some other Villages, the Command of their Forces is not bestow'd on one Chief, who
hath Authority sufficient to force himself to be obey'd: but such among them as have been
so fortunate as to cut off divers heads upon several occasions, find Volunteers enough to
follow them in their military Exploits, out of no other Consideration, then that of participating
of the Glory of their Commander. Sometimes they engage in a War out of
a pure frolick, against the Inhabitants of the Island of Tugin, which the Dutch call
the Island of the Golden Lyon,The Island of Tugin. upon this account, that the Captain and Master of
a Ship, of that name, were there killed by the Islanders. The Inhabitants of

this place permit not any strangers to come within their Island; nay they suffer not the
Chineses, who come thither every year upon the account of their Commerce, to set foot on
Land; but they force them to stay in the Road, whither the Islanders bring the Commodities
they would truck with them; with so much distrust on their side, that they never
let go any thing out of one hand, till they have fast hold of what they would have in the
other. The Inhabitants of Fermosa, especially those of the Village of Soulang, having a
Design to surprize them, embarqu'd themselves not long since, to the number of sixty, disguiz'd
like China Merchants, and being come near the Island of Tugin, sent to some of the
Islanders to come and meet them with the Commodities of the Countrey: but instead of
receiving them from his hands, who presented them therewith, they laid hold of his arm,
and drew him aboard their Vessel, where they cut him to pieces. This was a great Victory
to them; for they think it enough to bring away the Hair, or haply a Pike of the Enemies,
to make a solemn Triumph, and appoint a day of publick Thanksgiving. They carry the
Heads in Procession all about the Village, singing Hymns to their Gods, and, in their way,
visit their Friends, who make them drink of the best Arac, and accompany them to the
Pagode, where they boil the Head, till there be nothing left but the Bones, on which they
sprinkle some Wine, Sacrifice several Swine to their Gods, and feast it for fifteen days together.
They do the like when they have brought home only the Hair, or a Pike, which,
as also the Bones of their Enemies, they keep a 
                     fully as we do Gold, Silver, or Jewels,
inasmuch as when a House is a-fire, they abandon all, to save their Relicks. They tender
so great respect to those who have had the good fortune to bring home an Enemies Head,
that no person comes near him, but with a certain veneration, for above fifteen days after
his doing such an exploit, nor speak to him but with such extraordinay submissions, as
that a Soveraign Prince could not expect greater.
                  There is no Lord in all that Island,Their Magistracy. that hath a Superiority or advantage over the rest.
Their condition is equal, save that in every Village there is a kind of Senate, consisting of
twelve persons, which are changed every two years. The two years being expir'd, they
who are to quit their places pull of their Hair off their Eye brows, and on both sides of
their Heads, to shew that they have been Magistrates. The Senators are chosen out of
persons much about the same age, which is that of forty years: for though they have no
Almanack, and cannot count their years, yet do they remember well enough the course of
the Moon, and take particular notice of such as are born within the same Month, and
about the same Year.
                  Not that this Magistrate hath any Authority to force himself to be obey'd,Its Authority. or to put his
Commands in execution; for all the power they have, is only to give order for an Assembly
to be held, concerning such Affairs as they think of importance, to confer among themselves
thereof, and to invite all the Heads of Families, to meet in one of their Pagodes,
where they propose to them how things stand, discover what they think fit to be done,
and endeavour to bring the rest to be of the same judgment with them. All the Senatours
speak one after another, and use all the Eloquence they have to press their Reasons the
more home: I say, Eloquence, for they really have of it. For they will speak half an
hour together in such high expressions, with so much ease, and with such apt gestures, that
what we are taught by Art comes not near what Nature hath bestow'd on these People, who
can neither write nor read. While one speaks, all the rest are so exactly silent, that you shall
not hear so much as a Cough, though their Assemblies many times consist of a thousand
persons. When all the Senators have done speaking, the rest put the business to deliberation,
with an absolute freedom of either complying with the judgment of the Senate, or opposing
it, after they have considered the good or evil which may accrew to them thereby.
                  All the power they have consists in causing what their Priestesses command to be put in execution,Their punishments.
in preventing ought to be done which may offend the Gods, and in punishing such as
do offend them. They also give reparations to private persons who have been injur'd by others:
not by causing the offenders to be imprison'd or punish'd with death, or other corporal
punishment; but in condemning them to pay a piece of cloth, a Deerskin, a certain quantity of
Rice, or a pot of their Aracque, by way of satisfaction, according to the quality of the crime.
                  There is a certain season of the year, wherein they go stark naked, and say they do it out of
this consideration, that were it not for that, the Gods would not cause it to rain, and the
Rice would not grow: insomuch, that if during the said time, the Senators meet with
any one that hath ought about his waste, the cloth or whatsoever it be, is confiscated, and
he is adjudged to a penalty, which at most, is but two Deer-skins, or a certain quantity of
Rice amounting to the same value. Whence it comes, that it is one of the principal Functions
of the Senatours, to be during that time, morning and evening, about the
avenues of the Village, and to punish such as they find Delinquent. There

are other seasons wherein they are permitted to cover that part of the body, (which is never
uncovered in other places,) but with this restriction; that the garment, or rather
skarf, wherewith it is covered, must not be of Silk; whence it also comes, that the same Senatours
are to take particular notice of it, confiscate those Silk Garments, and adjudge
the offendours to pay a penalty; as they do also the women, who to make the greatest
ostentation, upon days of publick Ceremonies, go otherwise then they are permitted to do.
                  The Senatours on the otherside, are obliged to observe a certain manner of life, about the
time that the Rice grows ripe; for during that time, they are forbidden drinking to excess,
the eating of sugar and fat, and chewing of Areca; out of a perswasion that the people
would not only slight them, but also that the gods would send the Deer and wild
Boars into the Rice, to destroy it.
                  The Magistrate hath no power to punish murther,The Magistrate hath no power. theft, or adultery; but such as are
injured do themselves Justice. When the theft is discovered, he who hath been robb'd,
goes accompanied by his Friends, to find out the person who hath robb'd him, and takes
out of his house what he thinks sufficient to make him satisfaction, by an accommodation
he makes with the other; but if he finds any Opposition, he declares open hostility
against him, till such time as he hath made him satisfaction. He who finds himself injured
in his reputation, by Adultery committed with his Wife, revenges himself another way;
for he takes out of his house who hath had to do with his wife, two or three Piggs, as a
satisfaction for the injury he hath received. The Friends and Relations on both sides compose
the differences arising between private persons, in the case of murther, and so regulate
the civil concernment.
                  There is among them so great an equality of condition, that they are yet ignorant of the
names of Master and Servant. Yet does not this hinder, but that they render great honour
one to another,They have a respect for old Age. and express a great respect and submission one towards another: not out
of any consideration of a more eminent dignity, or upon the accompt of wealth, but only
upon that of Age; which is so considered among them, that a young man is obliged to go
aside, to make way for an old man, and turn his back to him, by way of respect, till he
be passed, by continuing in that posture, even though the old man should stand still to speak
to him. No young man dares deny the doing of what the other commands him, though
he should send him three or four Leagues upon some business of his. They are the ancient
men who have the chiefest places, and are the first served at Feasts.
                  As to their Marriages;The Age of the men in order to marriage. the men are not permitted to marry till they be twenty or twenty
one years of age, which they call Saat Cassiu wang. Till they are sixteen or seventeen
they are forbidden to wear long hair, so that they cut it even with the tip of the Ear;
and in regard they have neither Cisers nor Rasors, to do that work, they make use of a
Parring, which is a kind of little chopping-knife, lay down the hair upon a piece of wood,
and cut it as exactly as the most expert Barbers among us. They draw forth the hair of
their faces with little Pincers of Brass or Iron, or with the string of a great Cane which
they double, and getting the hair fast between it, they turn the string till the hair be
taken out. Being come to the seventeenth year of their age, they let their hair grow,
and when it is come to its ordinary length, they begin to think of marriage. Maids never
cut their hair, and they are married assoon as they are marriageable.
                  Their marriages are contracted and continued after a pleasant manner.Their marriages The young
gallant who hath an inclination to a Maid, sends his Mother, Sister, or some Kinswoman
to the relations of the Maid, to shew them what he intends to bestow on his Mistress.
If they receive his addresses kirdly, and are satisfied as to his estate, the marriage is immediately
concluded, insomuch that the young man may consummate it the night following.
The wealth which the most able among them send to their Brides, consists in seven
or eight of these skarfs of Silk or Cotton, wherewith the women cover themselves about
the waste, so many little wastcoats of the same stuffe, three or four hundred bracelets of
Canes, ten or twelve Rings of Latten, or Deers horn, which are so broad that they hide
half the Fingers, and so thick, that when the Ladies have them on, they are rather a trouble,
then any ornament to them; four or five Girdles of course Cloth, ten or twelve little Vestments,
which they call Ethgrao, and are made of Dogs-hair, twenty or twenty five Cangas
or China garments, a bag of Dogs-hair as big as a man can well carry, which they call
in their Language Ayammamiang, a kind of head-gear, made like a Mitre, of straw and
Dogs-hair; and lastly, in four or five pair of stockins of Deer-skin; so that all put together
may amount to about forty Crowns at most. Others who are not so rich, give only three
or four Bracelets, and certain Garments, all not amounting to above two or three Crowns.
                  The marriage being thus concluded,A pleasant married life. the young Gallant goes in the Evening to his Bride
at her Fathers house, and endeavours to get in by stealth, shunning both fire and light,

lest he should be seen, and so creeps into the bed, where the marriage is to be consummated.
This he does for many years after his marriage, coming thence before day, and returning
at night to his Wife??? who still continues at her Fathers house, concealing himself so from
those of the houshold, that to call to his Wife for Tobacco or ought else he stands in need
of, he only hems, and permits her to return to the company she was in before, as soon as
she hath done what he desired. Of this carriage the reason is, that it were a shame for her
to leave her Relations, to go to her Husband. Their bed-steads are made of Bambus or
Canes; a baven serves them for a bolster, and a Dear-skin for bed and all belonging threeto.
                  The women living thus with their Fathers, till the ground belonging to the Family,
while the Husband lives at his own house, and provides only for himself. They never see
one another in the day time, unless they appoint it to be in some remote place, where
they may not be seen speaking together; or unless the young man goes to the house, when
he knows there is none but his Wife at home; yet will he not enter, till he hath sent one
to know, whether it may be done without any inconvenience to her. If she think fit he
should see her, she comes to the door, and makes him a sign to enter; but if she desires
not his company, she sends him away. The children they have remain with the Mother
till they are thirteen years of age,The Women bear no children till 35. years of Age. and then the Father takes them home. The Women
bear no children till they are thirty-five or thirty six years of Age, but destroy in the
womb such as they conceive before that time. To procure abortion, they have one of their
Priestesses comes to them, who kneeling upon their bellies causes miscarriage, insomuch
that the Fruit of the Womb, is forc'd out before they leave kneeding of them in that manner,
with greater pain to the Woman, then if she were naturally delivered. Not that
they are wanting in point of kindness to their Children, but prepossessed and befotted with
the lewd impression they receive from their Priestesses, that it were a great sin and shame
for them to bear Children before that Age.
                  The men live not with their Wives till they are forty years of Age. Then they take
their leave of the Pagodes of their quarter, forsake their own houses, and go and live in
the VVives; but being come to that Age, they spend most of their time in the Fields,
retireing in the night time into Huts, that they may be near their work.
                  Notwithstanding this liberty,Divorce lawful among them. which the men have to see their wives when they please
themselves, and to divert themselves elsewhere all day long, yet would they have also the
conveniency of Divorce. Assoon as a man is weary of his wife, he leaves her, and marries
another; but with this difference, that if he puts her away without cause, the presents
he sent her shall remain hers; but if she be convicted of Adultery, or chance to be
so transported with passion, as to revile her husband in words, or affront him otherwise,
she is bound to make restitution. Divorce is reciprocally free to both parties, so that
Wedlock no more obliges the woman then it does the men; and it often happens that
both of them change their conditions. They condemn Polygamy, though some of them
marry two or three wives. But in regard there is neither Law nor Magistrate to punish any
Crime wherein there is no Civil concernment, this remains unpunished, as well as Adultery;
for, provided they conceal it from their own Wives, and her Husband whom they
abuse, they may confidently, and without any scandal seek their fortunes elsewhere. A
man never finds any incestuous marriages among them, nor that a man takes a wife within
the fourth degree of Consanguity or Affinity. Nor do they care a man should aske after
their Wives, as how they do, whether they be handsome or not, of what friends they
come, &c.
                  Boyes, from four years of Age and upwards, nay married men, when they do not lodge
with their Wives, lye not at their own houses, but in a Pagode or Mosquite, where the
Males of fourteen or fifteen Families meet in the Evening, and lye there, upon little Couches
or Bedsteds of Canes, made as we described before.
                  Their houses are spacious,Their houses and fairer then such as are ordinarily seen in the Indies.
They are all raised five or six foot from the Ground, and have four doors, one towards
every quarter of the Heavens. There are some have two of a side, and are three or
four stories high. They have no other ornament then what they derive from the heads
of Deer and wild-Boars, wherein they are covered both within and without. You find
in them only certain stuffs, wherewith they cover themselves, and Deer-skins, which in
their trade with the Chineses, is to them instead of mony. All the houshold-stuff they have
in their houses are only Spades to digg the ground withall, Pikes, Bows, Arrows, and some
other Arms. But what they account most precious, are the heads or other Trophies taken
from their Enemies??? Instead of dishes, they use little troughs of wood, such as among
us are set before Swine. Their drinking-pots are of Earth or Cane, and they also boil
their Rice in Earthen-pots.
                  
                     
Rice is their ordinary sustenance; and if they put thereto either fish, or flesh, they eat not
of it, till it be corrupted and full of worms.Their sustenance. Their drink is not ill, especially to such as
have not over-weak stomacks, or know not how it is made; but on the contrary it is
wholsome and very pleasant.
                  They have no set day for either rest or devotion,Have no Festivals. and celebrate no Festivals, yet do they
meet on certain days to be merry, and make good chear; every quarter meeting, to that
purpose, in its own Pagode, whither the women also come, dress'd in the richest things
they have, and clad after??? such a manner as we cannot well describe, our Language not
having terms to express the odness of their habit. Their richest cloathing is made of
Dogs-hair.Dogshair-stuffs. For as we shear Sheep to make woollen stuffs of; so they have Dogs, whose
hair they cut once a year, and dying it red, make stuffs thereof, which they esteem, as we
hear do Velvet, or the best Scarlet.
                  The Ceremonies performed here upon the death of any one are haply as remarkable as
any the Reader shall find in this relation.Their Funerals. Immediately after the departure of any one,
they beat a Drum before his door to acquaint the Village therewith. This Drum is
made of the Trunk of a great tree, so that it may be heard at a great distance, and upon
that noise all the people come to the door of the deceased. The women bring each of
them a pot of their Arac, and having sufficiently drunk to the memory of the Deceased,
they fall a dancing upon a great empty round Chest, so that their motion, which is not very
violent, makes a dull and doleful noise, suitable to the sorrow they would express.
There get upon the Chest, eight or ten women at a time, in two ranks, who turn their
backs one to another, and gently stirring their armes and feet, they go several times about
the Chest, till such time as being weary, they think fit to make way for others; and
this exercise lasts about two hours.They neither bury nor burn the dead. The next day, or two days after, they begin to think
of the body, not in order to burial, as we do, nor yet to burn it, as some of the fore-mentioned
Nations are wont to do; but to dry it. To do that, they make in some part of the
house, a Scaffold of Canes, raised five or six foot from the ground, whereto they fasten the
body, by the hands and feet, and they make a great fire about it to dry it, killing in the
mean time a great many Swine, and feasting it for nine days together. During which
time they wash the body every day, yet does not that hinder, but that it infects the
whole house, nay indeed the Neighbourhood. After nine days, it is taken thence, to be
wrapt up in a Mat, being in which, they place it on another Scaffold, higher then the
former, and compassed with several garments like a Pavilion, and then they reiterate their
dancing and feasting. The body remains in the posture till the third year, and then they
take the bones out of it, and bury them in some part of the house, with the same Ceremonies
of feasting and dancing.
                  At the Village of Theosang,A mad ramedy against painful diseases. they have a custom, which would hardly be observ'd elsewhere.
They fasten a Rope about their necks who suffer much pain in their sickness, raise
them up by force to a great height, and let them fall down with as much violence, as if
they intended to give them the strapado: by which means they are indeed put out of all
further pain.
                  As to Religion,Their Religion. it may be said they have not any at all. Of all the Inhabitants, not
one can write or read, and yet they have certain Traditions, upon which they have framed
a certain shadow of Religion. For they believe the World hath been from all Eternity,
and shall last Eternally. They believe the immortality of the Soul, and thence it comes,
that when any one dies, they build before his door a little Hut of bows of trees, set
Banners at the four corners, and within the Hut a wooden Vessel full of water, with a
Cane-spoon, out of a perswasion, that the souls of the deceased return every day to the
Hut, to purifie themselves. 'Tis true, most of them do it purely out of compliance with
custome, and know not the reason thereof: but aged persons are not ignorant of it. They
believe also, that Souls shall find good or evil in the other life, according to what they
have done in this, and affirm, that to go out of this World into the other, they pass over a
very narrow Bridge of Canes, under which runs a Channel full of all kind of filth and
nastiness, into which the wicked being fallen do there languish eternally; but that the good
Souls pass into a pleasant and delightful Countrey, of which they speak, much after the
same rate the Poets speak of the Elysian fields. But there are very few comprehend these
mysteries??? or think of any other life then the present.
                  Their sins are much different from ours.Their Sins. Murther, Theft, Adultery, and other Crimes,
are not so much as slight offences among them, and they make so little account of simple
Fornication, that they only laugh at it, reprove it not  their Children. They are forbidden
marrying before Twenty, or twenty one years of age, yet it is lawful for them
to cajol and debauch a neighbours Wife, so he know nothing of it. But it is a great Sin

among them, to have cover'd the privy parts at a certain season of the year; to wear several
Garments, or one only of Silk, at a time when they should have worn them of Cotton;
not to have destroyed Children in the Mothers womb; and to have born any before
thirty five or thirty six years of Age. These are the sins, which in their judgment deserve
eternal pains; all the rest is only foolery.
                  They adore several pretended Divinities,Their Gods. but among others two, one whereof is called
Tamagisanhach, and the other Sariahsingh. The former hath his abode in the South, and
contributes to the generation of man, who receives from this God, only what is excellent
and acceptable, either in his body or mind. They affirm, that his Wife, whom they call
Taxankpanda, lives in the East, whence she is heard, when it thunders towards that quarter,
speaking to her Husband, Tamasgisanhach, and chiding him, for suffering the Earth to be
too long without Rain, and that thereupon her Husband causes it immediately to Rain.
The other God hath his retreat in the North, and destroys all the excellency which Tamagisanhach
hath bestowed on man, by disfiguring his face with the Small Pox, and sending
him several other Inconveniencies. Whence it comes they invoke them both, one, that
they may not be injured by him, and the other that he may prevent Sariasingh from doing
them any mischief. Besides these, they have two other Gods, who have the oversight
of War, named Talafula, and Tapaliape; but they are invocated only by men.
                  There is not any Nation,Women only employed about their Mysteries. that falls within my knowledge at least, but makes use of
Men in the Religious Service of their Divinity, only this we now speak of employs only
Women. They call them Inibs, and all their Worship consists of Prayers and Sacrifices.
The Sacrifices and Offerings which they make their Gods, are Swine, Rice, Areca, some
of their kind of Drink, and Deer, and wild Boars heads. Having fed heartily upon them,
the Priestesses rise, and make a long Prayer, during which, a man shall see their Eyes turning
in their Heads, they fall to the ground, and make dreadful cries and shrieks. After
these efforts, they lie down all along upon the ground, immoveable as Statues, and become
so heavy, that five or six persons can hardly raise them. 'Tis while they are in this
posture, as they affirm, that their Gods communicate themselves to them, for an hour or
better. Then they get up on the top of the Pagode, go from one end of it to the other, and
there say their Prayers again; which being ended, they strip themselves stark naked,
shew their privy parts to their Gods, smiting them with their hands, and call for water to
wash themselves, in the presence of a great number of persons. 'Tis true, the men are not
guilty of so much devotion as to come often to these Assemblies; and the women, who
most frequent them, make a shift to get so drunk, that they hardly perceive what is done
before their faces.
                  Every house hath a particular place appointed for the devotions of the Family,Their devotion ( Quakerisin) where
they invocate the Gods, and where the women make their offerings of what is spent every
day in the house: but in case of sickness and some other misfortune, they call the Inibs
to do that Service, which is performed with many extravigant Ceremonies. They also
foretel good and ill fortune, rain and fair weather, and they have the power to drive away
the Devil, after a very ridiculous manner. They pursue him with a great noise, having
a Iaponnese Knife in their hand, and affirm, that by that means they drive him away so far,
as that he is forc'd to cast himself into the Sea, or at least into some River, where he is
drown'd. There are to be seen also at Cross-ways, and upon great Roads, a kind of Altars,
loaden with Offerings for their Gods, and many other impertinent Devotions may be observed
among them; which the Dutch endeavour to abolish by degrees, by introducing
Christianity into the Countrey, wherein they have had hitherto good success.
               
               
                  
                  CHINA.
                  THe great and vast Kingdom,The Kingdom of China. which we call China, takes up the most Easterly part
of all Asia. Marc Paulo calls it Mangi; the Tartars term it Cathay, and there are
some who name it also Singely, or Tame. The Chineses themselves give it the
name of Chunghoa, or Chungque, whereof the former signifies the Middle Kingdom, in as
much as they believe they inhabit the midst of the Universe; and the other, the Middle
Flower, or Garden, and know not the names given it by Forreigners, save only that they
know the Tartars call them Mangin, that is, Barbarians.
                  We affirm it to be the utmost Province of all Asia Eastward;Its Frontiers. for beyond it there is only
the Sea, which the Chineses call Tung, that is, of the East. It hath towards the North
great Tartary, from which it is divided by a Mountain of many Leagues extent, and where
that fails, the defect is supplied by that admirable Wall, which reaches from the extremities
of the Province of Leaotung, to the River Croceus, upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom
of Tibet, being in length three hundred German Leagues. Towards the West, it hath the
Kingdoms of Kiang, Vusucang, and Bengala; and towards the South and South-west, the
Conchinchine, and the Sea.
                  The Kingdom extends it self from the Tropick of Cancer to the fifty third Degree of
Latitude,Its extent, and comprehends in its length all the Southern parts, which lie between the hundred
and thirtieth, and the hundred and sixtieth Degrees. But that we may speak more
pertinently of it, we shall, with them, affirm, that China is sixty nine thousand five hundred
and sixteen Diez, which make three thousand Spanish Leagues, in compass, and eighteen
hundred in length. This account is made according to their Geometry and their Measures,
which they distinguish into Ly, Pu, and Cham. They call Ly such a space of ground
as is of the extent of a mans voice. Ten of these Ly's make a Pu, that is, about
two Leagues, and ten Pu's make a Cham, that is, a good dayes journey; and according
to this Calculation, they find the number of the Diez, which we laid down before.
                  It is divided into fifteen great Provinces,The Provinces whereof it consists. six whereof, to wit, Peking, Xantung, Kiangnan,
or Nanking, Chekian, Fokien, and Quangtung, are maritime, and the other nine are mediterranean.
Of the nine last, those of Quangsi, Kiangsi, Huquang, Honan, and Xansi, are the
more Northerly; and those of Xensi, Suchuen, Queicheu, and Iunnan, the more Westerly.
It hath, besides these, towards the East, those of Leaotung and Corea; but these do not
properly belong to China. There are accounted in it a hundred forty and five great principal
Cities, and twelve hundred sixty three of a middle sort, such as might pass elsewhere
for great Cities; in as much as the difference of the Chinese names of Fu and Cheu, which
they give their places, proceeds only from their qualities, who have the command of
them. For they call Fu, such places as have a Governour in chief; and Cheu, or Hien,
those, where there is only a simple Mandorin; though the places are many times of equal
bigness.
                  The Cities are all built after the same manner, square, with good Brick-walls, plaister'd
over with the same Earth as they make the Porcelane of, which in process of time grows
so hard, that it will not be broken with a Hammer: which makes them last so long, that
it hath been observ'd, some of them have stood above two thousand years; yet is there not
the least appearance of any change to be seen in them. The Walls are very broad, and
flank'd with Towers, built after the ancient way of Architecture, much resembling the
Fortifications of the Romans.
                  Two spacious Streets commonly divide their Cities into a perfect Cross,The 
                      and they are so
straight, that though they reach the whole length of the City, how great soever it be, yet
may a man see, from the middle, the four Gates of it. Several other Streets abut upon
these in divers places of the City, where they are disposed into Market-places, and other
publick conveniences. The Houses are fair and well built, especially those of Persons of
Quality, which have their Gardens, Orchards, Groves, Fountains, Conduits, Duckingponds,
Aviaries and Warrens; and they are painted or whiten'd on the out-side. They
have most of them three Doors all on the same side, whereof that which stands in the
middle is bigger then the other two, and they are for the most part so neatly wrought, that

it must be confessed, all we know of Architecture comes not near their excellency in it:
and they do all things the more magnificently, in that they want neither excellent Workmen,
nor Materials to embellish their Structures.
                  There is no Kingdom or Commonwealth in the World, where they are so careful, not
only of repairing the High-wayes, but also in ordering all things so, as that Travellers
may not want any convenience, in so much that a man shall find Mountains levell'd, and
wayes cut through Rocks, yet more even and incomparably better paved then our
Streets, nay then even those of the City of Xuntien, the Metropolis of this Monarchy,
whereof we shall give a short account anon, when we come to the description of its Provinces.
                  The Province of Peking is so called,The Province of Peking. Its Frontiers. by reason of the City of Xuntien, where the Emperour
of China ordinarily resides; for the word signifies, a Northerly Palace, as that
of Nanking, a Southerly Palace, but the true name of it is Pecheli. It hath towards the
East, the Gulf of Canghai, which divides it from Corea; towards the North-east the Province
of Leaotung; towards the North the Wall, which divides it from that of Tartary
which lies beyond the Deserts of Xamo; towards the West, the Province of Xansi, from
which it is divided by the Mountain of Heng; towards the North-west, the Province
of Honan, and the River of Croceus; and towards the South and South-east, the Province
of Xantung. It hath eight great Cities, to wit, Xuntien, Paoting, Hokien, Chinting, Xunte,
Quanping,Its Cities. Taming, and Iungping, which might pass for so many Provinces, since there are
under their jurisdiction a hundred twenty and seven Cities of a middle sort. But what
most think very strange, is, that though the more Northerly part of this Province reaches
not beyond the forty second degree, yet is it so cold there, that from the midst of November
to March, all the Rivers are frozen up.
                  The Register which the Chineses keep of their Country,The number of its Families. makes it appear that there are
in this Province, a hundred and eighteen thousand, nine hundred eighty nine Families, consisting
of above three millions, four hundred and fifty thousand persons, and that it payes
yearly to the Emperour, six hundred and one thousand, one hundred fifty and three Bags
of Rice,Its Revenues. Wheat and Millet; two hundred twenty five pounds of Raw Silk, at twenty
ounces to the pound; forty five thousand, one hundred and thirty pieces of Silk-Stuffes;
thirteen thousand, seven hundred forty eight pound of Cotton; eight millions, seven hundred
thirty seven thousand, two hundred eighty four Trusses of Hay and Straw for the
Emperours Stables; and a hundred and eighty thousand, eight hundred and seventy
Quintals of Salt, accounting a hundred twenty four pound to the Quintal; besides the
Money which comes in by the Customs: and yet this is one of the less fruitful Provinces
of China.
                  As to the City of Xuntien,Xuntien described. it is situated at the extremity of the Kingdom, towards the
North, about thirty Leagues from the great Wall. It owes its greatness, though in that
particular it comes short of Nanking, to Taicung, who lived at the beginning of the fifteenth
Age, and translated the Seat of the Empire from Nanking to this City. It is more
populous then that of Nanking, and must needs be more sumptuous, by reason of the Court,
and the great number of Souldiers which the King maintains there, as well for the safety
of the City, as that of his own person. On the South-side it is encompassed with a double
Ditch, and a double Wall; on the North-side it hath but one. This Wall is much
higher then those of any Cities in Europe, and so thick, that twelve Horse might ride abreast
upon it without touching one another. There is a Guard kept upon it in the nighttime,
with as much vigilance as if there were an open War; but in the day-time, the Gates
are kept only by Eunuchs, who stand there rather to receive the Duties of Entrance, then
for any safety of the City. This is the same City which Marc Paulo calls Cambalu, and
whereof the Tartars were possessed at that time.
                  The Streets of it are not paved;The Palace. so that in Winter a man goes up to the ankles in dirt;
and in the Summer, he is cover'd all over with dust: but this inconvenience hath forced
them to make use of an invention, whence they derive much greater conveniences. For
they all cover themselves with a thin Lawn, from the head to the waste, and by that
means, not being known, they are not obliged to salute any they meet; and so dressed
they may ride undiscover'd on horse-back all about the City; which yet is not very honourable
in Persons of Quality, who, by this convenience, save the charge it would be to
them to be carried in Chairs, whereas they may have Horses and Mules to hire at the corner
of every Street, at a very easie rate, three or four pence a day.
                  The Kings Palace is near a League in compass, and fortified with three good Walls, and
so many Ditches. It hath four Gates, whereof that on the South-side, which opens upon
the great Street of the City, is the fairest. Persons of Quality may go within the first

Wall, and Lords of the Councel go within the second; but within the third there go only
Women and Eunuchs who attend about the Kings person. They say this Palace consists,
within, of near eighty Halls, and, of those, four, which are the richest in the World;
besides the other Appartments, which are almost innumerable.
                  The Province of Xansi is not so great as that of Peking,The Province of Xansi. but more delightful, fertile and
populous. It bears not much Rice, but in requital, it affords the more Wheat and Millet,
and breeds abundance of Cattle. The Word Xansi signifies, Towards the West of the
Mountain.Its Frontiers. Accordingly, that of Heng divides it on the East-side from the Province of
Peking, as the great Wall of the Kingdom of Tanyu in Tartary does towards the North.
The River Croceus divides it, Westward, from the Province of Xensi, and, towards the South,
and South-east, from that of Honan.
                  It comprehends five great Cities,Its Cities to wit, Taiyuen, which is the Metropolis, Pingyang, Taytung,
Lugan, and Fuencheu, and fourscore and twelve of a middle rate, which contain, disposed
into 589959.Families Revenue. Families, above five millions of persons. It pays in every year 2274022
Sacks of Grain, 50. pound of raw Silk, 4770. pieces of Silk-stuffs, 3544850. Trusses of Hay
and Straw, and 420000. Quintals of Salt.
                  The Climate and Soil of this Province is fit for the Vine,The qualities of the Country. and the Grape here is excellent;
but the Chineses make no Wine. And there is one thing particular here, not to be
found elsewhere, which is, that as there are in other places Pits and Wells of Water, there
are here some of Fire. They dam them up so, as that they leave only some Holes, on which
they set their Pots with Meat to be dressed. There are here also good store of Pit-coal,
and certain Minerals which serve for Firing.
                  The Province of Xensi is,The Province of Xensi. no doubt, one of the greatest of all the Southern part of Asia.
It hath on the North, the Deserts of Xamo; towards the West and North-west, the Kingdoms
of Cascar and Tebet;Its Frontiers. towards the East, the River Croceus, which divides it from the
Province of Xansi; and towards the South, it is divided from the Provinces of Honan,
Suchuen,The number of its Families. and Huquang, by a high Mountain: It comprehends, in eight great Cities, and a
hundred and seven of middle rate, 831051. Families, and near four millions of persons.
The great Cities are Sigan, Fungciang, Hanchung, Pingleang, Cungehang, Linyao, Kingyang,
and Iengan.Its Revenues. It pays yearly 1929057. Sacks of Grain, 360. pounds of raw Silk, 9228.
pieces of Silk-stuffs, 772. pounds of Cotton, 128770. pieces of Cotton-cloath, and
1514749. Trusses of Hay and Straw.
                  There are in this Province some Gold Mines,Gold Mines. but there is a Prohibition made by the
Laws of this Country, that no search should be made into them, and yet there is abudance
of it found in the Rivers and Torrents, especially when the Rain brings down the Earth
from the neighbouring Mountains.Rhubarb. Rhubarb. grows here in great quantities, and it is ordered
with great care.
                  This Province affords also Musk,Musk. which is nothing but an Imposthume or Botch, fram'd
at the Navil of a certain Beast, of the bigness of a wild Goat, which the Chineses call Xe;
whence comes the word Xehiang (so they call the Musk) which signifies Scent of Musk.
The Reader may take this for certain, whatever those may endeavour to perswade people,
who have written concerning this Drug.
                  Though the Wall which divides China from Tartary enclose the three Provinces we
named before,The great Wall. as also that of Leatoung, yet is it not of the length our Cosmographers assign
it; for from the Gulf, where the River Yalo falls into the Sea, and where the Wall
begins, to the City Kin, where it ends, there are not above twenty Degrees, which make but
three hundred German Leagues. This miraculous Structure is continued without any
interruption, unless it be near the City of Siven, in the Province of Peking, where an inaccessible
Mountain supplies its place, and defends the Kingdom against the invasion of the
Tartars, as well as the Wall it self. It hath Gates and Sluces for the passage of the Rivers
which come out of Tartary, and hath Houses, Redoubts and Forts, from place to place, for
the quartering of the Souldiers appointed for the keeping of it; in which work the Emperour
of China employs a million of men. It is about thirty Cubits high, and about
twelve, and in some places fifteen thick. The Chineses call it Vanli Ching, that is, a Rampier???
or Wall of ten thousand Stadia, rather to express an extraordinary work, then assign
the just greatness of it, by any certain measure: since that two hundred and fifty Stadia
of that Country making a Degree, it would follow that the said Wall must take up forty
Degrees, that is, more ground then all China does.
                  They say it was built by Xius,By whom built. King or Emperour of China, chief of the Family of Cina,
who having usurped the Kingdom from the Princes of the House of Cheva, causd that
Wall to be made, as well to satisfie his own humour, which was to be magnificent in his
Buildings, as to prevent the Incursions of the Tartars, over whom he had many Advantages.

He began it in the year 1215. which was the 22. of his Reign, and imploy'd
so many men about it, that it was finished in less then five years.
                  The Province of Xantung,The Province of Xantung. Its Frontiers. hath, towards the North, that of Peking, and the Gulf of
Cang; towards the East, the Sea; towards the South, the Province of Nanking, from which
it is divided by the River Croceus, and the Sea; and towards the West, the Channel of
Iun, which joyns those two Rivers, and hath twenty Sluces, as also the River Guei. All
these Rivers make this Province so fertile, that they say one year brings forth as much as
will sustain it ten years afterwards, and that it may communicate to its Neighbours, the
Wheat, Millet, Rice, Barley, and Pulse, which the Inhabitants cannot consume. Poultry and
Eggs may be had there in a manner for nothing: Feasants, Partridges, Quails, and Hares,
are very cheap; and for less then three pence a man may buy ten pound of fish.
                  But what this Province is most remarkable for, is Silk,Silks. which here is not got by the pains
people take in other places in keeping Silk-worms, but it grows in the fields, upon Trees,
where certain Worms, like Caterpillars, blow it, not in a Cod, but in white threads, which
are found upon the Hedges, and may be used as advantageously as the ordinary Silk, though
it be somewhat courser.
                  It hath six great Cities,Its Cities and Families. to wit, Cinan, Yenchen, Fungchang, Cingcheu, Teugeheu, and Laicheu,
seventy two other considerable ones, and comprehends, in 770555. Families, near seven
millions of persons.
                  It contributes yearly 2812179. Sacks of Corn,Its Revenue. 54990. pieces of Silk-stuffs, 52449.
pounds of Cotton, and 3824290. Trusses of Hay and Straw; besides the duties paid there,
which amount to above ten millions of Gold.
                  The Province of Honan derives its name from its scituation,The Province of Honan. it being seated towards
the South of the River Croceus, for the word Honan signifies, towards the South of the
River.
                  It hath on the East,Its Frontiers. the Province of Nanking; North and North-east, those of Xantung
and Peking; North-west, that of Xansi; towards the West, that of Xensi; and towards
the South, the Province of Huquang.
                  This Province lies in the middle of this great Territory,Its Cities and Families. and is so delightful, that the
Chineses say, it is in China, what Italy is in Europe, and Tourain in France. It comprehends
in eight great Cities, and a hundred less considerable ones, 589296. Families, consisting of
above 5000000. of persons. The eight Cities are Caifang, Queite, Changte, Gueihoi,
Hoaiking,Its Revenui. Honan, Nanyang, and Iuning. It contributes yearly 2414477. Sacks of Corn,
23509. pound of raw Silk, 9959. pieces of Silk-stuffs, 341. pieces of Cotton-stuffs, and
288744. Trusses of Hay and Straw.
                  The Province of Suchuen,The Province of Suchuen. Its Frontiers. that is, four waters, is one of the greatest of all China; and
in regard it is a Frontier-Province towards the Indies, it thence comes, that the Inhabitants
are somewhat of the humour of the Indians. It hath towards the East, the Province of
Huquang; towards the South-east, that of Queicheu; South, that of Iunnan; West, the
Kingdom of Tibet; and towards the North and North-west, the Province of Xensi, and
the people whom they call Coningangi, and Kiang.

other four which are fortified, and contains in 464129. Families, above 2200000.
men.
                  It pays 6106660. Sacks of Rice,Its Revenue. 6339. pound of Silk, 749117. Quintals of Salt.
                  The true Radix Sina,Radix Sina. which the Chineses call Folin, as also the wild kind of it, is found
only in the Province of Suchuen, and grows there under the Earth, much like Toad-stools,
or rather as that fruit which the Indians call Patatas, or Potatoes. Some are of opinion,
that it is bred of the Gum which falls from the Pine-trees, which taking root, forms a fruit
of the bigness of the Indian Nut (or Cocos) having a white meat within, which the Chineses
use with good success in Medicine. This Province brings forth also the best Rhubarb,
and great store of yellow Amber.
                  The Province of Huquang,The Province of Huquang. Its Frontiers. that is, extended Lake, derives its name from the Lake of Tungting,
and hath towards the North, the Province of Honan; on the North, that of Nanking,
towards the East, that of Kiangsi; towards the South, that of Quangsi; toward the
South-west, that of Queicheu; and towards the West, that of Suchueu.
                  It comprehends in fifteen great, and a hundred and eight less considerable Cities, 531686
Families,Its Families. and near five millions of persons. Its great Cities are, Vuchang, Hanyang, Siangyang,

and 17977.Its Revenue. pieces of Silk-Stuffs.
                  
                     
The Province of Kiangsi,The Province of Kiangsi: Its Frontiers. hath towards the East those of Nanking and Fokien, towards
the South, part of the same Province of Fokien, and of that of Quantung; towards the
West, the Province of Huquang; and towards the North, part of that of Nanking. This
Province is so populous, and the people thereof multiplies so strangely, that it in a manner
supplies all the Provinces of the Kingdom, for which reason the Chineses call them Kiangsois,
Rats.
                  It hath twelve great Cities,Its Cities and Families. and sixty seven lesser ones, wherein are numbred above
1136659. Families, and in them above 6550000. persons. Its chief Cities are called,
Nanchang, Iocheu, Quangsin, Nankang, Kienkiang, Kienchang, Vucheu, Linkiang, Xuicheu,
Iuvencheu, Cancheu and Nangan.
                  It contributes yearly 1616600. Sacks of Rice,Its Revenues. 8230. pound of raw Silk, and 10516.
pieces of Silk-Stuffs.
                  What is particular to this Province is,Porcelane made in Kiangsi. that here is made most of the Porcelane, which
is carried all over the rest of the world. There is but one Village, and that under the
jurisdiction of the City of Feuleang, where these Vessels are made, of a kind of Earth
brought thither from the City of Hoeicheu, in the Province of Kiangnan, or Nanking, yet
so, as that the Inhabitants of that place cannot make any Porcelane, or that any reason can
be given, why the same Earth should receive, in a strange Province, the form which cannot
be given it at home. It is white as Chalk, and it is laid a soaking certain dayes, to be reduced
to a Paste; and to give it a colour, they put thereto some Woad, which grows in abundance,
in most of the Provinces of China.
                  The Province of Nanking,The Province of Nanking. which hath not been called Kiangnan, but since the Tartars
became the Masters of it, is no doubt the chiefest of all the Provinces of China, though the
Seat of the Empire was sometime since translated into Peking, by reason of the vicinity of
the Tartars.
                  It hath towards the East and North-east,Its Frontiers. the Sea; towards the North, the Province of
Xangtung; towards the North-west, that of Honan; towards the West, that of Huquang;
towards the South-west, that of Kiangsi; and towards the South, that of Chekiang. It
comprehends in its extent fourteen great Cities,Its Cities. to wit, Kianquing, which is the Metropolis,
Fungyan, Sucheu, Sungkiang, Chancheu, Chinkiang, Yangcheu, Hojaigan, Lucheu, Ganking,
Taiping, Ninke, Chicheu, and Hoeicheu, and a hundred and ten less considerable ones,
wherein there are 1969816. Families,Its Families and Revenue. out of which may be taken near ten millions of
men. It contributes yearly 5995034. Sacks of Rice, 6863. pound of raw Silk, 28452.
pieces of Silk-Stuffs, 2077. pieces of Linnen-cloth; (the Cotton is converted into money)
and 705100. Quintals of Salt, and 5804217. Trusses of Hay and Straw.
                  But what will startle the belief of the Reader,The prodigious Revenue of one Provinc. is, that besides all mentioned before, this
Province pays in yearly into the Exchequer, above sixty millions of Crowns. This is the
Province, if any in the Kingdom, which is most inclined to civility, and where there are
most Learned men.
                  The Province of Chekiang,The Province of Chekiang. Cities. is the most considerable of all the Provinces of China, next
the last named, and that of Peking. It hath eleven great Cities, to wit, Hancheu, Kiabing,
Hucheu, Niencheu, Kinhoa, Kiucheu, Cheucheu, Xaoing, Ningpo, Taicheu, and Vencheu, and
sixty three of a middle sort.
                  It hath towards the East, the Sea, and Iapan; towards the South and South-west, the
Province of Fokien; and towards the North and North-west, the Province of Nanking.
The number of its Families amounts to 1242135. and may comprehend 4525470. persons.Families.
                  
                  It pays yearly to the Emperour 2510299. Sacks of Rice,Its Revenue. 370299. pounds of raw Silk,
2574. pieces of Silk-stuffs, besides such Stuffs as are wrought with Gold and Silver, which are
brought thence four times in the year by the Kings Ships, to be distributed among those,
whom his Majesty permits by an express priviledge to wear thereof; 444769. Quintals of
Salt, and 8704491, Trusses of Hay and Straw. Besides all this, it sends into the Exchequer,
the yearly sum of above thirty millions.
                  There are in this Province whole Forrests of Mulberry trees,Its abundance in Silk??? which maintain such abundance
of Silk worms, that it is only this Province, in a manner, which supplies the Indies,
and all Europe, with that kind of Silk which is called China-Silk. They cut and order
the Mulberry-trees there, as the Vine is dressed in France; the Inhabitants having
found it by experience, that the least and tenderest Leaves produce the finest Silk. Nay,
they can so well distinguish the Silk of these Worms that have been kept with the first
Leaves, from that which comes from the second Leaves, that the price of the one is much
below that of the other.
                  
                     
In this Province is the City,The City of Quinsay. which Marc Paulo calls Quinsay. The name of it then
was Lingan, and it is called in the Chinese Language Kingsu, that is, a Royal Seat, upon this
account, that Koakungkin, Emperour of China, retreated thither, when he was pursued by
the Tartars, who were entred his Kingdom. Now it is called Hangcheu, and if we correct
in some things what the foresaid Author sayes of it, we shall find it comes not much
short of the greatness he assigns it.
                  For what he sayes of the ten thousand Bridges that are to be seen there,Marc Paulo justified. is very certain,
if we comprehend in that number those which are about the City; as also the triumphal
Arches, which in regard of their being vaulted, are numbred among the Bridges. The
Lake he speaks of is not properly within the City, but so near it, that there are so many
Bridges built thereon, and the sides of it are covered with so many Pagodes, and other publick
and private Structures, that it may well be accounted part of the City.
                  What the same Author sayes further of the Mountain of Chinghoangh, which is within
the City; of the Tower, wherein the hours are measured by an Hour-glass, and are marked
with Golden letters a foot and a half in length;The greatness of the City of Hangcke. of its Streets being paved with Freestone;
of its scituation in a Fenny place; of the great number of its Rivulets, and of
the River Cientang's, being a Germane League in breadth, is very certain; as also what he
affirms of its compass, to wit, that it is above a hundred Italian Leagues about, taking
in all its Suburbs; which included, it may be fifty Stadia in length, and so much at least
in breadth.
                  There are numbred within the City at least fifteen thousand Priests, sixty thousand persons,
whose Profession it is to work in Silk, and so vast a number of people, that it is reported
there are spent there every day ten thousand Sacks of Rice, and above a thousand Hogs,
besides the Cows, Goats, Sheep, Dogs, Fowl, and other Creatures; though most of the Inhabitants
believe the transmigration of Souls, and abstain from Flesh.
                  The Province of Fokien,The Province of Fokien: which Marc Paulo calls Fugui, hath on the East and South, the
Sea; on the South-west, the Province of Quantung; West and North-west, that of Kiangsi;
and North, that of Chekiang.
                  It hath nine great Cities,Its Frontiers. Cities. to wit, Focheu, which is the Metropolis, Civencheu, Cancheu,
Kienning, Ienping, Tincheu, Hinghoa, Xaoun, and Foning, and fourty eight less considerable
ones; 509200. Families,Families and Revenues. and near two millions of men. It pays yearly 883115.
Sacks of Rice, 194. pounds of raw Silk; 600. pieces of Silk-stuffs.
                  But its greatest Revenue consists in the Customs that are paid upon Commodities; it
being certain, that excepting only Macao in the Province of Quantung, where the Portuguez
drive a great Trade, all the Musk, Precious Stones, Silk, Quicksilver, Silk-stuffs,
Linnen-cloth, Cottons, Iron and Steel, and all those other Commodities, which the Chineses
carry by Sea into Iapan, Fermosa, the Philippine Islands, Celebes, Iava, and other places
in the Indies,The Inhabitants of Fokien trade most out of the Kingdom. come only out of this Province. There is such abundance of Ships in Fokien,
that it is reported, that heretofore when the Emperour of China intended a war against the
Iaponneses, the Inhabitants of this Province proffered to furnish him with as many Boats
as would make a Bridge between that Island and the Continent of China. Every City almost
of this Province hath its particular Language, and that so different from what is spoken
in any other City, that they can hardly understand one the other; nay they are ignorant
of the common Language of the Country, which all persons of any quality speak in
the other Provinces.
                  The Province of Quantung,The Province of Quantung. is also one of the most Maritime Provinces of all China. It
hath towards the West-north-west, the Kingdom of Tunking; North-west, the Province
of Quangsi; North, those of Huquang and Kiangsi; and North-east, that of Fokien. All
the rest of it lies upon the Sea.Its Frontiers. It hath ten great Cities,Cities. to wit, Quangcheu, Xaocheu, Nanbiung,
Hoeicheu, Chaocheu, Chaoking, Kaocheu, Kiencheu, Luicheu, and Kiuncheu, and seventy
two lesser ones, and among the rest that of Macao, whereof we shall have somewhat
to say elsewhere:Families. Revenue. There are numbred in it 443360. Families, and near two millions of persons;
and it contributes 1017772. Sacks of Rice, and 37380. Quintals of Salt, besides
what it payes in ready money.
                  The Chineses affirm,The richest Province of China. that there are in this Province three things which are not to be seen
elsewhere; to wit, Mountains without Snow, Trees perpetually green, and Men who spit
bloud, in regard their Spittle is of a reddish colour, occasioned by their continuall chewing
of Bettele and Areca.
                  To this may be added,The industry of the Inhabitants. that there is no other Province in all China so rich in Gold,
Pearls, Precious Stones, Silk, Tin, Quicksilver, Sugar, Copper, Iron, Steel, Saltpeter, Calambac-wood,
&c. as this is. It hath this further particularity, that the Musket and Pistol
barrels made in that Province, never break, though never so much over-charged, but only
open, to make way for what cannot get out at the mouth.
                  
                     
The Inhabitants are more industrious in imitation then invention: but they are so excellent
at the former, that no Manufacture or rarity can be brought thither out of these
parts, which they will not do as well as the Europeans; and among others, they are
so great Masters in all Gold-smiths work, that what is done in Europe comes not near
theirs.
                  The City of Macao or Amagao, that is, Good Haven, is famous on this account, that
only the Portuguez trade thither, excluding all others; and that it is the Episcopal Seat
of all those parts. Their particular trading is with the City of Quancheu, whither they
are permitted to come twice a year to the Fair, at which time they put off thirteen hundred
Chests of Silk-stuffs, Sattins, Damasks, &c. Every Chest containing a hundred and
fifty pieces, and carry thence for them, two thousand five hundred Wedges of Gold, of
ten Toels each, that is, a hundred and thirty Crowns; eight hundred pound of Musk,
and abundance of Gold Thread, Silk, Pearls, precious Stones, and several other Commodities,
which they carry to Malacca and Goa, to be thence distributed into other parts of
the World.
                  The Province of Quangsi is not so large nor so fertile as the forementioned;The Province of Quangsi. yet hath it
eleven great Cities;Its Cities. to wit, Queillen, the Metropolis, Lieuchou, Kingyen, Pinglo, Gucheu,
Cincheu, Nanning, Taiping, Suming, Chingan, and Tienchen, which have under their jurisdiction
ninety nine lesser ones.Frontiers. It hath East and North-east, the Province of Quantung;
North, that of Queicheu; South and South-west, the Kingdom of Tunking or Gunan;
and West, that of Iunnan. They number in it 186719. Families,Families and Revenue. and above 1500000.
men; and contributes 431359 Sacks of Rice.
                  The Province of Queicheu is the least considerable of all the Provinces of China,The Province of Queicheu. as
containing but eight ordinary Cities;Its Cities. to wit, Queiang, Sucheu, Sunan, Chiniven, Xecien,
Tunggin, Liping and Tucho, which have four other lesser Cities under them. It hath but
45305. Families, and about 200000. men. The Country is hilly and uneven; so that it
yielding but little Corn,Revenue. it contributes but 47658. Sacks of Rice, and 5900 pieces of Linnen-cloth.
But there is not any Province affords more Quicksilver, or breeds better Horses,
then this doth.
                  Heretofore this made not a Province by it self,Frontiers. but depended partly on that of Suchuen,
partly on that of Huguang; whereof the one is towards the North and North-west of
it, and the other, North-east. The Province of Quangsi is its Frontier towards the South
and South-east; and that of Iunnan towards the West.
                  The Province of Iunnan is the most Westerly Province of all China;The Province of Iunnan??? for it hath East
and North-east, the Provinces of Quangsi and Quincheu; North, that of Suchuen; North-west,Its Frontier???
the Kingdom of Tibet; South-west, that of Mien; and South and South-east, that of
Laos,Its wealth. and part of Tunking. This is, no doubt, one of the richest Provinces of the Kingdom,
and there would be more Gold found in it, if the Veins of the Earth were a little
more opened. It affords also yellow Amber, Rubies, Saphirs, Agats, Musk, Silk, Benjamin,
excellent Horses,Cities. Elephants, &c. It hath eleven great Cities, to wit, Iunnan, Tali, Lingan,
Cubiung, Chinkiang, Munghoa, Quangnan, Quanst, Chinisien, Iungning, and Xunning, under
which are eighty four lesser Cities.Families and Revenue. There are number'd in it 132958. Families, and
about 1433000. men, and it contributes 1400568. Sacks of Rice, and 56965. Quintals of
Salt.
                  By the vast extent we have assign'd the Kingdom of China,There are both black and white Chineses. it may be judg'd, that its
Provinces lying in so different Climates, it must follow, that the Qualities of its Air and
Soil are also different. Accordingly, there is so vast a difference between the Inhabitants
of the Island of Hainan, which is in the Torrid Zone, and part of the Province of Quantung,
which comes near it, and those of the Province of Peking, which is the more Northerly
of all China, that a man might take the one for the Moors of Fez in Barbary, and the
others for Germans or Suedes. I speak as to their colour; for these are white, those black;
and there are some more or less swarthy, according as the Provinces they live in are more
or less Southerly and Northerly.
                  The same difference is to be observed in the Fruits.The difference of Fruits in China. For the more Southerly Provinces
bring forth Cocoes, Bannana's, and such other Fruits as grow only in hot Countreys; and
others bring forth Figs, Apples, Pears, Chesnuts, and such Fruits as are common in Europe.
But it may be said in general of China, that there is not any other Country more pleasant
or more fertile then it. 'Tis true, it is much obliged to Nature, from whose liberality it
hath Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Musk, Silk, Salt, and all sorts of precious Gums and
Drugs; but it must be confessed withall, that it is the labour and industry of the Inhabitants,
and the mildness of its Government, which occasions this abundance of provisions,
and consummates the felicity wherein they live.
                  
                     
The Country is so populous, that to maintain so strange a number of people, it is but
necessary,The Chineses hate idleness. that all the Ground it takes up should produce somewhat or other. They have
a natural aversion for idleness; but if they had not, the Laws have made such provision, in
this particular, that there is not any Crime punished with greater infamy then this Vice.
Another humour of theirs is, that they are lovers of good Chear, and pride it much in
wearing good Clothes, and having their Houses well furnished, so that, to live handsomly,
they are obliged to take pains. Hence comes it, that a man shall not see a Mountain but
is planted, not a Hill but is cultivated; no Plain, but is sown; no Fen, but some
advantage is made thereof; nay, to use the common expression, not an inch of Ground,
but brings forth somewhat or other, to requite their labour, who bestow their pains
on it.
                  This Country breeds all sort of living Creatures,China Fruits better then ours. and brings forth all the Fruits and
Simples we have in Europe, but all much better in their several kinds then any we have;
as may be seen by those Oranges, the Plant whereof was brought thence into Portugal,
and the Fruit whereof is so highly esteem'd every where. The like may be said of Melons,
and other Fruits, especially Plums, which are most excellent there, and so wholsome,
that they never burden the Stomack, though a man eat never so many of them. There is
such abundance of Honey and Wax,Wax and Honey. that whole Fleets come thence loaden therewith; and
Sugar is so cheap that when it is dearest,Sugar. the Quintal, that is, a hundred twenty four pound,
may be bought between twenty four and thirty shillings sterling. A man may judge of
the quantities of Silk it produces, by the Stuffs which the Provinces pay in yearly to the
King, besides the Stuffs and raw Silk which are carried into all other parts of the World.
The high Grounds bring forth Wheat, Barly, Oats; and the low Grounds, Rice,
but in such abundance, that, when most dear, it is sold at a Crown the Coom, or four
Winchesters.
                  Fowl are sold there by the pound,Flesh very cheap. and when the Feathers are off, the ordinary rate is
three half pence a pound, and all other Flesh proportionably: for there is so much Cattel,
that a fat Cow is not worth above ten shillings; a Buffer a Crown; a Hog, the flesh
whereof is very delicate,Spice. twenty pence. Nay, even Spices are so cheap there, that under
a Crown a man may buy four hundred Nutmegs, and for half a Crown two pound of
Cloves; which proceeds hence, that Provisions yielding in a manner nothing in the Country,
the Chineses truck them with so much profit to the Moluccas and the other neighbouring
Islands, that they can afford these Drugs cheaper then they may be had at the places
where they grew. The Sea, which encompasses a great part of this vast Territory, and the
Rivers which are as it were so many Veins and Arteries to this vast Body, supply it with
such abundance of Fish, that it is to be had in a manner for nothing.
                  For there is hardly any City that hath the convenience of a River, but the Inhabitants
keep a great number of Cormorants,Their fishing. which they make use of in order to fishing. They
are kept fasting one day, and the next they carry them to the water-side, near several Boats
half full of water, whereto they are fastened with a Cord tied under their Wings, and
having bound them about their Necks a little above the Stomack, they let them go into
the River, where they fill, with Fish, that Skin which stretches like a bag under the Throat,
and come and disburden themselves, of what they had taken, in the Boat whereto they
are fastened. This they do several times, at least till such time as the Master thinks they
have taken enough; and then he unties the String which ties up their Necks, and permits
them to go a fishing for themselves, and to feast themselves for two dayes: and by
this means they take more Fish then they are able to consume.
                  There is no Creature so common all over China as the Duck,How they breed Ducks. in regard they have a way
for the breeding of them, not known in other parts. They are kept in great Cages, made
of Canes, and set at the Sterns of great Boats, the Cages being so large, as they are able to
contain three or four thousand of them,How hatched. and they hatch the Eggs, in the Summer time, in
Cow-dung, or haply in the Dung of the Ducks themselves, which is very hot, leaving them
therein, till the generation be compleated, and then they break the Shells one against another,
to make way for their young ones to come out, with such a sleight, that it seldom happens
that any one of them miscarries.
                  In the Winter, they heighten the natural heat of the Dung by Fire, making a Bed of
Canes, raised three or four foot from the ground, upon which they set the Eggs between
two layers of Dung, and there is a Fire made under, to give them that degree of heat
which is requisite for the hatching of them. As soon as they are hatched, they dispose
them into the Cages, where they keep old Ducks, which receive them under their Wings,
and breed them up. When they are grown big enough to shift for themselves, they give
them in the morning a little Rice, but only so much as rather sharpens then satisfies the

Appetite, and then they open the Cages, to let them go over a kind of Hurdle of Canes to
the shore, where they suffer them to feed among the Rice, out of which they pick the
Weeds with so much ease and advantage to the Owner, that he who breeds the Ducks is
sufficiently recompenced for his pains. In the evening, he gets all his Ducks together, and
makes them return into the Boat, with the noise of a Whistle or little Bell, which they observe
so exactly, that, though there are many times twenty or five and twenty thousand of
them together, yet will they all get very orderly into their Cages: and by this kind of
breeding, they are so cheap, that a man may have two or three for a penny.
                  As to the Inhabitants,The Inhabitants. they are well shaped, and for the most part of a good stature.
The Men have large Faces, are small Ey'd, and flat Nosed, wearing little or no Beard. They
never cut their Hair, nor pare the Nails of the left Hand, out of a perswasion, that their
Nails may be serviceable to them in climbing, when they shall be taken up into Heaven by
the Hair.
                  They are all clad after the same fashion,Their cloathing??? save that in the more Northerly Provinces, they
use Furs, and in the more Southerly, they go for the most part in Silk. Persons of great
quality have their Cassocks embroidered up to the Waste, but others have only a little Gold
or Silver about the extremities: and there is this distinction between married Men and
Batchelors, that the latter part their Hair upon the Forehead, and wear higher Caps then
the others.
                  The Women are very sumptuously clad,Their Women. having about them a great many Pearls and
precious Stones. They also paint, and dress their Heads with as much curiosity and advantage
as in any other place of the World. They have a particular affection of having
little feet; whence it comes, that the Mothers make it their business, so to straiten their
Daughters Feet, from their Infancy, that they are hardly able to go. Some are of opinion,
that this Custom was introduced by those who were desirous to accustom Women to a sedentary
life, whereto they are as it were condemned even from their birth. They are never
seen in the House; and it is very seldom they go abroad, which when they do, it is to
visit some of their nearest Relations; and then, they are so attended, and shut up in Palanquins,
that they cannot be seen.
                  The Men are ingenious enough,Are ingenious. and discover, by their Works, that they are not inferiour
to the Europeans. It is no easie matter for a Man to avoid the circumventions of
their Merchants, who make use of all imaginable Advantages in their Dealings. At every
Door there hangs a Table, containing a Catalogue of all the Commodities that are in
the Shop: and in regard all the Merchants of the same Body have their habitations in
the same quarter, a man finds, as soon as he comes into it, what is to be sold in all the Street.
                  They use Brass-money in no Province but that of Chekiang;Their Money. in all other parts of the
Kingdom, only Gold and Silver is current, which yet is received only by weight, without
any regard of the mark. Whence it comes, that no China Merchant but hath his Weights
about him, and such pieces of Money as are full weight, by which that which he receives
is to be weighed.
                  I am of opinion,The provision for the subsistance of the poor. that the provision, which is made in several parts of Europe, for the subsistance
of the Poor, was derived from China. Beggary, which is infamous in those who
are reduced thereto, and a shame to such as suffer it, in as much as it is a reproach of their
want of Charity, whose care it should be to remedy that inconvenience, is there very severely
forbidden; and there is in all Cities a particular Judge appointed for the Poor, who,
in order to their relief, takes the following course.
                  The very day he comes into that Employment, he publishes an Order, whereby he commands
all those who have any Children, either born weak or imperfect, or become such,
through sickness or any other accident, to come and make their cases known, that he may
examine whether they are capable of learning any Trade or not; and in case they are not,
whether the Parents are able to maintain them. If they are Orphans, and have no other
Friends able to keep them, they are disposed into Hospitals, where they are brought up at
the Kings charge. The same course is taken with maimed or decrepit Souldiers. They
are all lock'd up, and not permitted to go any more abroad. The Houses, where they put
up the Poor, have Gardens and Courts belonging to them, where they are permitted to
keep Poultry and Swine, as well for their divertisement as advantage, and the King appoints
a certain Overseer, who, joyntly with the ordinary Judge, makes a Visitation of the
Hospitals twice a year.
                  They do not put the blind into the number of those Poor who are accounted unable to
work; but they are employed in pulling the Bell at Smiths Forges, and other things
which do not much require the help of the fight. Maids that are blind are forced to a
Trade, which may be as gainful, but not so honest as some others.
                  
                     
I conceive I may also presume to affirm, that it is to China we are obliged for the Mystery
of Printing.Printing in China before we had it. For it is certain, we have it but since the year 1450. and that the Chineses
have some Books printed above seven hundred years since.
                  They have a way of Writing particular to themselves, not only upon this account, that
they make use of Figures rather then Characters,Their way of writing. in as much as they signifie entire words,
and do not represent the Letters; but also upon this, that, in their Writing they observe
an order wholly different from that of all other Nations. For these write either from the
left hand to the right, as all the Europeans do, or from the right to the left, as the Hebrews,
Arabians, and most of the other Nations of Asia do; but the Chineses write from the top
downwards, and in their Writing observe such equal distances, that there cannot be any
thing more exact. And to shew, that these Figures stand not for any word that hath any
particular signification in their Language, but that they express the same things, it is to be
noted, that the Chineses, who, when they speak, cannot understand one the other, by reason
of the diversity of the Idioms and Dialects that is among the Inhabitants of several Provinces,
make use of these Characters, not only to render themselves intelligible one to another,
all over the Kingdom, but also in their Commerce with the Iaponneses, and the Inhabitants
of Corea and Conchinchine, between whose Languages there is no more rapport, then
the English hath to the Greek or Arabian.
                  They make their Paper of the Bark of Bambus,Their Paper. or Canes, but so thin, that it will bear
writing but on one side, though they do not use Pens, but Pencils, as the Iaponneses do,
which only slide along the Paper, so that they write as fast, and cut their Characters so
neatly, that the best Pen-men in Europe are not to be preferred before them.
                  The King is at a vast charge, as well in the maintenance of the Schools, where they are
taught to read and write, as also the other Elements and Sciences, as in that of the Universities,
where are taught Philosophy, natural and moral, Astrology, and the other Sciences.
There passes not a year, but there is a Visitation made, at which the Professors and Scholars
are examined; and they who express an inclination to study are recompenced; such as apply
not themselves thereto as they ought, are punished.
                  The Visitor having ended the general Examen,The dignity of Loytia. makes another particular one for those
who aspire to the quality of Loytia, a Dignity there like that of our Doctors. True
it is, that they give this Title to all nobly descended; but in matter of Learning, it is a
Degree, conferr'd, by giving the Graduate a permission to wear a Girdle, by which he
is distinguished from others. For the King bestows this quality, as the Princes of our
parts confer Honours on those who have deserved them by their services, or are so much
in favour, either with them or such as are about them, as to get them by Letters Patents.
This promotion of Doctors is done with as great Ceremonies, as in any European University.
                  But indeed this Nation is so punctual in point of Ceremony,The Chineses very ceremonious. that it goes beyond any
other, even to importunity. The first Lectures they make to Youth are those of Complements,
whereof there are whole Books, that they may be sure to have them upon all occasions.
If a man hath but once seen a person, he is obliged to salute him, and this is not
done with the Hat, but closing the left hand, they put it into the right, and so both to the
breast, with a low inclination of the head, accompanied with protestations to confirm what
they would express by their gestures.
                  Persons of Quality meeting in the Street, make a stand, joyn their hands by putting the
fingers one within another, and stretching out the arms bow-wise, they do their reverences
with low inclinations, and continue a good while in that posture, proffering one another
the way. When there is no equality between the persons who meet, the inferiour gives
way to the other, does him reverence, and lets him pass by. He who goes to speak about
any business to a Loytia at his own Lodgings, kneels down as soon as he comes into the
Room, and advances, and continues in that posture till he hath done speaking, or delivered
his Petition, and having done his business, he retires still kneeling, without turning his back
on the Loytia.
                  If a man standing at his own Door, or in the Street, espy a Kinsman, or Friend, coming
out of the Country, if he who lives in the City thinks not himself well enough clad to
welcome his Friend as he would, he will pretend not to have seen him, go into his Lodging,
put on his best Clothes, and then will come and meet his Friend, and salute him, as if
he had not seen him before. If he meet him in the Street at some distance from his own
House, the first question he makes is, whether he hath din'd or supp'd, if not, he will carry
him to the next Tavern, and treat him magnificently with Fish and Flesh; if he hath din'd,
he will give him only a Collation of Fruits and Conserves.
                  
                     
They are very sumptuous in their Treatments, and have a custom different from what is
done in all other places.Their Feast??? They set up as many Tables as there are guests; but instead of
cloths, which would hide the beauty of the gilding and painting, wherewith they are enriched,
they have only carpets of Damask, Taffata, or some other Silk stuff, which covering
only the edges thereof, hang down to the ground. At the four corners of the Table
they set a paper of Fruits and Conserves for the Desert, and several figures of Sugar, made
and painted to the life, and flowers for the divertisement of the Eye, and they set the
meat in the midst.
                  They use either Silver-plate or Porcelane,Plate. and have no Napkins, in regard they
make use of their forks so neatly, that they never have any occasion to wipe either
their hands or mouths. They drink often, but little at a time, whence it comes their
drinking cups are very small; and whereas they serve up many dishes, they are very
long at meals: but that the guests might not be weary, they give them all manner
of divertisements, as Musick, Plays, tricks of Legerdemain, and Puppet-showes. If
it be a person of quality that is invited, they set up in the Hall where the treatment
is made, several other Tables, on which are all sorts of tame and wild Fowl,
all which are carried away by several servants marching in a file before him,
when he returns home, whither having brought them, they, with great Complements,
oblige him to suffer them to leave at his own house what he had
not consumed at their Masters. The treatments they make for a Governour of a
Province lasts sometimes fifteen days or three weeks, and costs them a years Revenue
who undertake any such thing, what ever their Estates may be. Their
entertainments are commonly in the night, making choice of some time about
the change of the Moon, especially that of March, with which they begin their
year.
                  That day they all spend in merriment, put on their best clothes, hang their houses with
the richest stuffs they have,Their newyears day. cover the streets with Roses and other flowers, adorn their triumphal
Arches with branch'd works, Damask and silk Tapestry, beset with Torches, and
plant before the door a tree so enlightned, that though there were but one in a whole
street, it might give light to the whole quarter. Their Priests are present at these publick
rejoycings, and adde to the solemnities of the day by the Sacrifices they make to
their Gods.
                  Speaking of their civility, I shall here give an accompt of that which they
have particularly for the Embassadours of Forreign Princes,The honour they do Embassadours. for whom the Chineses
have the same veneration and respect, as they might express to their own Masters.
                  They do not look on the occasion of the Embassie, but the quality of the Prince
who sends the Embassadour, who is received at the entrance of the Kingdom,
by the Governour of the first Frontier City, who meets him with all the persons
of Quality within his Government. They suffer him not to set his foot on the
ground; but assoon as he comes out of the Ship, he is put into an Ivory Chair, and
carried by eight men to a house appointed for that purpose, which is furnished at the
Kings charge, and so spacious, that several Embassadours may be lodg'd therein at
the same time without any inconvenience. The next day, the Governour of the
City goes to wait on him, and endeavours to learn of him the occasion of his
Embassie, to be communicated to the Governour of the Province, who
immediately sends to the Embassadour, to desire his Credentials, that he
may dispatch them to the Court, and get thence the Pass-port requisite for the
prosecution of his journey. This Pass-port is upon Parchment, with the Kings
Seal in Gold, which is carried before the Embassadour, with the Credentials written
upon a board, having over head in Golden letters the name of the Prince who
sends him. The Governours of Provinces make provision for his expence by the
way, and when he is come near the Metropolis, there meets him the President of
the Privy-Councel, who receives him in the head of all the Councellors, and most
of the Courtiers, and conducts the Embassadour to his Lodgings, and as he takes
leave of him, he empowers him to create a certain number of Loytias, and to set at
liberty some Condemn'd persons, the number whereof is regulated sutably to the
greatness of the Prince who sends him. They allow him a certain time to repose
himself, and then the same persons, who met him at his entrance, conduct him to his
Audience, which the King gives him as often as he desires it, and is present at all
the Propositions he makes.
                  The entertainments they make at Weddings, are very great, for the Brides Father

gives her no other Portion then what he spends the first day, in treating the relations and
friends of his Son in Law;Their weddings. and the next day, those of the Bride. The Feasting being over,
the Husband delivers to his Wife, in the presence of her kindred, the Portion he promised
her, and she gives it her Father or Mother, as a requital of the pains they had taken
in her Education; so that by this means such as have most Daughters are the happiest,
especially if they be handsom. Maids are married very young, and the Father may
dispose of the Dower given his Daughter, if any necessity oblige him thereto; but if he
keep it, it is due to the Daughter, all the other Children being excluded from having any
benefit thereof.
                  Polygamy is lawful among them,Polygamy lawful. but incest severely forbidden, in a direct line, to infinitie;
and in a collateral, to Sisters and Nieces. The first is the only lawful Wife, the rest
Concubines, insomuch that they do not only not live in the same Lodgings with the first,
but also her eldest Son Inherits as much of the Estate himself, as all the rest put together.
If the first wife have no Son, or having any, if he die before the Father, the eldest by the
other wives succeeds him in his right, and represents the heir apparent of the Family.
                  A man seldom hears of any Adulteries committed among them; for the women are
kept in such restraint, that they are in a manner inaccessible. The Husband hath the same
power, as in other places, to kill the Adulteress and her Gallant, if he take them in the Act:
but in regard it is a self-ended and self-conceited Nation, they choose rather to make their
advantage otherwise of such an accident, then defame themselves by a severity, which
saves their reputation only in appearance.
                  The Government of the King,The Government of China Monarchical. the Emperour of China, is Monarchical, and it may be
said to be in some respect despotical, in as much as the Soveraign is so absolute, that no Law
checks his Power; and yet his Government is so mild, that there is not any Democracy, where
the Inhabitants are less burthen'd then they are in China. Nothing is more destructive
to a State, and more obliges Princes to have recourse to extraordinary wayes, to the cost
of their Subjects,Offensive Warr become defensive by a Fundamental Law. then War. Whence it comes, that the Kings of China, considering that
no forreign War can be carried on but at the cost of the people, and that by that means
the foundations of a House are dig'd up to cover the roof of it, have made it a Fundamental
Law, that no War should be made to extend the Frontiers of the Kingdoms. And to
the end, their Subjects may give forreigners no occasion of making any War against their
Countrey, they are forbidden upon pain of Death to go out of it, without express permission
from the Prince, or Governour of the Frontiers.
                  They call their Emperour Tie'neu,Their King called Son of Heaven. that is, Son of Heaven, or Son of God; not that they
believe him descended from Heaven, but being the chiefest of men, they look on him as a
gift of Heaven, and a person dear to the Gods. He assumes to himself the quality of Hoang,
which signifies Emperour of dirt or earth, so to be distinguished, from Xanhi, who
is the great Emperour of the Universe. They say, that he who first took the name of
Hoangthir lived many ages before the birth of our Saviour, and that his successours were
desirous to continue the same name, as they did who succeeded Iulius Caesar in the Empire.
                  That dignity is hereditary in the Family of him who now Reigns,The Crown hereditary. so as that the eldest
Son only succeeds him, the younger brothers being wholly excluded, who yet have the
Title of King, and a Royal retinue, with some City of their demean, where they are lodg'd
and treated as Kings, but have so little Authority, that the Governour who hath it wholly
himself, suffers them not so much as to go out of the City, nay, lets them have their
allowance but quarterly, lest having it paid in altogether, they might employ it in making
friends, to the disturbance of the Publick.
                  The Councel of State consists of twelve Councellours and a President,The Councel of State. who next the
King, hath most Authority. Besides this, there are in the City of Xuntien six other Councellours,
to wit, one for the administration of Justice, which they call Lyp'u. The second,
for the Revenue, which they call Hup'u. The third, for Ceremonies, which are essential
in that Kingdom, and is also called Lyp'u. The fourth for Military Affairs, and is called
Pingp'u. The fifth for publick Structures, called Cungp'u. And the sixth for criminal
affairs, called Hingp'u. The Councellours employed in these Counsels, deliberate about
those things whereof they are to take Cognizance, and come to some resolution; but
they neither publish nor execute any thing without the Emperours express permission, who
reserves the decision thereof to himself, as indeed he doth that of all other affairs of
the Kingdom.
                  
                     
Once in three years he sends Visitors into all the Provinces, who particularly inquire into
the lives and actions of the Governours, and the state of the Provinces; whereof
they make him a faithful report; and by this means he perfectly knows what is done all
over the Kingdom, though he never stirs out of his place.
                  The members of that Councel of State which they call Colao,Astrology requisue in Councellors of State. or Caisiang, that is, Auxiliary
Governours, or Ministers of State, are all Philosophers, and most of them well skil'd
in Astrology, inasmuch as it is expected they should fore-see the Events of things, not
only by the help of civil Prudence, but also by the course of the Stars, which they think
more infallible, then those of reason grounded on experience. The President of this
Councel, and in his absence, the most ancient Councellour, reports to the King the debates
of the Councel, speaking to him on his knees, and looking down to the ground,
never lifting up his eyes, though the audience should last two hours.
                  All the Provinces of China have a Viceroy,Viceroys & Governours whom they call Comon, only Peking and
Nanking excepted, which are Royal Provinces, and have only Governours, whom they
call Insuanto's, and are as King's Lieutenants, inasmuch as they have the chief Authority
in the Province next the Viceroy, yet each within his own jurisdiction, which extends
only over the great Cities, where they reside, and the lesser ones which depend on them.
These last have also their Governours, whom they call Tutuam, and the Portuguez, Mandorines.
                  They call him who is receiver of the King's Revenue in a Province,Other Officers of Provinces. Ponchasi; him who
commands the Soldiery thereof, Toloc; The President for the Administration of Justice,
Anchasi, and the chief of a Councel of War Aytao. All these Officers have their several
Counsels, who all meet in the Vice-roys Palace, who takes Cognizance of all Affairs
passed therein; and if they be of importance, he sends an Express to give notice thereof
to the President of the Councel of State.
                  The most eminent persons next the President,Officers of the Crown. whom they call Colao, are the Cautoc,
that is, the chief Standard-bearer; the Pochin, or receiver of the Kings Revenue; the
Pochinsy, or Lord-keeper of the Great-Seal; and the Autzat, who is the chief Judge
of the City.
                  Under this last,
                        
                      there are three Lieutenants, whereof one is called Hutay, another, Tzi,
and the third, Toutoy, who sit in Judgment once a week at their own houses, and appoint
Commissioners, who have their setled quarters, consisting each of a thousand .
This is particularly observable, that the Commissioner hath no Authority in
the street where he lives, lest he should be byassed in his Judgment by any  on
of neighbour-hood, whence it also comes, that no man is made Vice-roy, 
Judge in his own Country, but he is sent to remote Provinces, where he hath no relations.
                  The Officers are changed every three years, and from the day of their departure from
Court, or the place of their ordinary Habitation, the King defrayes all their Charges,
leaving it to their choice, whether they will take their allowance in provision or mony.
While they continue in their employment, they are lodg'd and treated at the Kings
charge, and there are lodg'd neer the Judges in the same house, the Clerks, Door-keepers,
and all the other Officers belonging to their charge, who are also maintain'd and paid
by the King, that they may take no bribes or gratifications from the parties.
                  They are so circumspect in all their proceedings,Debtors  treated. that there is no Judge but so strictly
examines all particulars, as not to fear any reproach of neglect. Debtours are treated
with so great rigour, that such as are not able to satisfie their Creditors, had rather be
sold to them then endure the cruel fustigations, in the middest whereof, some, who are of
a more delicate Constitution, many times expire.
                  The course taken for the discovery of Crimes,An admirable order. and to prevent several other disorders, is
admirable. The Judges coming to the place of their residence, cause a List to be taken of
all the houses within their jurisdiction, and having distributed them into Decads, they
set a bill on every tenth house, injoyning the Inhabitants to discover such of their Decad as
they know hath committed any crimes, upon pain of being responsible for the same themselves;
as also to give notice of such of their Decad, as remove from their houses, or intend
any great journey, that they may be oblig'd to pay their debts, before they leave the quarter.
                  They have no mercy on Criminals, yet is there not any person Executed, till the crime
be made so apparent, that the criminal can alledge nothing for himself. They endeavour
to get out the truth by fair means, and never order any to be tortured, but upon very
great presumptions; but then they do it cruelly.
                  They put their fingers between two sticks,Their Totures. two fingers broad and better, through the ends
whereof they draw a strong pack-thred, which they bind so hard, that they break the
bones, and make the nailes come off. Another torture they have is, to put the feet between

two boards, much after the same manner, as in some parts of Europe, they put the Leggs
into boots full of hot oyle, save that, there the feet are tormented, and here the leggs.
                  Every great City hath several Prisons,Prisons. which are very strictly kept, but have belonging
to them Courts, Gardens, Ponds, and Walks for the divertisement of such as are detained
there for slight offences. They have also drinking-houses, for the convenience of the Prisoners,
and Shops, wherein are sold such things as the Prisoners make, in order to their
better subsistance.
                  The Sentence of death is not executed till the King hath confirmed it; nay, even that
had, it is done with so many Ceremonies, that unless the heynousness of the Crime cry for
Vengeance very loud, there are more Condemn'd persons languish in the Prisons, then die
by the hand of the Executioner. For there is no Execution, but in presence of the chief
Judge of the Province, or Visitor, who being come to the place, calls for the Indictments
of such as stand condemned to die, and examine them, and thereupon either confirms or
repeals the sentence of the ordinary Judge. Of those whose Sentence is confirm'd, he
takes fifty of the greatest offenders, and orders the Goaler to prepare them for their execution.
Yet are they not brought out of the Prison, till they are once more examined;
and if they can alledge any receivable excuse, they are shut up again, and then they discharge
the great Guns, to shew that they are going to Execution. But before they are
brought to the place of punishment, they are examined once more, and the Judge presses
them to think of themselves, and to find out some pretence that might oblige him to defer
it. If they have nothing to alledge, he orders so many Guns to be fired, as there are
persons to be executed. Being come to the place of execution, they are set upon heaps of
Ashes, where they have somewhat given them to eat, and then begins the last examination:
but if, that over, they have no excuse, the Guns are discharged the third time, and the
execution is compleated.
                  Their punishments are,Their punishments. to hang up, to empale, to burn; but this last is only for such as
are guilty of high Treason.
                  They have a particular punishment for Thieves.That of Thieves. For as they detest Theft above all
Crimes, so is its punishment attended with more infamy then the others. They lay the
Malefactor upon his belly, with his hands ti'd behind him, and in that posture, two executioners
beat him with all their might upon the calf of the Leg, with great Canes
moystned in water, which is so painful a chastisement, that most of the wretches die under
their hands. The Judges are present at these executions; but that they may not be
moved to compassion, which the Condemned would never be the better for, they spend
their time in gaming and drinking, and stop their ears against their cries.
                  But that Governours and Judges may not abuse their power,The Visitors they are obliged not only
to give an account of their actions, at the expiration of their Commissions, before
Judges appointed for that purpose, whom they call Chenes; but also the King sends into
the Provinces a Visitor, whom they call Leaches. He goes into the Province incognito,
takes an exact and secret information of the Actions of the Officers, and having gone
round the Province, comes up near the Metropolis of it, towards the time that all the
Officers of the Province meet there, which is once a month; he sends to the Viceroy and
the Assembly to open the Gate to him, that he may come and acquaint them with the
King's pleasure. This message discovers his quality, and yet when he goes into the
Assembly, he hath his Commission carried open before him; and assoon as it is read, the
Viceroy comes out of his place, and the other Judges out of their seats, and do reverence
to the Visitor, who having taken the Viceroys place, commends those who have done
their duty, and tells them, he shall not fail to report the same to his Majesty.
                  Then turning to those whom he hath found Delinquent, he reproves them, deprives
them of the Marks of Magistracy, which are the Hat and Girdle, suspends, or absolutely
dispossesses them of their charges, and puts others into them. It is in his power
to advance to the greatest dignities such as he judges capable thereof, to brand with infamy
those who have neglected their duty, nay, to punish them, but not with death; inasmuch
as the Emperour only is Master of the lives of his Subjects.
                  As to the Religion of the Chineses,The Religion of the chineses. it may be said to be Pagan, though from the figure
of one of their principal Divinities, it might be imagined that they have heretofore had
some apprehensions of Christianity, and some would infer, that three Heads, which they
make coming out of the Body of one of their Idols, represent the blessed Trinity, which
makes the first and greatest Mistery of Christian Religion. They adde hereto, that
St. Thomas the Apostle Preached the Gospel in China, and that there are some Pictures to
be found there, wherein may be seen men dressed and shaped as the Apostles are painted
among us, and that some have seen their Images representing the blessed Virgin, holding

the Saviour of the World in her Armes. But the se are only chimerical imaginations, since
that, setting aside the establishments which the Portuguez and Spaniards have made there
some years since, there is not the least track to be seen of the Ancient Christian Religion.
                  They affirm that all things,Their Divinities. visible and invisible, were made by Heaven. And this
they express by the first Letter of their Alphabet. They also believe that the Heaven
governs the Universe by a Vicegerent, whom they call Laocon Tzautey. For him it is they
have the greatest veneration next the Sun, and say, it is an eternal Spirit, who was not
created. They have the same opinion of another Divinity, whom they call Cansay, and
to whom they Attribute an absolute power over all Sublunary things. To these three
Spirits, they add three principal Ministers, whom they call Tanquam, Teiquam, and Tzuiquam,
whereof the first presides over the Air, and makes it rain; another, over the generation
of Men and other Animals, and the production of Fruits; and the third hath
the government of the Sea. They also canonize some, whose lives have been eminent
for Sanctity, or otherwise, and call them Pausaos, that is, Saints; but they do not render
them the same Honours they do the Gods before mentioned, or yet the three following
Saints, who are also in great veneration among them.
                  The first they call Sichia,
                         China Saints. who came into China out of the Kingdom of Toungking, and
is Founder of all the Religious Orders of both Sexes, which are at present in the Kingdom,
and whereof there are very great numbers, living in perpetual celebate, and inhabiting
in Monasteries.
                  The second is called Quanina,The Fabl of Quanina a Female Saint, and, as they affirm, was the third Daughter
of King Tzonton, who having married his two elder Daughters, would also have this
embrace the same kind of life. But this Princess having made a Vow of Chastity, would
not hear of Marriage, and upon that account lost her Fathers favour, who shut her up in
a place, where her employment was, to carry Wood and Water, and to weed a great
Garden whereof she had the keeping. They have great Legends of the Life of this Saint,
and relate several stories of her; among others, that the Apes of the neighbouring Forrest
came thither, and carried Water for her; that the Birds weeded the Garden for her;
and that several other Creatures brought the wood she was obliged to fetch. The Father
imagining this was done by his Daughter's witchcraft, caused the house to be fired,
which the Princess seeing, and considering that it was for her sake, would have cut her
own throat, with a string of hair; but she immediately found the fire put out by a
great shower which then fell, whereupon she went thence and retired into the Deserts of
the neighbouring Mountain. The King's impiety was punished with the Leprosie, which
spread it self over all his body, wherein it bred so many Worms, that he had been devoured
by them, if the Daughter, upon notice given her of it by a voice from Heaven,
had not relieved him. The misery he endured had raised in him a great remorse of Conscience;
so that finding himself recovered by his Daughter's intercession, he fell down
on his knees before her, begg'd her pardon for what was past, and would have adored
her, but she refused those honours: yet so as that, it not being in her power to avoid
them, she set an Idol before her, and returned to the Desert, whence she came only to
cure her Father. She dyed there, and, by an extraordinary austerity of life, acquired so
great a reputation of sanctity, that they still honour her with a Religious worship, invocate
her, and beg her intercession for the remission of sins.
                  They have yet a third Saint,The  of Neoma. of the same Sex, whom they call Neoma; and affirm,
she was a Daughter of a Prince of the City of Yocheu, in the Province of Huquang.
The aversion she had conceived against Marriage, obliged her to retire into the Island of
Ingoa, where they say she wrought many Miracles. They relate, among others, that a
Lord named Compo, having received orders from the King to go along with a Fleet
which lay ready to set sail, it was not in the power of the Mariners to weigh the Anchors.
Compo was so surprised at the accident, that he would needs see himself what might be
the cause of it. He found Neoma sitting on the Anchor belonging to the Admiral. He
told her, the King had commanded him to go and make a War in one of the neighbouring
Provinces, and entreated her not to oppose his Design. She made answer, that she
would contribute to his gaining the Victory he promised himself in that Expedition, if he
would take her along with him: which he was the more inclinable to do, in regard he
already knew her by reputation. Accordingly, the Army was no sooner come in sight of
the Enemies Countrey, but she dissolved the Charm, whereby the Inhabitants had made
all the Sea look as if it had been on fire, and forced the Enemies to render themselves
up at mercy. Compo thought at first it had been an illusion; whereupon he would have
a stronger assurance of Neoma's power, and told her; he should make no further question

of her sanctity, if she could make the stick he had in his hand to flourish, and wax green
again; which she did. Compo planted his stick at the stern of his Ship, and openly acknowledged,
that all the success of his Arms was to be attributed to Neoma; and thence
it comes, they say, that the Chineses set this Neoma at the Sterns of their Ships, and make
their Addresses to her, for the prosperity of their Voyages.
                  They express little Devotion and respect for their Idol's.The Chineses use incntations For being extreamly addicted
to consult Incantations and Charms, in all their affairs of great Importance, in so
much that they will not undertake a journey, nor marry, nor indeed do any business of consequence,
till they have consulted them. If they prove not according to their expectations,
they raile at their Gods, call them Dogs, and reproach them with all baseness. But
when their indignation is a little over, they change their reproaches into flattery and
kindness, ask them pardon, promise them what they least intend to perform, and then
return to their Incantations again. If they are otherwise answered then before, they flatter
and praise their Gods; but if they are still threatned with misfortune, they give them
both ill words and blows, throw them down, tread upon them, beat them, drag them
into the dirt, burn them with a candle, or whip them, till the Spell favours them, and
then they offer to them Ducks, Geese, Poultry, boild Rice, &c. Their great Sacrifices
consist of offering to their Gods the head of a boil'd Hog, adorn'd with flowers and ,
and a Jar of Wine.
                  Their way of Incantation is performed by two pieces of Wood,How they do it. about the bigness of a
Wall-nut, whereof one side is flat, the other round, like a half bowl. These they cast upon
the ground, and if it happen that both, or one fall so as that the round side be downwards,
they take it for a very ill omen; but they cast them so often, that they must at
last fall as they would have them. Another way they have, and that is, by casting into
a Pot several pieces of Wood, each whereof hath a certain Character upon it, and they
have them drawn out by a Child; and as they are taken out, they turn over a Book, till
they come to a Page that begins with the Character drawn out of the Pot, and they accommodate
the words they find in the Page, to the thing whereof they would know the
event by the said drawing out of the Characters.
                  They also invoke the Devil;They invoke the Devil. and the gestures of those who are employed in these Invocations
are such, as a man would say they were really possessed; nay there have been
some Christians so simple as to believe it.
                  The Chineses believe,Their belif concerning the Creation. that the Heavens, the Earth, and Water, have been from all eternity,
but that heretofore they were so confounded together, that it must be the work of a
Divinity to reduce them into order. They call the God who did this, Tayn, and affirm
that, in the beginning, he, of nothing, created a man whom he called Panzon, and a woman,
whom he namen Panzona; That Panzon, in like manner, of nothing, created another
man, named Tanhom, and his thirteen brethren, and that this Tanhom was so learned,
that he gave names to all things that were Created: That Tanhom and his brethren had
diverse Children, but particularly that the second, whom they call Teyencom, had twelve
sons, and that his eldest, whose name was Tubucom, had nine: That their Race hath
lived upon the Earth above ninety thousand years; but that, at last, Tayn kill'd all the
Males for their Rebellion: That at that time, the heaven fell, but that Tayn raised it again,
and created another man, named Lotzitzen, who had two horns in his forehead, ou of
which came forth a pleasant scent, from whence were begotten males and females, and
that all now alive are descended from Lotzitzan, who, as they affirm, lived nine hundred
years: That the Heaven begot also another man, named Atzion, by a very extraordinary
production, inasmuch as his Mother, whom they call Lutim, was got with child,
by looking on the head of the Lyon in the Zodiack, and that she was brought to bed in
the City of Tengcheu, in the Province of Xantung: That many Ages afterwards, one
named Vsao taught Architecture, and began to build houses, and make cloathes: That
Huntzui, his successor, found out fire, and taught people how to boil and roast meat, as
also how to buy, and sell, and make contracts: That a woman named Hautzibon, had conceived,
by setting her foot in the step of a man, and brought forth Ocheutey, who first
made marriages, and invented several musical instruments: That Ezonlom, his Son, was
the first Teacher of Medicine and Judiciary Astrology, and the first who made use of the
Plough and the Spade. They affirm also, that he was wont to feed on a Sallad of seven
of the most venemous Herbs could be found, and that instead of receiving any harm thereby,
it kept him alive four hundred years, and that he left a son, from whom are descended
all the ancient Kings of China.
                  They believe the Immortality of the Soul,They believe the Immortality of the Soul. and affirm that the Heaven communicates its
Eternity thereto, and that, after this Life, it shall enjoy eternal bliss, or be eternally tormented,
according to the good or evil done in this World,
                  
                     
They believe also a kind of Purgatory, and that there is a certain place, where Souls are
to be cleansed from the impurities they derived from the bodies which they had informed;
and that, as to this particular, the Suffrages of their Friends and Relations may procure
them some refreshment. Whence it comes, that, in August, they have a Day appointed
for Prayers and supplications to be made for the Deceased: but instead of performing
these Ceremonies in their Pagodes, they do them in the private Houses of such as are inclined
to this kind of Devotion: To that end, three of their Religious men go to the House
appointed, and exhort the Family to make the Prayers requisite for the purging of those
sins which obstruct the Beatitude of their deceased Relations. Of these three Religious
men, one carries a little Drum; another certain Images; and the third, a small Bell.
Having set the Images upon the Altar, they Incense them, while in the mean time some
others are busied in setting, on five or six Tables, certain Dishes of Meat, for the Saints
and Souls of the Deceased, and that done, they fall a-dancing, and singing certain Hymns,
which the younger of the Religious men writes down on Paper, and afterwards lays on the
Altar. Assoon as he is returned to his place, they fall a-singing again, till such time as
he who says the Service strikes his Image against the Table, whereto the others answer
with their heads, and that done, they burn the Images before the Altar. Having spent the
night in this kind of Devotion, which is not begun till after Sun set, the Religious men, and
those of the House make good chear with what they find on the Tables, and had been set
there for the spirits of the other World: and thus they procure the purgation of the
Souls departed.
                  Most of them do also believe the Transmigration of Souls,And Metempsychosis. but few speak of it with any
rational ground.
                  They have four Orders of Religious men, whereof some are clad in black, some in
white,Their Religious men and some in a dark grey. Every Order hath its General, whom they call Tricon,
who lives in the City of Xuntien. He hath under him Provincials, who make Visitations
within their several Jurisdictions, to see that there be an observance of Discipline, and
that there be no remission of the rigour required by the Rules of the Order. These
have also the nomination of Superiours and Guardians in the several Monasteries. The
General continues in that dignity as long as he lives, and when he dies, the King names
his successour, making choice of him among those who are most deserving. He is cloth'd
in Silk, but of the same colour as is worn by the Religious men of the Order, and never
goes out of his own house, without a retinue of four Religious men, who carry him in
an Ivory Chair, upon their shoulders. He hath a particular Seal for such affairs as concern
his Order, and his Religious men never speak to him but on their knees. The King allows
him what may keep a plentiful house, and contributes also to the subsistance of the Monks
in the Monasteries; and if they want any thing, it is supplied by the liberality of private
persons. The Religious men are all clad in serge, and all after the same fashion, save that
they are distinguished by the colour.Vse Beads. They all shave their heads and beards. They use
beads, and say their Mattens and other Offices, much after the same manner as our Monks
in Europe do. Those who enter into the Monastery make a feast for all the Monks; but
the eldest Son of a Family is not permitted to take the habit; in regard the Laws of the
Kingdom forbid it, and would have him to be the comfort and support of the weak and
decrepit age of his Father. Their vows are not indispensable, but they may quit the Monastery,
and marry.
                  The Chineses observe at their Funerals the following Ceremonies.Funeral Ceremonies. Assoon as any person
is deceased, they wash the body, put about him his best cloathes well perfum'd, and set
him in the biggest Chair they can find in the house: That done, the Wife, Children,
Brothers, Sisters, and afterwards all the Relations, kneel down before him, and take their
leave of him. That Ceremony over, they put him into a Coffin of sweet-wood well
closed, and set him upon a Table, or two tressels, and they cover him with a Hearsecloath,
reaching down to the ground, upon which they draw the Picture of the deceased.
They leave him in that posture fifteen days, during which time, in some other Chamber
or Hall, there stand constantly set on a Table, Wine, Fruit, and two wax Torches lighted,
for the Priests, who spend the night there in singing and praying, according to their
way; but especially in making divers inchantmets against the evill Spirits, and in burning
several Images and fastning others to the Hearse-cloath, which covers the Coffin,
which Images they ever and anon move with their hands, thinking they by that means
force the Soul to Heaven. The fifteen days being over, the body is carryed into the
Country, where the Priests interr it, and commonly plant a Pine-tree neer the Sepulchre;
whence it comes, that they have a particular venration for that Tree.
                  
                     
Their mourning is austere enough. Sons continue it for a whole year, and sometimes
two,Their mourning. during which time, they are clad in a course cloth, cover their heads with
a Hat of the same, and tie about their upper Garment with a cord. Nay, some quit
the publick employments they have, with the Kings consent, and ever after live privately.
Remote kindred go in mourning for some months; and friends put it not off
till the body be laid in the ground.
                  From what we said before concerning the Wall which divides China,The present State of China. from Tartary, it
may well be inferr'd that the Chineses have a dreadful enemy beyond it. It must indeed
be acknowledged, that though we have not any Author that hath given a pertinent account
of the Eastern part of Tartary, which reaches from little Tartary, and the Kingdom
of Cascar, to the Eastern Sea, and the Streights of Anian above Iapan, yet have
we it for certain, that out of those parts, and the Kingdoms of Samahania, Taniulth,
Niuche, Niulhan, &c. came those Nations who over-ran several Provinces of Euope, and
in a manner all Asia, under Tamerlaine; and under other Chiefs, possessed themselves of
the Kingdom of China.
                  For in the year 1206,The Tartars possessed of China. the Tartars, whom the Chineses called Tata, because they do
not pronounce the Letter R. entred China with a powerful Army, and after a War of
seventy two years became Masters of it, forc'd thence the Princes of the house of Sunga,
which then Reign'd, and were peaceably possest of the whole Countrey, for the space
of near seventy years; till a certain Priest's servant named Chu, considering that the savageness
of the Tartars was much abated by the delights of China, undertook a War
against them,And forced thence. and forc'd them out of China in the year, 1368. The aversion the Chineses
had to be governed by a forreign power soon prevail'd with them to become subject
to Chu, who assumed the quality of Hugnus, that is, Great Warriour; and was the first
of the Royal Family of Teiming,The origine of the Royal house of Teyming. which reign'd in China even to our days.
                  Chu not thinking it enough to have forced the Tartars out of the Kingdom of Chia,
entred with an Army into that of Niuche, whither the Tartars were retreated, and forc'd
them to acknowledge the Soveraignty of the Emperour of China, and to pay him Tribute.
                  The Tartars divided themselves into seven Colonies, which warred one against the
other, till they were reduced into one State, under the name of the Kingdom of Niuche,
about the year 1600.
                  About that time Raigned in China,The beginning of the Tartarian War. Vanlie, who had succeeded his Father in the Empire,
in the year 1573. and lived in an absolute peace, when the Governours of the
Frontiers, conceiving some jealousie at the great powerfulness of the Tartars, would
needs hinder their Merchants from trading into China, opposed the match, which the
King of Nuche would have made between his Daughter, and the King of Tanyu, took
him and killed him. The King of Nyuche's son, desirous to revenge his Fathers Death,
raised an Army, passed over the great wall, entred China in the year 1616. and took
the City of Gayven, whence he writ, in very respectful terms, to Vanlie, who was then
living, and represented to him the injury had been done him by the Governours of the
Frontiers, proffering to deliver up the City, and go out of the Kingdom upon condition
his complaints might be heard, and Justice done him. Vanlie, instead of reflecting
on the Justice of this demand, returned the business to the Councel of State, where it
was not thought fit so much as to answer his Letters. The Tartar, on the other side,
was so incensed at this slighting of his Proposals, that he vowed to sacrfice two hundred
Thousand Chineses to the Manes of his Father.
                  Accordingly,Take the Metropolis of Leatung having taken the City of Leaoyang by assault, though the Metropolis of
the Province of Leaotung, he put all the Chineses to death. He afterwards took the
City of Quanning, and entred with his Army into the Province of Peking. But fearing
to be shut up there by the Chineses, who had got a vast Army together, he returned
to Leaoyang, where he caused new Fortifications to be made, and there assumed
the quality of Thienming, and was called Emperour of China, though he were possessed
only of Leaotung; which is so inconsiderable a place, as that it is not so much as numbred
among the Provinces of that Kingdom.
                  This happened in the year 1618. The year following, 1619. the Chineses, who had
got together an Army of six hundred thousand fighting men, gave battel to the Tartars;
but they were defeated, and lost, besides the fifty thousand men kill'd upon the place,
most of their best Commanders. Upon this Victory, the Tartars entred the Province of
Peking, where they took and ransack'd all; ny would have set upon the City of Xuntien,
where the Emperour was then in person, had they not been prevented by the Garrison,
which consisted of tweny thousand men.
                  Amidst these distractions, Vanlie dies, in the year 1620. Tayohang, his Son, succeeded

him; but he reigning only four moneths, left the Scepter to Thienki, who proved so fortunate,Vanlie dies and succeeded by Tayohang He by Thienki.
as to force away the Tartars, not only out of the Cities they had taken in Peking, but
also out of Leaotung, and all the Province of Leaoyang, where their cruelties had made
their Government very odious and burthensom. But he injoyed not long the fruits of
that Victory. For the Tartar having set all things in order at home, sent into China an
Army of eighty thousand Horse, which he followed with another Body, and retook the
City of Leaoyang by assault,Wh forces way the Tartars. there having been before an Engagement between them,
wherein both sides had fought very resolutely, for the space of fourty hours.
                  There were killed in the said Engagement 20000. of the Tartars,But they re-enter Leaotung. who were so startled
at that resistance, that having fighting work elsewhere, cut them out by Maovenlung, General
of the Chinese Army, even in Leaotung, things continued in that posture till the year
1625.
                  In the said year 1625. they assaulted the City of Ningiven, which the Chineses had fortified,
but were forc'd back, with the loss of ten thousand men, and among others the King
of Tartary's Son,Take the Isle of Thaoyuen who to express his resentment of that misfortune, pass'd over with his
Army into the Island of Thaoyven, where the Tartars put all the Garrison to the Sword,
but made no further progress.
                  In the year 1627. died Thienki,The Kings of China, and Tartary dye. Emperour of China, and Thienning, King of the Tartars.
The former was succeeded by Zungchini his Brother; the other, by Thienzung, his Son,
who taking a different course from his Fathers, and changing his cruelty into mildness, endeavoured
by that means to prevail with the Chineses, whom he could not overcome by
force. Yet was it not either the prudence of Thienzung, or the courage of the Tartars,
but the disloyalty of the Chineses, and the treachery of their Commanders, which proved
the final ruine of the Kingdom.
                  For Zunchini,The Chineses betray their Country. perceiving that the Army which he had sent into Corea had been defeated,
though the Tartars had lost on their side above fifty thousand men, and that he had
some ground to fear a Civil War, bestowed the command of an Army on one named Yuen,
empowring him withall to make a peace with the Tartars. This Traytor having received
money from the Enemy, took off Maovenlung by poyson, and concluded so disadvantagious
a Treaty with them, that the Emperour refused to ratifie it. This pretended affront proved
the destruction of Yuen, who still continued his intelligence with the Tartars; but
Zungchini, having discovered his Treachery, ordered him to be cut in pieces, which was
done in the year 1630.
                  Ever after that time,Thienzung King of Tartary dies. the Tartars only made incursions into the neighbouring Provinces:
but Thienzung, King of Tartary, dying in the year 1636. Zungte, his Son, (who had been
brought up in his infancy in China, where the manner of living of that Country had been
instill'd into him) succeeded him, and by his liberality corrupted most of the Governours
and Chinese Commanders, who thereupon sided with him; especially when they saw that
the distractions which then shook the State, wherein there were eight Armies of Tories,
or common Rogues, at the same time, were absolutely contrary to the preservation of the
Kingdom.
                  These Armies were disposed, in the year 1641. under two Generals, whereof one was
called Licungzo, the other Chanchienchung, who divided the Provinces between them, so
as that the former had the command in Xensi and Honan, and the other, in Suchuen and
Huquang. Licungzo having taken in the chief Cities of these two Provinces, assumed
the quality of King, and would be called Xunuang, that is, the fortunate King; and hoping
to become Master of the whole Empire, would needs have the Title of Emperour,
and that his Family should have the name of Thienxun, that is, obedient to Heaven.
And indeed Heaven seem'd to comply with his perfidiousness, by the intrigues which in
the mean time were carried on at Court, where all the Grandees were divided into Factions,
through the means of a Favourite, of whom we shall here take occasion to say somewhat.
                  Under the Reign of Thienki, there was, at Court, an Eunuch, named Guei: who was so
much in favour with the Emperour, that the latter call'd the other Father. This man,
who had been raised to that greatness, in a manner from the Dunghill, abused his Authority,
and made his Ministry odious, by the ill treatment they received from him, who had
too much courage to become his Courtiers and Adorers. He was so mpudent, as to declare
himself against the Prince, who was looked upon as Heir apparent to the Crown, in
as much as Thienki had no Children, and to oppose his establishment after the Emperours
death. This Prince was Zungchini, whom we spoke of before, and of whom we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter. He prov'd so fortunate as to elude the Artifices of the Eunuch,
and got the Crown on his Head, without much contestation, but he had not so

much power as to smother the Factions, into which the Court was divided by the intrigues
of the Favourite. As soon as he came to the Crown, he gave the Eunuch a Commission,
very honourable in appearance, but in effect very fatal to him; for he commanded
him to go and visit the Sepulchres of his Ancestors, and to give order there should be nothing
amiss about them: but as soon as he was gone from Peking, Zunchini sent after him
a Messenger, who presented him with a gilt Box, wherein there was a Silken Halter, and
told him, that the Emperour had commanded him to bring an account of his death. But
this Execution reconciled not those who had engaged either for or against him, during his
life, and the aversion which the Emperour openly expressed towards his Abettors, only
augmented the number of discontented and treacherous persons, which were on both sides;
in so much that most of the Grandees, minding only their private Affairs, they either neglected
sending the relief which the Governours of the Provinces required against the Tartars,
or maliciously dissembled the need they stood in thereof: and by that means, the Rebels
had time to make sure work on their side.
                  Lizungzo so well knew how to make his Advantages of these Distractions,Lizungzo enters the Province of Xansi. that, having
settled all things relating to the Province of Xensi, he without any obstruction crossed
the River Hoangh, or Croceus, and entred the Province of Xansi, where he took the great
and rich City of Kiangcheu. The other Cities of the same Province afterwards came in,
save only that of Thaiyuen, which was taken by storm, and plunder'd. The Emperour,
hearing that the Rebels had passed the River Hoangh, and fearing they might beset him in
the City of Xuntien, would have retreated to Nanking; but he was perswaded to the
contrary by his Council, it being the intention of some by that means to keep up the
reputation of his Armes, of others, to deliver him up to Lizungzo; so that he sent against
the Rebels a powerful Army, under the Command of the Colao, or President of
the Council, who prov'd so unfortunate in his business, that, out of despair, he hung himself.
                  Lizungzo,Takes the City of Peking. who had his Correspondents in the City of Peking, or Xuntien, understanding
how things stood at Court, sent some of his people into the City, who, under pretence of
keeping a Tavern, or opening Shops for Mercery, were to make a Rising, when they heard
the Army was advanced near the City. Some affirm, he had corrupted him who had the
Command of the City, and that by his Order he found one of the Gates open, at which
he entred it, in April 1644. and afterwards became Master of the Palace, before the Emperour
had any notice of his coming. The Traitors, who had kept him from hearing of
it, prevented him also from getting away: so that perceiving Lizungzo was possessed of
all the Avenues of the Castle, and thinking it too great a dishonour to submit to the
Commander of a sort of Robbers, he with his own hands kill'd an only Daughter he
had, so to secure her honour, which she could not have kept with her life; and going
into the Garden, he took off one of his Garters, and hung himself at a Plum-tree. The
Colao, the Queen, and some of his Eunuchs, followed his example, and hung themselves
in the same Garden. Zunchini left three Sons, whereof the two youngest had their
Heads cut off, three dayes after the Fathers death, but the eldest vanish'd, and could
not be found, notwithstanding all the diligence Lizungzo used to get some account of
him.
                  I shall forbear giving a relation of all the executions which this barbarous person ordered
in the City, where he put all the Officers to death; only this I cannot omit, that,
among others Persons of Quality, there was an ancient man named Vs, whose Son commanded
the Chinese Army upon the Frontiers of Leaotung. Lizungzo sent order to this
Vs, that he should write to his Son, to this effect, That if he with his Army would acknowledge
him Emperour of China, he would divide Fortunes with him; threatning, if
he did it not,A Chinese calls the Tartarte his relief against the Rebels. to put him to death. The Father writ to Vsanguei, so was his Son called, in
such terms, as he might infer from them what condition he was in: but the Son generously
made him answer, that he could not own him for a Father, who had been unfaithful
to his King; and that if he had so base a Soul as to advise him to be a Traitor, he, for his
part, had one so loyal, as to persist in the resolution he had taken, rather to die, then obey a
Highway-man. Whereupon Vsanguei immediately sent to the Tartars, to desire them to
joyn, and march along with him against that Usurper. The Tartar thought it not amiss
to make his advantage of the opportunity he then had, to get into the Heart of the Kingdom,
and so marched with his Forces against Lizungzo.
                  This lewd Villain,Lizungzo flies who had put so many innocent persons to death, trembled at the first
notice he received of the March of the Tartars, left the City of Xuntien, and retreats
into the Province of Xensi, intending to establish the Seat of his pretended Empire at
the City of Sigan. The Tartars pursued him to the River Croceus, or Hoangh, defeated

part of the Rear-guard, and had the Plunder of some part of the Baggage, in which were
all the Riches which the Emperours of China, of the House of Tayming, had been two
hundred and eighty years getting together.
                  The Tartars would not cross the River, as well because they would secure the Conquest
of the Province of Peking, as for that they were without any Prince, ever since the death
of Zungte, who died when the Army began to march out of the Province of Leaotung.
He had left only one Son, about six years of age, whom he had recommended to the tuition
of the eldest of his three Brethren, who proved so faithful to his trust, that the Tartars
gave him the name of Amaban, that is, Father-King.
                  Vsanguei,The Tartars will not go out of China. finding the Province of Peking and the Metropolis thereof deliver'd of those
Robbers, would have requited the service the Tartars had done China, and obliged the Forreigners
to leave the Kingdom. But he who commanded the Tartarian Army told him,
that it was too soon to talk of any such thing as yet; that Lizungzo was still alive, and
might re-enter Peking, that there was a necessity of ruining him, so as that it should be
impossible for him to recover himself; and that Vsanguei should go himself with his Army,
and some of the Tartarian Force, against the Usurper, and put the Rebels to an absolute
Defeat.
                  As soon as the Tartars were intreated by Vsanguei to come into China, they sent to invite
all the other Tartars, from the Eastern Sea to the River Wolga, to come and participate
of their Conquests; in so much that no Colony of them but sent in some Forces, which
coming into China, brought along with them that young Tartar King, the Son of Zungte.
As soon as he was come,And proclaio their King Emperour of China. the Tartars discover'd what their intentions were; for they settled
him upon the Throne, and caused him to be proclaimed Emperour of China, under the Regency
of the eldest of his Uncles. He took the name of Xunchi, and ordered his Family
to be called Taicing; and they say, that young Prince made so sensible a discourse at his
inauguration, as very much startled those who heard it, and expected no such thing from
one so young.
                  The same day that these Ceremonies were performed at Peking,Usanguei made King. they sent away some
Tartarian Regiments, with Orders to establish Vsanguei King, to give him the quality of
Pingsi, that is, Pacifier of the West, and that he should reside in the Province of Xensi.
He was the more inclinable to accept what was proffer'd him since there was no other
choice to make; for as to Lizungzo, it could never be known, what became of that
Villain.
                  Vsanguei's declaring himself satisfied with what had been proffer'd him by the Tartars,
facilitated their Conquest of the Provinces of Peking, Xansi, and Xantung, which
they possessed themselves of in less then a years time, and settled themselves therein, allowing
the Inhabitants their Laws, Magistrates, and manner of life, and reserving only to themselves
military employments, and the defence of places.
                  In the interim, the Southerly Provinces had raised a powerful Army, which they sent to
the Emperours relief: but upon the first news brought them of the reduction of Peking,
and the death of Zungchini,The Southerly Provinces chuse another Emperour. they remanded their Army, with all the Boats, which carried
the yearly Provisions and Contributions to the Court; and hearing of the Invasion of
the Tartars, they proceeded to the election of another Emperour, of the House of Taiming,
whom they called Hungquang, Nephew to Vanlie, and Cousin to Zungehini. This
man began his Reign with a solemn Embassie which he sent to the Tartars, to demand a
Peace, and to proffer them the Northerly Provinces of the Kingdom. Amahan, whom
the Chineses call Amauang, made answer, that the Tartars never received from any one
what they were already possessed of; that if the Chineses had made choice of an Emperour,
it was their business to protect him; and that, for their parts, they would have all or
nothing.
                  During the time of this Negotiation,A Son of Zungchini'. there came into play a Prince, who gave himself
out to be the eldest Son of the Emperour Zungehini, and was acknowledged to be the
same person, by several Grandees of the Court: But Hungquang imprisoned him, with an
intention to have him strangled, to the great dissatisfaction of those who thence took occasion
to revolt:The Tartars enter the Province of Nanking. so that the Tartars made their advantage of him to get into the Province
of Nanking. Hungquang sent against them a powerful Army, but it ran away, without
ever engaging, upon the first sight of the Tartars, getting into the Boats to cross the
River. Upon that defeat, all the Cities of the Province, on this side the River Kiang, submitted,
save only that of Yangcheu, into which Zu Coloa was got with some Forces, who
made a vigorous resistance, but such as prov'd the destruction of the City, which was
burnt, purposely, to bury, in its ashes, their bodies who had been kill'd, for fear of infecting
the Air.
                  
                     
The Metropolis was yet in the power of Hungquan, who kept the Tartars from crossing
the Kiang, by a good Fleet he had under the Command of Hoangchoang, who had already
gaind many advantages over the Tartars, and put them out of all hope of crossing the River,
when he was kill'd with an Arrow by one of his own people, named Thien, who had
been corrupted by the Tartars. This may be said to have been China's fatal blow, since
that upon the Generals death, the Army fled, and the Tartars passing the River, immediately
pursued Hungquang,Hungquang strangled. and having taken him, by the treachery of the said Thien, they sent
him to Peking, where they strangled him in Iune 1644. They also put to death the young
man, who pretended himself Zunchini's Son, whom they found in prison, and with him all
the other Princes of the Royal house of Tayning, that fell into their hands.
                  Most of the Lords,Several Chinese Lords retire to Haneheu. Another Emperour. Who is also strangled. who escaped these defeats, met together in the City of Hangcheu, in
the Province of Chekiang, the greatest of any in the whole Country, with a design to give
the utmost expression they could of their fidelity and courage. They had chosen Emperour
one of the Royal Family, named Louang; but ere he had reign'd three dayes, the
Tartarian Army was come to the Gates of the City; and the Garrison, which was 
much inclined to fight, demanded their pay; so that Louang, out of all hope to prevent
the taking of the City, would preserve it and the Inhabitants, by a voluntary delivery of
himself to the Tartars, who strangled him, and suffered not that noble City to be plundered.
They took in the same Province, the great City of Xoaking, and were likely to
have made a powerful settlement there, had they not been so imprudent, as to oblige the
Chineses to shave themselves: but they found them so resolutely bent on the contrary, that
the Chineses, who had taken the loss of their Country with so much indifference, chose
rather to lose their Lives then their Hair. They beat the Tartars out of the City of
Xoaking,Another Prince in the Province of Chekiang. forc'd them to repass the River C'enthaeng, and no doubt had retaken the City of
Hangcheu, had they had the courage to pursue them. They thought it enough to entrench
themselves on the River side, and own'd the Authority of a Lord of the House of
Tayming, named Lu, who assumed the Quality of Restaurator of the County, and refused
that of the Emperour.
                  About this time,Another in that of Fokien. the Officers and Souldiers, who retired out of the Province of Chekiang
into that of Fokien, chose another Emperour, named Thang, who writ to Lu, that he
should own him for his Soveraign, in regard he was the nearer of Kin to the deceased
Emperour.This division proves the ruine of China. This division brought the Tartars to be absolute Masters of all China: for
these two Princes refusing to joyn their Forces together against the common Enemy,
the Tartars set upon Lu, and forc'd him to retire into the Island of Cheuxan, over
against the City of Ningpo, which had hardly been peopled, had it not been for that
Defeat.
                  They found it no harder matter to conquer the Province of Fokien,The Tartars reduce the Province of Fokien. though it be divided
from those of Quantung, Kiangsi, and Chekiang, by Mountains, which six thousand men
have kept against all the Forces of Tartary. The Emperour himself, who had assum'd the
name of Longuu, that is, warlike Dragon, fled, and was kill'd, as is conceiv'd, by the Tartars,
who pursued him.
                  They had divided their Army into two Bodies, whereof one was got into Fokien, as we
said before; the other had passed through the Provinces of Hungquang and Kiangsi, so
that they met, much about the same time in that of Quantung, where they again divided,
one part being commanded into Peking,The treachery of a Chinese Pirat. the other into the Province of Quangsi. Their
easie conquest of Fokien proceeded, partly from the good success that attended their designs,
where-ever they went, but particularly from the correspondence they held with
Chincilug, who had the command of Longuu's Army in that Country. He had sometime
been an Interpreter, and a kind of Broker, to the Portuguez, Castilians, and Dutch, at Macao,
the Philippine Islands, and that of Fermosa, under the name of Iquon. Giving over
that employment, he turned Pyrat, and by that means became so powerful, that having
obtained, or rather extorted, an Act of Oblivion from the Emperour of China, he forced
him to suffer him to carry on the Trade of the whole Kingdom, keeping the Sea with a
Fleet of above three thousand Vessels. His design was to get himself proclaim'd Emperour
of China; but knowing he should find too much opposition in the inclinations of
the people, as long as there were Princes to be chosen out of the Family of Tayming, he
was not sorry to see it extirpated by the Tartars, with whom he held correspondence, as
we said before. Upon the reduction of the Province of Fokien, they gave him the Title
of King, under the name of Pingnam, that is, Pacifier of the South, treating him highly,
and putting him in hopes, that they would leave him the command of the two Provinces
of Fokien and Quantung. But the Prince, who commanded the Tartarian Army in the
Province, being upon his departure towards the Court, Chincilung, who had left his Fleet

in the Haven of Focheu, desirous to accompany him to the place where he was to take
leave of all the Officers; the Tartar took his advantage of the opportunity, pressed him
to go along to Peking; and finding him unwilling to do it, secured him, and brought him
away by force; and had it not been for his Brothers, who were Masters of the Fleet, the
Tartars would have put him to death.
                  The other Army,An Emperour chosen in Quangsi which was got into the Province of Quangsi, met with so much resistance
there, that it was forced to dislodge thence, and retreat into that of Quantung, into
which the Viceroy and Governour of the Province pursued them; and to give the greater
reputation to their designs, they created an Emperour of the Royal Progeny, who assum'd
the name of Iunglie. After their example, several other Provinces revolted, but all their
attempts only confirmed the settlement of the Tartars, who after the death of Kiang,
Governour of the City of Taitung in the Province of Xansi, who took up Arms against
them in the year 1649. and their reduction of the City of Quangcheu, in the Province of
Quangsi, which was taken on the 24. of November, 1650. have been possess'd of that vast
Country, without any disturbance; rather through the cowardice of the Chineses, then by
the number of their own Souldiery; in as much as it is impossible for any Army, how numerous
soever, to conquer so powerful a State as that of China; if the Inhabitants had
ever so little courage to defend themselves. Xunchi, the Tartarian Emperour of China,
married the daughter of the King of Taayu, in the Western Tartary, in the year of our
Lord, one thousand six hundred forty and nine.
               
            
            
               
               MANDELSLO'S
TRAVELS
INTO THE
INDIES.
               The Third Book.
               WE gave the Reader an account in the precedent Book,1639 how that the
calm, which staid our Ship in a manner in fight of the Island of Ceylon,
occasioned the digression we have made, wherein we have represented
the State of the Indies, even to the utmost extremities of
Asia.
               We continued at the Altitude of Ceylon,FEBRVARY. till the 20. of February, at which time the
North-west-wind oblig'd us to take our course towards South-east. Taking the Latitude
about noon,The Voyage continued. we found we were two minutes beyond the Aequinoctial Line. I asked the
Master of the Ship, what he thought of their opinion, who affirm, that being under the
Line, a man may discover both the Poles: but he made it appear to me, that it was an errour,
and shewed me clearly, that the Artick Pole is not to be seen within six Degrees of
the Line, and that the Artartick cannot be perceiv'd, till a man comes to the eighth degree.
He shew'd me farther, that at eight or ten degrees of the Line, the wind seems to be as
changeable, as it is in our Seas on this side of it, inasmuch as that of the North-west reigns
there six months together; and that of the South-east blows there as constantly for the
other six moneths. So that such as go into the Indies, or come thence, may regulate their
Voyages accordingly.
               In these parts we saw several sorts of Birds,Several sorts of Birds. whereof some were white, and not unlike
our Pidgeons, save that their Tails are longer and narrower. Others were of sundry colours,
and somewhat like wild Ducks. But among others, we saw abundance of those
Birds which the Portuguez call Garayos, or Rabos foreados, which are black and white, as
Mag-pies, but somewhat bigger, and have their Tails divided like a Taylors pair of Shears.
All these Birds live only by the Sea, and feed on a certain flying Fish, which to avoid the
pursuit of the Albocores, Bonitos, and Dorados, that continually prey upon them, fly into
the Air,And Fish. where they can abide no longer then while their wings are moist, and where they
are caught by these Birds; or if, for want of moisture, they fall back into the Sea, they are
devour'd by those Fishes. The Albocores are white all over, and have no Scales, no more
then the Bonitos. The former are much bigger then the latter, and have but one bone in
them, which comes from the Head to the Tail. Some of them are so large, that if we may
credit report, one, between five and six foot long, hath dined sixty Seamen; but the meat
of it being not very good, I conceive they were rather glutted then satisfied. The Dorado,

which the English confound with the Dolphin, is much like a Salmon, but incomparably
more delicate, and hath smaller Scales.
               We also took a certain Fish,Marsoui. which had a mouth like the snout of a Hog; the Portuguez
call it Tonina, and the French Marsouin, a name, which no doubt is deriv'd from the German
word, which signifies a Sea-hog. The Hollanders, in the Relation of their first Voyage,
affirm, that out of curiosity they opened one of them, and that they found within it not
only flesh and fat, and the intrails after the same manner as those of a Hog, but also a young
Pig in the belly of it, which they cast into the Sea. They are seen alwayes many of them
together, and when the Sea is rough, they come near the Vessel, and grunt, as if they desired
shelter against the Storm they perceive coming, and whereof the Sea-men look upon them
as an infallible sign.
               The Sea hath not a more dangerous Fish then those which the Portuguez call Tuberones,Tuberones
the Dutch, Hayes, and the English, Shark. It is a great Fish, and hath much ado to swim;
whence it comes, that many times, when the Sea is clam, it is seen floating above water.
It is never seen, but there are fastened to the head of it seven or eight other Fish, about the
bigness of a Herring, expecting to participate of what he takes. Above all things, they
love mans flesh, and there are many sad examples of it, in Sea-men, who have either lost
arms or other limbs, or have been devoured by them; for their teeth are as sharp and close
as those of a Saw. Their mouth is below the head, so that to take their prey, they lie upon
their backs, and so catch it upwards. That we took had the heart in the head, and
lived a good while after it was taken out. They are not eaten, and are hunted only for
recreation, or to cleanse the Sea of them.
               The Fish which the Portuguez call Pesce puerco, and whereof there is abundance in these
Seas, is no bigger then a Bream, and is so called, only because it grunts like a Pig. There
are also about those parts great store of Tortoises, which lie on their backs, and commonly
sleep upon the water, when the weather is calm. The Sea-men, when they see them in that
posture, get near them, cast out a hook, which fastning in the shells, they draw them into the
Boat. Their meat is as delicate as Veal, and it is one of the greatest refreshments the Seamen
meet with in these great and dangerous Voyages.
               February 21. We were at one degree and twenty minutes of the Line, the weather being
rainy and tempestuous, and continuing so much longer then we expected it should at
that place; for it is so unconstant there, and changes so of a sudden, that many times they
have hardly leisure to take in their Sails, to avoid the violence of the Winds, which the
Portuguez call Travados, that is, Whirlewinds.
               The 23. died one of our Seamen, who having got the Pox at Surat, neglected the taking
of timely Remedies for the cure of it.
               The 24. being Sunday, the President treated all the Officers of the Ship, and among
other dishes, had the Biggel dressed, and some of the Country Fowl, which the Viceroy of
Goa had presented to him.
               The 25. We were surprized by a Calm, which kept us in the same place all that day;
but the night following there rose a Tempest, that put us out of our course, which we
could not well have kept, had that not happened: in regard that having the Sun in the
Zenith, ever since the 22. we could not take the altitude, but only in the night, by the
Stars.
               This inconvenience continued till the fifth of March,MARCH. having had the twenty seventh and
twenty eighth of February, the wind at South-west, which put us in hope, we should soon
have the Manson-wind whereof we stood in need to bring us to the Cape of Good Hope.
But the continual changes of the Wind, and Tempests, which obliged the Sea-men to be
alwayes about the Masts, lest they should be surprized by the Travados, retarded our progress
very much.
               March 5. We began to make our Observations by the Sun, and found we were at eight
degrees, six minutes Latitude. Our Ship was encompassed by a great number of all sorts
of Fish, which seem'd to be our protection against the Whales, by whom they were pursued.
               March 10. We were at ten degrees,Very changeable weather near the Line. fourteen minutes, the Wind at West, which turned
to a Storm that lasted ten hours.
               March 12. and 13. We had a great Storm, accompanied with Lightning and Thunder.
But what we thought most strange, was that, though we were not come to the 13. degree,
yet we found nothing of the ordinary Wind of the season, which is commonly perceived
about the eight or ninth. For the South-wind, which blew constantly, not only retarded
the prosecution of our Voyage, but also forced us so much back Eastward, that we were in
in some fear, we might be constrain'd to return upon the Coast of the Indies.
               
                  
March 15. The Wind changed, and came to the South, and at Night, we had it South-east;
so that not doubting but it was the Manson, we put out all the Sail we could, and
made two Leagues an hour, taking our course South-west. During the time the Wind was
thus fair for us, we saw a great number of Dolphins, which followed our Ship, and we took
as many of them as found us three good Meals.
               March 20. We were surpriz'd by a Calm, which took off much of our courage; in regard
our store of fresh Water being somewhat low, at a time when we knew not what to
hope of our Voyage, we were forced to assign every Man his allowance; and to make it
last the longer, it was resolved, that for some dayes there should be no salt Meat eaten, but
that the Swine, and some other Creatures, whereof, having good store, some had died that
day upon the eating of Mustard-seed, should be kill'd and consum'd.
               Being about this time at sixteen Degrees, we found that the Compass declined thirty
Minutes to the West, and it continued so to the four and twentieth Degree. But when the
Cape of Good Hope is once doubled, the Loadstone draws towards the Earth.
               The 21. While we floated up and down, without so much as a breath of wind, our
Ship took fire, which might have proved to the ruine of us all.
               The Butler, going to remove a Vat which he had filled with Aqus vitae, set it on fire;
whereat he was so startled, that he turned it out about the Cellar, where the fire took in
one of the great Vessels, and was going to set thirty more into a flame, ahd it not been timely
prevented with Coverlets. The Ship was so loaden with all sorts of Gums, and other fat
Drugs, that it would have been impossible to quench it, had there not been a care taken to
smother it, at the beginning.
               After that day, we began to made use of the invention of drawing fresh Water out of the
Sea; but it was fit only to dress Meat withall, in regard it had so untoward a taste, that the
Sea-men would not take it for their ordinary drink.
               March 22. We made a good dayes sail by the help of the Manson, getting above two
Leagues an hour. The same Wind continued the 23. 24. and 25.
               This last day, a Sea-man was whipt at the Main-mast, for offering to debauch two young
Boyes.
               March 26. The Wind continued still fair; but in regard we had some reason to fear
that in case the wind should fail us, as it was likely to do, we should be put to great inconveinences
for want of fresh water, a Councel was call'd, at which it was resolv'd, that we
should indeavour to make for Maurice Island, and there take in fresh water. This resolution
very much rejoyced the company. The same night, we discovered the Island called
Diego Roiz, or Diego Rodriguez, at twenty degrees, forty five minutes, in so much
that we were in hopes the next day to reach Maurice Island, as being but sixty Leagues further.
               This Island,Maurice Island described. which the Portuguez call Ilha do Cerno, and the Dutch have named Maurice,
Island, from the Prince of Orange, who was Admiral of the Vnited Provinces at the time
of their first Voyage into the Indies, lies at 20. degrees, 27. minutes, and is abour 15. leagues
in compass.
               The Haven of it is very good,Its Haven. as well in regard, that at the entrance of it there is a hundred
fathom water, as that it is able to contain above fifty great Vessels, sheltred from all
winds. It hath some Mountains, which reaching up to the Clouds are seen at a great distance,
and are extreamly delightful to the eye, in as much as Nature maintains them in a
constant verdure, though some Cocos-trees, and Date-trees, only excepted, all the other
Trees are wild.
               In the Vallies there are some Fruit-trees,And offords the best Ebony. but such as bear no Fruit are not the less esteemed
for that, for these are they which yield the fairest Ebony in all the East. Some o it is
as black as any Jet, and as smooth as Marble; but the yellow and red is of greater value
then the other, as being more rare.
               There is, as well in the Rivers of it, as the Sea about it, such abundance of Fish,
that at one casting of the Net, as many may be taken, as will fill two or three Tun
falted.
               The Hollanders in their Relations affirm,A prodigious Thornback. that they took a Thornback, which found
all in the Ship two good Meals, and that they saw there Tortoyses so big, that four
Sea-men sitting on the back of one of them, it went as well as if it had had no burthen
at all. Whereto they add, that they were so large, that ten Men might sit upon ones
Shell.
               The Island is not inhabited;The Dutch have built a or there  1640. whence it comes, that the Birds are so tame, that a man
may take them with his hand; and they are commonly killed with Cudgels, especially
the Turtles, whereof there is such abundance, that the Dutch in less then two hours, took

above a hundred and fifty, and might have taken more, if they could have carried them.
There is also great store of Herons, and a kind of Birds, of the bigness of a Swan, which
have neither Wings nor Tail, but so hard a flesh, that no heat can either boyl or roast it.
There is no four-footed Creature in all the Island:No fourfooted Beasts. but for other refreshments, and
particularly, for the taking in of fresh water, there is not a fitter place any way near
it.
               When the Dutch came thither in September,A French man lived 20. moneths in Maurice Island. 1601. they found there a French Souldier,
who had left his Country some three years before, with three English Ships, which were
the first in those parts that attempted failing into the Indies upon the account of Pyracy.
Of these three Ships, one was cast away near the Cape of Good hope, and sickness having
consumed most of the men, they that remained set fire on the second, in regard for want of
men, they were not able to govern it. The third was wrack'd upon the Coasts of the
Indies, where all the men were lost, seven only excepted, to wit, four English men, two Negroes,
and a French Souldier, who attempted to return with some booty, which they disposed
into a Cannow, wherein they set to Sea, and made a shift to get to Maurice Island.
The two Negroes had a design there to rid themselves of their Camerades, but being discovered,
they cast themselves into the Sea, and were drowned. The four English men
would prosecute their Voyage, but the French Souldier chose rather to continue in the Isle,
then double the Cape, and expose himself to the mercy of the Sea, in so small a Vessel.
Accordingly, of the English men there was no more news heard. The French man had
been twenty moneths in the Island, when the Dutch came thither. He was stark naked,
in regard that having been in a burning Feaver, which heightned into a degree of madness,
he had torn his clothes; so that having not had any thing about him ever since his
sickness, nor fed on any thing but the raw Tortoyses he took, they were not a little surpriz'd
at the sight of him, and conceived it would be no easie matter to restore him to
his Senses, though he behaved himself well enough otherwise, and was in very good
health.
               We got so near Maurice Island,The Ship uts not into the Island. that we clearly saw it, but in regard the wind continued
fair, the President called together the chief Officers, and represented to them, that if
they put into the Island, they should lose at least ten dayes time, whereas if the wind continued
fair, as it then was, we might in that time reach the Cape of Good hope, and so avoid
the inconveniences of wintering in the Island of Madagascar; whereupon it was resolved
we should prosecute our Voyage, which we did, and the same day got out of sight of
Maurice Island.
               March 29. After Sermon, the President acquainted all the men with the reasons which
had obliged him to change his resolution of taking in Water at Mourice Island, and made
it appear, that if they had gone to refresh themselves in the Island, they must have lost the
convenience of the Wind, and the fairest Season of the year, and so the means of finishing
their Voyage; exhorting all to take courage, and execute his Orders, and to be content
with their allowance, which should be equal to what those had who sate at his own
Table.
               March 30. We passed the Tropick of Capricorn, continuing our course towards West-South-West.
               April 1.APRIL??? We were at 26. degrees, three, minutes. The Wind began to abate, and towards
the night it rain'd, and blew not at all; yet ere we were so becalm'd, we had made
a shift to get forty Leagues in twenty four hours. The next day we saw several Whales,
and night the Wind rose, and in a short time grew into an absolute Tempest. Our course
was still to the West-south-west, in order to our gaining the South, which was to bring us
to the Cape of Good hope.
               The 3. We altered our course a little, taking it more towards the West. We were then
at 28. degrees, 30. minutes; and in 24. hours, we got 50. Leagues.
               April 5. We had but little Wind, and in regard the Compass still varied and declined,
we took our course towards the West, instead of taking it to the South, as we should otherwise
have done. In these two days we made 73. Leagues.
               The next day we were at 30. degrees Latitude.
               The 7. We began to perceive, that we should not long enioy the good Wind had attended
us some dayes before. Accordingly, the next day, we had a great calm, at 32. degrees
Latitude.
               The 9. The Wind rising again, put us into some confidence, that within a few dayes
we should reach the Cape of Good hope, from which we could not be above three hundred
Leagues distant.
               
                  
From that day to the 14. we still advanced somewhat. That being Easter day, the President
made a great Entertainment, whereof all in the Ship participated.
               The 15. The North-west-wind grew to a great Tempest,Pintados, a Bird discovring nearness to Land. and our Sea-men assirm'd, that
they smelt Land, being confirm'd in their perswasion, by those Birds which the Portuguez
call Pintados, and which alwayes keep within the distance of fourty Leagues of the
Land.
               The Tempest ceased with the morning of the 16th, and our Sea-men persisted in affirming
we were near the Coast, in regard many Birds were seen about the Ship.
               The 17. Towards night, there blew a fresh Gale of wind: but the next day, and the
night following, we had no wind at all, yet was the Sea as rough as it proved to be afterwards
in the Tempest, which surpriz'd us the 19. at night, with the South-west wind, at
35. degrees Latitude. We took in all our Sails, and let down the Yards, preparing our
selves by that means against the Tempests, which are very frequent, and in a manner unavoidable,
about the Cape of Good hope, and we hover'd up and down in that posture all the
next day.
               April 20. We perceiv'd that the Water was somewhat more whitish then it is in the
main Sea,Mangas de valeudo, a kind of Bird. and saw abundance of those Birds, which the Portuguez call Mangas de valeudo,
and are a kind of Sea Mews, being white all over the bodies, and having black wings. They
have also this in particular, that in their flight they beat their wings one against the other,
whereas the common Sea-Mews seldom do it, but glide through the Air in an uninterrupted
and even flight. It is observed, that where these Birds are seen, there is ground within
a hundred, or hundred and fifty fathom at most. Accordingly upon trial, we found it
at eighty fathom. We saw also the same day, a sort of Black-birds, that had only  
                  ttle
white upon the breast. The English ffirm, they are Birds presaging misfortune, as being
the infallible fore-runners of a great Tempest.
               The same day, we had one, with the West-north-west wind, which on the 24. turn'd to
a North-west. During that time we were forc'd to go before the Wind, the Water coming
into the Ship with such violence, that it took off our Carpenter; but he was so fortunate,
as to lay hold on a Rope was cast him, by which he was got aboard again. We found
ground at eighty fathom,The Cape of Agulhas. and in regard the Earth which stuck to the Plummet was lack,
we inferred thence, that we were not far from the Cap d' Agulhas, which is sixty Leagues
from that of Good hope.
               The 15. The Tempest increased so, that we began to despair of escaping, in regard the
current of the Sea forced us towards the Coasts, where we had inevitably been wrack'd, if
it had continued. We were at thirty six degrees, twenty minutes beyond the Line; and
this day we had like to have been destroyed by fire, occasioned by a Lamp in the Presidents
Chamber: but it was soon put out.
               The Storm continued all the next day.Fish oreshewing the change of weather. Our Sea-men seeing about the Ship many of
those Fish called Pesce Puercos, would thence perswade us, that it would not be long ere the
weather changed, and that the Wind would blow from the same quarter that those Fishes
came. Accordingly, about two in the afternoon, the Wind came to the North-west, and
the Tempest ceased, so that we could spread our Sails.
               The 27. We had no Wind at all, but in the afternoon, it came to the North-west, which
obliged us to take our Course to the North-north-west, failing two Leagues an hour. We
saw that day a great number of Trombas,Trombas. from which we inferred we were not far from the
Cape of Good hope. These Yrombas are a kind of great Canes, about the bigness of a mans
arm, and three or four foot long, which flote upon the water with their roots, as if the Sea
had forced them away from the neighbouring Coast; yet can it not be said whence they
come, nor that they are seen any where but about that Cape.
               April 28. We discovered the Coast, which before us reach'd from North to West. Some
thought at first it was Gabo-Falso, or the Cape of Good hope; but finding ground at forty
Fathom, and at thirty four degrees, forty minutes, they were soon convinced, that it was
the Cap d' Agulhas, whence it came that we went all that day laveering with a North-west
wind.
               The 29. The Wind came to the South-east, so that we continued our course to the
North-west, keeping still in sight of the Land. That day we took as many Fith as found
the whole company two or three good meals. The night following the Wind changed,
and came to the North-west, obliging us to laveer; but being in a manner directly contrary,
we advanced but little. Taking the Altitude of the Sun that day, we found our selves
at 34. degrees, 27. minutes, and consequently, that we wanted 24. Leagues of being at the
Altitude of Capd' Agulhas.
               April 30. We continued laveering along the Coast, the Wind being still contrary.
               
                  
May 1. The wind coming to the North-east by East, we kept along the Coast, and
perceived a very high shore,MAY. which was at last known to be Cabo Falso, which is
within seven Leagues of that of Good hope.Cabo Falso It is called Cabo Falso, because it is seen at
a great distance, extending it self into the Sea much after the same manner as the other,
though it be not so high.
               The 2. A North-east wind brought us in sight of the Cape of Good hope;They discover the Cape of Good hope but turning
immediately to the North-west, we could not possibly enter the Bay, which obliged us to
make off the Coast, and get into the main Sea, taking our course towards the South.
               The next day, with a North-west wind, we had a great tempest, which yet hindred
us not from getting somewhat nearer the Coast. That day we cast one of our Sea
men over-board, with the ordinary Ceremonies used at funerals upon such occasions.
This was the third man died out of our Ship, since our departure from Goa.
               May 4. We doubled one of the points of the Cape of Good hope, which is about
ten Leagues distant from the Road or Bay, and much about the same time we discovered
the Mountain, which the Dutch, in the year 1601. named the Tafelherg, it being
flat and square at the top like a Table. It was our intention to get into the
Bay, which is at the foot of the Mountain, and at 34. Degrees, four Minutes, within
fifteen Leagues of the Cape; but the wind being contrary, obliged us to keep along the
Coast, endeavouring to make the best advantage we could of it.
               The 5. At Sun-rising, we were out of sight of Land; whereupon we changed our
course, taking it North-east, and turning the prow of the Ship towards the Coast, which
we discovered about noon. About two in the afternoon, we passed in sight of the
Island called St. Elizabeth, which is inhabited, and at night we got into the Bay, and cast
anchor at seven fathom water.
               This Promontory of the Continent of Africk,The Cape of Good hop
                   which extends it self into the Sea towards
the South, at 36. Degrees beyond the Line, was named Cabo de bn' Speranza, by
Iohn II. King of Portugal, under whom it was discovered, by Bartholomew Dias,
about the year 1493. That Prince would needs call it so, out of the hopes he conceived
to discover afterwards the wealth of the East-Indies; and other Nations have continued
that name, upon this account, that having once doubled the Cape, there is
some assurance of compleating the Voyage, whereof the Cape makes one half, as lying
in a manner at the equal distance of two thousand five hundred Leagues between Europe,
and the most Easterly Coast of the Indies.
               Most Ships take in refreshments at this place, and the Dutch are wont to leave there
under a Stone at the entrance of the Haven, some Letters, wherein they acquaint the
Ships that are coming after them, with whatever had hapned to them in their Voyage,
and the course they take at their departure thence. The water there is excellent good,
and so easie to come at, that the taking of it in, is without any trouble. Cattle are very
cheap; their Oxen are large, and have bunches on their back, as those of the Indies;
and there are some Sheep, whose flesh is extreamly delicate; they have long ears, and
their tails are as big and weighty, as a good hind quarter of Mutton.
               They have also all sorts of wild Fowl,Pinquins a kind of owl and those Creatures that are hunted, Deer, wild
Boars, Partridges, Quails, &c. and among the rest, a kind of Geese, which they call Pinguins,
which have no wings, but stumps, and consequently cannot raise themselves off the ground.
It is an amphibious Animal, and with those stumps makes a shift to swim. A man may
take them up with his hands, but the flesh of them is not edible, it is so hard and insipid.
There are also Dogs, or rather Sea-bears, Camels, Tygres, Lyons and Lynxes.
               The Inhabitants are of low Stature,The Inhabitants about the Cape of Goodhope ugly and ill-shap'd, living more like Beasts, then
men. Their faces are wrinkled, their hair full of grease and nastiness, and they stink so,
that they are smelt assoon as they are seen; which proceeds not only hence, that they
rub their bodies with train Oyl, but also from their constant eating of raw flesh. They
never kill a beast in order to the eating of it, but feed on them only when they die of
any disease. A dead Whle cast up by the Sea upon the shore, is an excellent dish of meat
with them; as is also the hot entrails of some beast, which they eat with all the filth about
them, having only taken out the excrements, wherewith some rub their faces.
               They go naked,Their clthing. save that both men and women cover their privy parts with a triangular
piece of skin, which they fasten with leathern girdle about the waste: Some of
the men cover their buttocks and thighs with a Lyons skin, or Oxe hide, drawing up the
taile between their legs, so that it covers not what they intend should not be seen. Nay, there
are some, who wear a skin, which comes down from the shoulders to the waste, and cut their
faces, arms and thighs, in which they make divers strange incisions and characters, which
though they were ugly enough before, adds somewhat to their deformity. The women wear

about their Arms and Leggs, rings of Iron or Brass, which they receive from strangers
for their Cattle.
               They who live near the Sea-coast feed only upon Oysters,Their food. Fish, such Herbs as Nature
produces thereabouts, and the Whales cast up by the Sea: but such as inhabit further
within the Countrey, and are called Soltanimans, live a little better, though they are
no less barbarous and savage then the others.
               They do not cultivate the Ground,Vse no husbandry. though it be excellent good and very fertile, nor
do they understand any thing of improving and ordering the fruit which Nature bestows
on them. They all live in little Huts, or in the same place with their Cattel, without
Beds, Stools, or any such superfluous pieces of houshold stuff. Their way of resting
themselves is to sit upon their heels. They are never seen near the Sea, but only when
they think to drive some Trade, in trucking their Cattle, Ox-hides, Lions, Leopards,
Tigers-skins, and Ostritch Feathers, for Kives, Looking-glasses, Nailes, Hammers,
Hatchets, and other pieces of old Iron, to their great advantage who come thither.
               They have no knowledg at all of God,Know neither God nor the Devil. nor never heard any talk of the Devil; but
all the mischief they fear, is, what may be done them by the Lyons, against whom they
are forc'd to fortifie themselves in the night time by great fires, which they make all
about their quarters.
               May 10. Having fill'd all our Vessels with fresh water,Lions their only enemies and bought ewo Oxen of the
Soltanimans, who were unwilling to sell any more, we reimbarked, intending to get ou
of the Bay that day, but the contrary wind would not permit us. The next day, we sent
our Boat to bring aboard us fifteen persons, to wit, four men, eight women, and three
children, to be transported into the Island of Pingui, which is at the entrance of the Bay,
where those poor people were in hopes to live more at their ease upon the Carcasses of
Whales, which the Sea is wont to cast ashore there, and to be free from the persecutions
of the Soltanimans. The Boat returned in the Evening, loaden with all sorts of Birds,
especially Pinguins, which had been all kill'd with sticks.
               May 12. Being Sunday, we weighed Anchor before day, and got out of the Bay
with a North-east Wind, taking our course Westward. The next day it came to North-north-east,
and afterwards to the North, and in the afternoon, we had not any at all: So
that we continued all the remainder of the day in sight of the coast. At night it came to
the South, but in less then two hours, it returned again to the North, and about midnight
we had such a Tempest, that we were forc'd to take in all our Sails.
               The 17. The Tempest which had continued ever-since the 12. grew so high, that had
not our Ship been very sound, and of great burthen, it could not possibly have resisted
the violence of the winds and waves, which so covered it sometimes, that all upon the
Deck were wet to the skin.
               The next day the Skie cleared up, and the wind was something allayed, but still
contrary. We took the elevation, and sound our selves, at 34. Degrees, 40. Minutes;
whence we concluded, that we were between Cabo Falso, and the Cape of Good hope, and
consequently, that the Wind had forc'd us back 25. or 30. Leagues, yet in the evening
we had in a manner recover'd what we had lost; but the night following, the wind was
so violent, as if the Elements had been near their resolution into their first Chaos.
               These extraordinary winds are called Hurricans,Hurricans. and they come not with such fury, but
once in seven years, though the Sea in those parts be ordinarily tempestuous. We lost
in that tempest two of our best Sea men, who fell from the Scnttle into the Sea, where
one was immediately swallowed up; the other had so much strength as to lay hold 
the rope was cast out to him, and got into the Ship; but falling on the sides of the Ship
he had so bruised himself, that he died within an hour after. The contrary wind forced
us into the main Sea, and reduc'd us to such extremities, that we were not so much
concern'd in the prosecution of our Voyage, as the saving of our lives; in as much as
had the Sea made the least breach in the Ship, it had been impossible for us to
escape.
               The next day, the contrary wind continuing in the same violence, we were still in the
same danger, having no other hope, but what the next change of the Moon gave us.
But though she appeared the next day above the Horizon, yet the tempest was nothing
abated, till the rain somewhat allay'd the wind the 22. so that we could make use of our
sails, indeavouring to keep our course Westward.
               May 23. VVe had a calm, during which the Ship stirr'd not from the same place.
VVe discovered the Coast North-east of us; and in regard we were then at 37, Degrees,
six Minutes, we imagined our selves to be in the same Altitude with the Coast which

lies between Cabo Palso, and that of Agulhas. In the evening the wind increased, and
brought with it a tempest, from the West-north-west, which forc'd us to put off from the
Coast.
               The 24. The wind continued strll contrary, and in the evening there rose such a
tempest, as forced us to go all night before the wind.
               The 25. We resum'd our course with a West wind, taking it South-west. We
were that day at 36. Degrees Latitude.
               The 26. With the Sun-rising, we had the North-east wind, which made us put out
all our Sails, taking our course West, and sayling after the rate of two Leagues an hour.
But in the evening, the wind turned to the North-west, with so great likelyhood of a
tempest, that it was thought fit to take in part of our Sails. Accordingly, the wind
increased so by degrees, that we were forc'd to take in all but the main Sail, which
was not taken in till the wind grew so violent, as if it would have confounded all the
Elements, to have swallowed us up in the disorder. Nay, its fury was such, that our
Ship which had resisted all before, as a Rock, was tossed by the waves like a little boat.
I must confess it was through Gods infinite mercy to us, that we escaped that danger,
wherein we were in all likelihood, to perish, since it was a kind of Miracle, that the Masts
stood, considering the violence of the winds was such, as might have rooted up the
strongest Trees. This dreadfull Tempest continued the 28. and 29. with so little intermission,
that we began to despair of prosecuting our Voyage, inasmuch as the first quarter
of the Moon had brought no change of weather: whereupon it was taken into consideration
whether it were not our safest course to go and pass over the Winter in the
Island of Madagascar. It was urged, that the Ship, having been much batter'd by
the waves, would not be able to hold out much longer, and that though it should,
our provisions would not, and so it would be impossible for us to compleat our Voyage.
This proposal was generally approved; but when it was considered on the other
side, that that delay, which must have been at least six moneths, would be an inconvenience
equal to the imminent danger we were in, it was thought the best course to prosecute
the Voyage.
               But May 30. The President having called all the Officers together, and represented to
them the condition of the Ship, and the little likelihood there was of compleating the
Voyage; Nay, on the contrary, that the wind might be more violent, as the Moon increased,
and that coming in September, or October upon the Coasts of England, the dange
would be as great as that they were then in upon those of Africk, it was resolved,
that to preserve the Ship, we should put into the Island of Madagascar, and stay
there till September, inasmuch as within that time there would come thither some English
Vessels, which might supply us with things necessary for the prosecution of our
Voyage.
               According to this resolution, we tack'd about at two in the afternoon, the weather
so tempestuous, that we could beat but two Sails. We saild two Leagues an hour,
but the Sea was so rough, that many times the waves came over the Ship. This
tempest continued till the next day, but about noon it ceased.
               Iune the first,IUN. We faild on, with a VVest wind, taking our course East-ward;
VVe put out all our Sails, so that in 24. hours, we got forty Leagues.
               The next being Whitsunday, the Tigre we brought from Surat bit the President in
the hand, and had forc'd it off, had not I and some others come seasonably in. About
11. at night, the wind changed, and came to South-south-east, which was the best point
we could have wihed it in for our return; insomuch that we immediately chang'd our
resolution, and set things in order to our return to the Cape of Good hope, with an intention,
to take in fresh water at the Island of Saint Helene.
               The same wind continued the third of Iune, insomuch that about noon, we were got
to 35. Degrees, 8. Minutes.
               Iune 4. VVe saw abundance of the Manga's de Valudo, but the wind changed, so that
we had much ado to keep on our course to South-south-west, and afterwards to North-north-west
towards the Coast. VVe saw also abundance of Trombas, whence we inferred
we were not far from the Cape of Good hope.
               The 6. VVe had no wind at all, so that we spent the day in fishing. We found
sometimes, 43. and 48. sometimes 54. and 63. fathome water. Towards night, we had
a good North-west wind.
               The 7. The wind came to West; and at night we had so great a tempest, that
we were forc'd to take in all our Sails.
               Iune 8. The Tempest continuing with the same violence, we could advance but little.

About midnight, it came North, and we took our course Northwest.
               The 9. The wind ceased, and having taken the Altitude, we were at 35 Degrees,
30. Minutes. In the afternoon we had a North-west wind, with a dreadful Tempest,
which forced us to take in all our Sails, and go before the wind, in some danger of
running upon the coast. This was the saddest night we had in all our Voyage. For the
Master of the Ship fearing the reproaches of his superiours, if he came not to England
within the year, endeavoured all he could to prosecute the Voyage; but finding at
last, all was to no purpose, he acknowledged there was no other way to save the Ship
and the persons in it, but to put in somewhere. Whereupon it was immediately resolv'd
we should go and winter in Madagascar; and so we presently changed our course.
               The 11. The weather was fair; but about midnight the sky was so overcast, that it
was not doubted but a Tempest was coming, as indeed it did, and continued the three
next dayes.
               The 15. It ceased, and the wind being VVest-north-west, we took our course to
the North-east, and in 24. hours, got 33. Leagues.
               The 16. We got 44 Leagues. The 17th. 50. with an East-south-east wind, taking our
course to the North-east.
               The 18. VVe got 30. with a VVest-South-west wind; the 19th. 40. and the 20th.
having failed 30. Leagues, we were at 31. Degrees 15. Minutes Latitude.
               The 23. At break of day, we discovered a Vessel, which soon came up to us. It
was a Ship belonging to the new Company, of 500. Tun burthen, and came out of
England some four moneths before, under the command of Captain Hall, who being
sick, and not able to stir, sent to the President to desire him he would honour him so
far as to come aboard his Vessel, which he did, taking along with him the Physitian
and my self. He not only treated us kindly, but also proffer'd to supply us with
Cordage and Sails, in case we met not with any Vessels of the old Company at Madagascar:
whither it was resolved they should make all the haste they could; Captain
Hall's Ship being less, and not so loaden as ours,IVLY. going before, with a South-east wind.
               The first of Iuly,They discover Madagascar. he was got out of sight, and in the evening we discovered the
Coast. VVe doubted not but it was Madagascar, and so had a watch set in the night,
to see we came not too near it, as also that we put not off too ar from it: It being on
the one side hard to approach, it having once lost the Altitude, and on the other, dangerous
to approach it in the night time, by reason of the Rocks that are at the point of
the Island,Arive there and especially by reason of the little Island, at the entrance of the Bay.
               The 2. We arrived at Madagascar, and got into the Bay of Saint Augustin, finding
no bottom, till within a quarter of a League of Land, where we cast Anchor, at
25. fathom water, glad we were got into a Harbour, after so many dangers escaped.
               Our joy was highted by our finding in the Bay two English ships, belonging to the
same Company, one whereof was upon her return for England; the other bound for
the Indies. It was but three months since the latter came from England; commanded
by Captain Willis, being 1400. Tun burthen. Her name was the London, and she was
one of the noblest Vessels I ever saw. The Captain came immediately aboard us, accompanied
by a young Merchant, and proffer'd the President to supply him with all
things necessary for the prosecution of his Voyage.
               The 3. The Officers of all the three ships had a meeting aboard ours, to consider
what course they should take with the Inhabitants, that they might not hold their
provisions at too dear a rate; and it was resolved, that what ever were bought should
be bought upon a common account; and to that end, every one should bring out the
commodities they were willing to truck, which should be put off by the Secretaries of the
three Ships.
               The Glass-bracelets, beads and Agats, we had brought from the Indies were incomparably
beyond what they were laden with,What Commodities go off at Madagascr. out of Europe; so that it was resolved ours
should not be produced, till the others were sold. By this means, we bought every
day four Oxen for forty pair of Glass-bracelets, which the Inhabitants call Rangus; a
Sheep for two, and a Calf for three Rangus; and for a brass ring, ten or twelve inches
about, a man might have an Oxe worth here six or seven pound.
               The 4. The President, Captain Willis, and Captain Hall, went up the River to discover
the Countrey, and to see what Cattle was brought down to the Bay. We found neer
Captain Willis's Tent about thirty men, and some women, who had brought milk to
sell. They had brought also about twenty Oxen, Sheep, and Goats: but hearing
there was a greater number coming after them, we provided our selves only for three
dayes.
               
                  
The 6. The President invited the two Captains and all the Officers of both the other
Ships to dinner; and some dayes after Captain Willis treated the whole Company. In the
afternoon he entertain'd us with a Comedy, which lasted above three hours.
               The 14. Captain Hall went on his Voyage towards the Indies, and the 16. Captain Willis
went away also, having supplied us with all things necessary for the prosecution of ours.
He intended to touch at the Maldives, and stay there till the 20. of August, that he might
arrive at Surat in the Winter. We accompanied him to the Island, at the entrance of the
Bay, and having taken leave of him, went into the Island, where we found abundance of
odd Shells of divers forms, several sorts of Fish cast up there by the Sea, and rotted Cocos,
which the Wind had forced thither from the Eastern Coast of Madagascar, where some
grows, but not from the Coast of the Saint Augustines Bay, which is opposite to the
West.
               The 21. The President took up his Lodging in the Tent pitched for him on the Seaside,
intending to continue there, till he imbark'd in order to our return. They made
there also certain Huts, for the Souldiers that were about him, as also for such as were
repairing some things belonging to the Ship, and for the Butchers, who kill'd and salted
the Beef for the Provision of the Ship: but on Sundayes all came aboard, where there
was a Sermon.
               About four Leagues from the Haven,The Lord of those parts??? there lives a Lord, who had three Sons, the eldest
of whom was named Massar. They came all three to see us, with a retinue of about a
hundred men, arm'd with a kind of Pikes. They brought along with them about three
hundred Oxen, some Sheep, Goats, Poultry, Citrons, and Oranges, to truck for our Commodities.
Being come near the President, they made a little halt, to observe what posture
we were in, and at last the eldest of the three Brothers came up, and bestowed on the President
twelve Goats, and his two Wives gave him, each of them, a fat Capon. The President
presented him with three Strings of Glass Coral, each of his Brothers with two, and
each of the Wives with a Bracelet. This signified but very little to us; but they highly
valued them.Makes an alliance with the English. They planted a great Pole in the ground, as a mark of the Alliance they
made with us, promising severely to punish such as should injure us, and desiring us to take
such a course, as no disorder might happen on our side. They desired to hear our Musick,
and seem'd to be much pleased with it. They sold us ten fat Oxen, some Sheep,
Goats and Poultry. They sold us a fat Sheep, the Tail whereof weighed twenty or
twenty four pound for seven or eight grains of Coral or Agat, and a Capon for three or
four grains of counterfeit Coral. They would not meddle with our money, as being so
happy as not to know the value of a thing which occasions the misery of other parts of
the World.
               During the six weeks we staid in the Island, most of our diversion was shooting at Buts,
or fishing with the Angle-rod. We took good store of Fish, and some Oysters, which the
Inhabitants call Oring. These stick to the Trees and Bushes that are upon the Sea-side,
being at high-water cover'd with the Tide. They are large, and as delicate as any England
affords.
               From the fifth to the eighth of August,AVGVST there were such abundance of Grashoppers, that
they deprived us of the fight of the Sun. The Inhabitants eat them, but they look on
them as fore-runners of famine and mortality of Cattle. One small shower of Rain dispersed
them all.
               As for the Island of Madagascar,Madagascar described. which the French call the Island of St. Laurence, (either
from its being discovered by Laurence, Son of Francisco Almeyda, General of the
King of Portugal's Army in the Indies, or from its being done upon Saint Laurence his
day,Its greatness. in the year 1506.) It lies in the torrid Zone, reaching from North to South, from the
tenth to the twenty sixth degree. 'Tis certainly one of the greatest Islands in the World,
since it is above 150. Leagues in length,Its Havens. and 180. in breadth, and hath many good Harbours,
whereof the chiefest are, St. Augustine's Bay, where we put in, St. Iago, Anton Gil,
Antipera, St. Iulian's, St. Maries, St. Sebastians, St. Romanus and Manatenga. Its Mountains
are for the most part covered with Citron-trees and Orange-trees; and if any are
bare and rocky, that Rock is an excellent white Marble, out of which issues forth the best
Water in the World. Some of them are covered with a kind of Trees, the Wood whereof
is of all sorts of colours, (but especially, such as afford Ebony, and a certain Wood, which
in colour comes near that of Brasil, whereof they make their Lances or Pikes) and Date-trees,
which gives shelter to an infinite number of Apes and Birds, and among others, a
kind of Hens, as big as Turkies, save that they were black all over the body, but marked
with little white spots. Their heads are between a red and blew colour, and in their foreheads
they have a yellow horn. They feed in the Woods whole hundreds of them together.
               
                  
There is also great store of that Gum, which the Druggists call Dragons-bloud, which
is drawn out of the flower of a Tree,Dragons-bloud. about the bigness of a Pear-tree, but much more
branchy, and not so full of leaves. Its leaves are longer, but narrower then those of
Lawrel, and the flower is taken off in order to the extracting of the juyce, and put
into hollow Canes, wherein it is reduced to that form, in which it is brought into
Europe.
               This Island affords also some Aloes,Aloes. a Commodity we have before given an account of, in
the description of the Island of Zocotora. That which grows in Madagascar, is not so
good as the other, in regard it is wild; yet it is used in Medicine, nay, many times instead
of the other. They have also Cotton and Indico, but they make it not into a paste, as
they do in Indosthan, and elsewhere.
               Their greatest wealth consists in Cattel.The Island rich in Cattle. For where they do till the ground, it is only
to get a little Rice, which is excellent good there, as also for Beans, Pompions, and that kind
of Melons, which the Persians call Harpus. There are also several sorts of Citron-trees,
and Orange-trees, which bring forth twice a year, Date-trees, Cocos-trees, and Bananas. No
House but hath some Hives of Bees about it; but they have not yet the invention of making
Wax, nor using their Honey, otherwise then in making a certain Drink of it with
Rice, which serves them instead of Wine. The ground yields Salt, and Saltpeter, and upon
the Sea-coasts there is found abundance of Ambergreece. It is reported also, that there
are mines of Gold and Silver; but the Inhabitants making no use of these Metals, and valuing
Tin above Silver, have not yet search'd into them.
               Madagascar is very populous,Its Inhabitams. and the Inhabitants are for the most part Negroes, of a
good stature, and well shap'd. All the clothing they wear is only a piece of Cotton-cloth,
of several colours, which they so fasten about their Waste, that one of the ends hangs
down to the Knee before, and the other to the Ham behind, and in the night they take it
off, and make it serve for a Coverlet. They lie upon Mats, and in regard their Huts are
made only of the branches of Trees, (those litle wooden Houses only excepted which
they make for their Princes) they make a fire of all sides of them, against the Mill-dew,
which i seems is there very dangerous. Some wear above their Navels a row of Glassbeads
of several colours, and several Bracelets of them about their Necks, their Arms, or
above the Elbow, and about their Legs under the gartering place. Both Men and Women
have their Ears bored through, and put into them Copper Rings, somewhat like, but
not so large as those they wear about their Wrists, and the small of the Leg. Their
Hair is black, but not equally curled all over the Country, and they dispose it into several
tresses, but it grows not much, though they grease it perpetually, and do all they
can to get long Hair. There is little difference between the clothing of the Men, and
that of the Women, save that the Women wear also a kind of sleeveless long Coat, and
that the Cloth wherewith they cover themselves is so large, that it hides all their Thighs
almost down to the Knee. In this Cloth they carry their Children upon their Backs, so
as that putting their Legs under the Mothers Arms, they seem to be in a manner fastned
together, and yet as she carries them, a Man would think, they should fall backwards, and
break their back-bones.
               The fidelity of Wives towards their Husbands is here exemplary, and the Men think it
no disparagement to take their advice. No Man but hath at least two Wives, but dispos'd
into several Huts. For the more aged of the two he hath most compliance, though he undertakes
no business, nor concludes any bargain, till he hath consulted both. These they
buy of their Parents, or rather Relations, for a certain number of Oxen, Pikes, or other
Arms. Adultery and Fornication is punished with death; but they do not easily suspect
one another. They are very free in their conversation, and there is no familiarity so great
as to raise any jealousie in them.
               Some young Women made no difficulty to come into our Tent; nay, one of them made
not any to take one of my Shirts from the President, who intreated her to wear it for my
sake. She accordingly wore it two dayes, but afterwards tore it to pieces, to be used about
other things.
               The Men are couragious,The men are courageous. and well skill'd in the use of their Lances, Darts, and Pikes,
which they carry along with them where ever they go. When they are at work, their
Arms lie not far from them, and they are accustomed to them from the eighth or ninth year
of their age.
               Some Persons of Quality have a bundle of twenty five or thirty of these little Pikes carried
after them.Their Arms. They use also Bows and Arrows, and their Bowes are at least five or six
foot long, the String being very loose, yet have they a sleight of shooting with a miraculous
swiftness and strength. When they cast their Pikes or Javelings, they make several

postures, and are so expert at this exercise, that at the distance of forty paces they will not
miss a bird.
               The Inhabitants of Madagascar are divided into several Tribes,Their Chief which consist of Cantons
of a 100. 200. and 300. persons, and live like Tartars, under a Chief, whom they
call Tsehich, that is, King, or Lord. There were two of these Princes lived in a wood
neer our Tent, where they had built them huts under Date-trees. VVhen their cattle
multiplies so as that the grass falls short, they engage in a kind of a war among themselves,
and endeavour to get what they can from their neighbours. King Massar, whom
we named before, told us, that he had joyn'd with two other Kings, named Machicore,
Schich Tango, and Andiam Palola, with whom he made account to get together a body of
500. men, and to set upon some of their neighbours, who had better pastures then theirs.
These Princes have an absolute power over their Subjects, and severely punish the crimes
committed within their jurisdictions, especially such as tend to the disturbance of the
Publick peace: but this dignity is not so continued in the same Family, but that upon
the Prince's death, the strongest is advanced to this pretended Crown.
               It were a hard matter to say what Religion they are off,Their Religion. save that as I have been informed,
they belive there is one God, who hath made Heaven and Earth; and will one
day punish bad Actions, and reward the good. I saw one among them, who was certainly
their Priest, getting up a tree, and speaking to the People, for above half an hour:
but not one of us understanding their Language, I know not what discourse he made to
them, nor yet what difference there is between their Priests and the others; save that I
observ'd, they carried at the end of a Cane a piece of a Cowes-tail, and that one of them
suffered the nailes of the two fore-fingers of his right hand to grow to the length of Eagles
claws. Every Canton hath its Priest, who would also be accounted Sorcerers, and
have it thought they can binde the Devil, and force him to do what they please.
               The Portuguez of the Island of Mozambique,Mozambique. which is but half a league from the Continent
of Africk, drive a considerable trade here in Aloes, Dragons-blood, Ebony, and
other Drugs. For the Captain, who under the King of Portugal hath the command of
this little Island, which is but half a league in compass, and who, in the three years of
his Government, gets a hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, is not a little obliged
to the Neighbour-hood of Madagascar, though the greatest part of his wealth comes
from Soffola, where he hath his Factor, and where the Portuguez have built a Fort.
               Hieronymus Osorius,When discovered by the Portuguez. in his History of the Life and Actions of Emanuel King of Portugal,
affirms, that when the Portuguez discovered the Island of Madagascar, in the year
1506. there came aboard their Ship as many Negroes as a boat could well carry. They
were kindly receiv'd, and had several little Presents made them; but they ill requited that
civility, for assoon as they were got into their own boat, they shot so many Arrows at the
Portuguez, that they were forc'd to answer them with Cannon and Musket-shot. The
same year another Portuguez Captain, named, Rodrigo Pereira, being cast by a tempest upon
the Eastern Coast of this Island, he sent word to the Inhabitants, by an African Moor,
who understood somewhat of their Language, that the design of his coming thither, was
to enter into an alliance with them, and to settle an advantagious Commerce for both.
The Islanders seem'd to approve of this Proposal, and told the Moor, they would carry
him to their King, that he might conclude with him the Treaty desired by the Portuguez,
but being got off a little from the others, they fell upon him, and had kill'd him, had
they not discharg'd some Muskets at them, whereby some fell, and the rest were forc'd
to let go the Moor. The Portuguez Captain having got him again, landed at another
place, where he surprized the Inhabitants, and took their King Prisoner: but treated
him so well, that he proffer'd to bring them to a place, where they should find a good
Haven for their Ship. He brought the Portuguez Captain to a Bay, at the entrance whereof
there was a very populous Island, whereat the Inhabitants were frightned, and fled
into the great Island, forsaking Wives and Children, nay even their King: so that it
proved no hard matter for the Portuguez to possess themselves of the Island; whence
they sent to the Inhabitants, Inviting them to return, and to permit their planting among
them, since they desired only their friendships. They returned, and presented the Captain
with 50. Oxen, and 20. Goats; but, to be rid of their Guests, they represented to
them, that there were greater advantages to be made in the Port of Matatana, inasmuch
as there they would find Silver and several Drugs to truck for. The Captain would have
gone thither, but the current of the Sea having forc'd one of his Ships upon the Coast,
he retired with the other to the Island of Mozambique. The same Tempest which had
cast that Captain upon the Eastern Coast of the Island, forc'd another Ship of the
same Fleet into the Port of Matatana, whither there presently came one of the boats

of the Country, into which he sent the Master of his Vessel, who by the many Voyage
he had made upon the Coasts of Africk, and learnt the Language of the Countrey. The
Negroes having him in their boat, made all the haste they could ashore, which obliged the
Portuguez to put out their shallop, with fourscore men in it, to overtake them; but the
Negroes were too quick for them, and carried away the man. The Shallop coming near
Land, the Portuguez saw their Master, who told them he had been brought to their King,
and civilly received by him, and that he was desirous to speak with the Captain, and
enter into friendship with him. The Captain made no difficulty to go ashore, where the
King received him kindly, and treated him magnificently, according to the custom of the
Country: but thinking to return in the Evening, there rose so great a tempest, that it was
impossible for him to get aboard. The tempest continued four dayes, so that those who
were in the Ship, believed that their Captain had been kill'd by the Barbarians, weighed
Anchor, and returned to Mozambique. The Captain finding the Ship gone, and that
there was little likelihood of ever getting out of the Island, grew so discontented that
he died of it. Eight other Persons of his retinue died also, and they who remained embarked
in the Shallop, choosing rather to expose themselves to the uncertain event of a
dangerous Navigation, then stay in a place where they must perish within a few days;
and they were so happy as to meet with a Vessel commanded by the Captain Iohn
Fonseca, who received them aboard, and carried them into Africk.
               The first landing of the Dutch in this Island,The fist landing of the Dutch  Madagasc. was in August 1595. at which they
met with as great difficulties as the Portuguez had done. Their design was only to refresh
themselves there, upon this account; that, in those first Voyages, they had so little
knowledge of the disease called the Scurvy, and the remedies now used for the
cure of it, that most of their men being not able to perform their labour, they were
forced to touch there in order to some relief for their diseased: but ere they could
meet with any refreshment, there died above 70. persons out of the four Vessels whereof
their Fleet consisted, whom they buried in a little Island, which upon that occasion
they called, The Dutch-Church-yard. The description they make of this Island is very
short, and for the most part, taken out of the Relation of Mark Paulo Vnet, which is
none of the most exact. That of Francis Couche of Rouen, Printed by the means of the
late M. du Puy, is so exact, that that of the Dutch cannot compare with it. What these
last relations have in particular, is, that the Inhabitants of Madagascar are circumcised,
though there be nothing otherwise that evinces them to be Mahumetans, since they have
no Mosques, nor any exercise of Religion, nor appearance of Devotion in all their Demeanour.
               Having passed over the Winter on the other side of the Aequinoctial Line, we began to
set things in order for the prosecution of our Voyage, and bought the 19. of August, of
King Masiar, and two other neighbouring Princes, Tsebich Tanga, and Andiam Palola,
twenty five fat Oxen more, and about a hundred Sheep and Goats, besides the hundred and
fifty Oxen we had bought during our aboad in the Island, all which we put aboard the
20. that we might not want fresh meat during our Voyage. The same day we embarked
our baggage, and the next day we got out of the Bay of St. Augustine, and left
the Island of Madagascar, with a South-west wind, which continuing all the night following,
we soon got out of sight of the Island.
               The 22. The Manson, which we could not yet have hoped for, came unexpectedly upon
us, and advanced our progress very much, taking our course to West-south-west.
               The 23. The wind came to the East, so that having it full behind us, we went on merrily,
taking our course the more towards the South, to avoid the Cape of Good hope, where
we intended not to touch at all.
               The 24. and 25. the wind was somewhat abated; but the 26. it blew so fresh a gale,
that we made a great progress. We were that day at 27. degrees, 27. minutes Latitude;
and the 28th. at 28. degrees, 12. minutes.
               The 29. We had the wind East-south-east, with those storms which the Portuguez
call Travados: They were immediately over. We saw that day, being at 31. degrees,
15. minutes Latitude, a great number of the Fishes called Pesce puercos, which leaped
three or four foot above water, as if it had been their design to find us sport. The next
day we had a Tempest, yet such as hindered not our getting somewhat forward; so that the
last of August, we were at 33. degree, 34. minutes.
               September the first,SEPTEMBER. the wind grew so violent, that we were forc'd to take in part of our
sails, yet we made a shift to get 50. Leagues in 24. hours. The next day, we got but 30.
the wind being South-west.
               The 3. The Sea being very calm, we kill'd one of the Cowes we had bought in Madagascar,

and found three Calves in the belly of it; as also a Goat, that had four young Kids within
it; from which a man may judge of the fruitfulness of the Country.
               At night we saw up and down certain Lights, like flames; but we could not judge
whether they were the Fishes, which the Spaniards call Dorads, and the English Blubbers,
or those Meteors, which the Spaniards call Cuerpos sanctos. In ancient time, when
there appear'd two, they were called Castor and Pollux, Dioscures, and Tyndarides, and
when but one, it was called Helene. Some have not shaken off the superstition of believing,
that their fire presages a Tempest. But, on the contrary, we had a great calm, the
next day, and saw infinite multitudes of little Sea-birds. About two in the afternoon,
we had a North-east wind, which continuing fair all the next day, we failed above two
Leagues an hour.
               September 6. We had a great tempest; It continued all night, and shook the Ship so,
that the water coming in at several places, we were forc'd to pump four times an hour.
The same day we came 35. degrees Latitude.
               The 7. The weather was somewhat fair, so that we made use of our Sails, taking
our course West-north-west. The Sea was very rough, and forc'd us towards the Coast,
from which we thought our selves fourty Leagues distant, and from the Cape of Good
hope 130. The 8. and 9. the wind South, and it proved rainy weather.
               The 10. We had but little wind, yet got 40 Leagues in 24 hours; we saw many of the Mangas
de Valudo; whence it was inferred we could not be far from the Cape d' Aglhas:
               The 11. We made but a small progress, with an East wind. Casting the plummet,
and finding a sandy bottome, one hundred and twenty fathom water, we are confirmed
in the opinion we had before, of our being near Cape d' Agulhas.
               The 12. The contrary wind forc'd us to laveering to the North-north-west, and Southwest,
going either further from, or neerer to the Coast, which yet they could not discover.
In the afternoon, we resumed our course to the West-north-west, with a Southwest
wind, and at night we found a yellowish sand, at 190. fathom water.
               The 13. Our course was to the West-north-west, with a South-east wind. About 10.
we saw a dead Whale floating upon the water; and being then at 35. degree latitude,
we conceiv'd we might be at the altitude of the Cape of Good hope, where many of
these creatures are ordinarily seen.
               The 14. we found at Sun-rising,Declinat of the Loadstone. that the Compass declin'd four degrees, 50. minutes
to the East, whence we inferr'd, that we had compass'd the Cape of Good hope.
               The next day, we had the wind so full a Stern, that had it been contrary, it would
have forc'd us once more to think of putting into some place, or at least put us to the same
extremities we had been in before near the Cape. We therefore found the declination of
the Load-stone to be one degree, fifty minutes, and presently after, the declination of it
near the Cape of Good hope, is four degrees, though otherwise it doth not decline so much.
Assoon as the Cape is past, the Compass still varies towards the East, in regard the
Needle draws to the Earth, where no doubt there is Iron, and other Load-stones that
draw it: but the declination on that Coast never exceeds eight degrees.
               About 20. Leagues on this side the Cape of Good hope, and at 33. degrees, 15. minutes,
lies the Island of St. Elizabeth.The Island of St. Elizabeth. It is not above two Leagues distant from the Coasts of
Africk, and hath a very good Haven towards the Continent, at 16. fathome water. The
Coast of the Isle is but one continued Rock, but there grows such abundance of delicate
Herbs in the Island, that it may be presum'd it would afford as great conveniencies and refreshments
as that of St. Helene, if it were planted with Citron-trees, and Orange-trees,
and stock'd with Cattle. 'Tis true, it hath no fresh water, but what falls from the sky,
which in all likelihood is the reason that seldom any touch at it, though there come thither
such store of Sea-wolves, that in a few dayes there might be as much fat gotten, as
would load a Vessel of 600 Tun.
               These creatures are called Sea-wolves,Sea-Wolves though they are more like Bears, both in colour,
and the making of their heads, save that the snowt of these is somewhat sharper. They
have only two paws under the breast, and draw the lower part of the body after them,
as if it were a taile, yet are they so swift, that it is as much as a man can do to overtake
them running.
               It is a cruel and fierce beast, which fears not to set upon two or three men together; and
his teeth are so close and strong, that he can therewith easily break the handle of a Patizan.
               There is also in the same place a kind of Badger,Badger. the flesh whereof is as delicate and wholsome
as that of Lambs; the birds call'd Pinguins, are there better and more tender then any
where else??? and in regard few Ships come thither, these birds and some others, are

so tame and so little afraid of a man, that he needs only put out his hand to take them.
               The 16th. The wind was contrary, we being at 32. degrees Latitude. The next day,
and the 18. with a North-north-west, and South-west wind, we got 64. Leagues, and
came to 29. degrees, 16. minutes Latitude.
               The 19. With a good South-south-west vvind, vve got 40 Leagues to the North-west,
and were at 28 degrees Latitude.
               The 20. With a South-east wind, we got 34 Leagues, continuing the same course to
the North-west.
               The 21th. 28 Leagues, with the same wind, and keeping on the same course.
               The 22th. 20 Leagues, with the same wind, and in the same course.
               The 23th. 24 Leagues, with the same wind, taking our course West-north-west.
               The 24th. We got with the same vvind, 30 Leagues, continuing our course to the
West-north-vvest.
               The 25th. We had so great a calm, that vve advanced not any thing at all.
               The 26th. We got but 20 Leagues, vvith a little East-south-east vvind, continuing
the same course.
               The 27th. We got 36. Leagues, vvith a North-east vvind, pursuing the same course,
and vvere come to 21 degrees Latitude.
               The 28th. With the same vvind, and holding the same course, vve got 46. Leagues,
and vvere at 20 degrees Latitude.
               29th. With an East-north-east vvind, vve got 20 Leagues, continuing the same
course.
               The 30. Keeping the same course, to the North-vvest, vve advanced 25 Leagues.
               October the first,OCTOBER a South-vvest vvinde put us forvvard 25 Leagues; keeping our course
to North-vvest, and vve got that day to 17 degrees Latitude.
               The 2. With the same vvind, vve got 25 Leagues, keeping on in the same course, till
vve vvere come to sixteen degrees, sixteen minutes Latitude.
               The 3d. With the same vvind, and in the same course, 28 Leagues.
               The 4th. With the same vvind, taking our course to the vvest 20 Leagues.
               The 5th. In the same course, 16 Leagues.
               The 6th. We got 15 Leagues vvith a South-east vvind,St. Helen's Island. and came that day to the Island
of St. Helene.
               This Island lies at 16. degrees, 12 minutes, beyond the Aequinoctial, and vvas so
called by the Portuguez,Planted by the Portuguez upon its being discovered the one and tvventieth of May, on
vvhich day is celebrated the memory of Saint Helene, Mother to Constantine the Great.
It is distant from the Coast of Angola 350. Leagues, from that of the Cape of Good hope
550. and from that of Bresil 510. So that it is somevvhat strange, that at so great a distance
from the continent, the Sea should start out an Island about 7 Leagues in compass. It
is so fertile, that there is not any Province in Europe affords such plenty of excellent
fruits, and breeds so many creatures as this Island.
               Some affirm, it afforded neither, vvhen it vvas first discovered by the Portuguez, and
that the fevv Trees they planted, and the little stock of Cattle they left there, hath so
furnished it, that it is able sufficiently to refresh all the fleets that come thither. At
this place, a man may have at any time of the year, Figs, Pomegranats, Citrons and Oranges,
and there are Goats, Swine, Barbary-Hens, Feasants, Partridges, Quailes, Peacocks,
Pigeons, and great store of all sorts of Birds, as also salt for the keeping of them; so that
Ships might be sufficiently provided with all things, if they would stay there any time.
The Sea supplies it with more Fish then can be consumed; and the Earth brings forth
so many excellent Herbs, that the Portuguez, unwilling to retard their Voyage, leave at
this place their sick men, who recover their health within a few days, and having only
a little Oyl, Rice, Bisket and Spice, make a shift to live there till the Ships come thither
the next year. Its Mountains are so high, that they reach above the Clouds, and are
seen at Sea, at the distance of 14 Leagues. The Trees wherewith they are covered bring
forth no Fruit, and are fit only for firing, but the Valleys are extreamly pleasant. The
King of Portugal would not have any establishment to be made there upon these reflections;
that all Ships passing that way might find refreshment there, and that it would be
a hard matter to keep the said Island against all the other Nations, who are concerned in its
being still free, inasmuch as were it not for that, Vessels many times, would be forc'd upon
the Coasts of Guiny, where water is not to be had at all times, and where they should be
obliged to stay for Rain, which would be so great an inconvenience that many of
the men would in the mean time droop and die.
               
                  
The fertility of this Island proceeds chiefly from the daily rain which falls there: but
they are transient showrs soon over, so that the Sun shining presently after, and that by
intervals, it must needs very much advance the maturation of all things.
               There are three places where fresh water may be taken in, to wit, where the three Rivers,
which come out of the Mountain fall into the Sea. They breed abundance of Snakes;
but the Dutch eat them, and prefer them before Eels.
               At 190 Leagues,Ascension Island. North-west of the Island of Saint Helene, is that of the Ascension,
so called by the Portuguez, upon its being discovered upon Ascention-day. It lies at 8.
degrees, 30. minutes South of the Line, and hath also very high mountains; but it affords
no fresh water, nor any other refreshment; nay, it hath not so much as any verdure; only
what may be particularly said of it, is that upon the Coasts of it, there are more Fish
then upon those of Saint Helenes, which occasions the coming thither of abundance of
Birds, that live only upon the said Fish. These Birds are somewhat like Geese, at least
as the Relations describe them. Assoon as a Vessel comes near, there flie such numbers
thereof into it, that they are easily kill'd with sticks, but the meat of them is not good.
The Earth of its Mountains is of a reddish colour, much like that which the Spaniards
call Almagro, from the name of a City, where there is much of it found.
               October 9. The South-east wind continued, but so weakly, that we got that day
but 15. Leagues, holding our course to the South-west, and we were at 16. degrees, 11.
minutes Latitude.
               The 10. We had a great calm, with insupportable heats, so that we got that day bu
8. Leagues, keeping the same course.
               The 11. With an Easterly wind, and keeping on the same course, we got 15. Leagues.
               The 12. We got 21. Leagues with the same wind, taking our course to the North-north-west.
               The 13. The wind came to North-east, and helped us forward 25. Leagues to North-north-west,
to 14. Degrees, 25. minutes Latitude.
               The 14. With the same wind, keeping on the same course, we advanced 22. Leagues.
               The 15. The wind came to South-east, and keeping on the same course, we advanced
44. Leagues.
               The 16. The wind continued South-east, and we got 46. Leagues; we had that day the
Sun in the Zenith, so that we could not observe the Elevation. The heats were very
great.
               The 17. We got 40. Leagues, with the same wind.
               The 18. With the same wind, we got 42. Leagues, to the fifth degree of Latitude.
That day we saw Millions of flying fishes, and abundance of those birds the Portuguez
call Mangas de Veludo. The heats were excessive.
               The 19. With a South-east wind, we got 40. Leagues, and got to 3. Degrees, 19
minutes Latitude.
               The 20. With the same wind, we got 40. Leagues further, and at one degree, 18.
minutes Latitude.
               The 21. VVith the same wind, we got 35. Leagues, and passed under the Aequinoctial
Line. At one degree beyond the Line lies the Cape de Lope Gonsales, upon the Coasts of
Guiny, the Road whereof is very good. There Vessels take in refreshments, in case they
had not done it at Saint Helene's Island.
               The Island of Saint Thomas,St. Thomas Island. so called by the Portuguez, from its being discovered on
21th. of December, lies under the Line. Though there be no talk of any Plague at
that place, yet is the air thereof very unwholsome, and prejudicial to strangers, who cannot
well bear the excessive heats predominant there; Whence it comes, there are few graybeards
seen there, and few Christians reach 50. years of Age, though the Inhabitants of
the Country live to above a hundred. Day and Night are of an equal length there all
the year long, and it rains only in March and September: but all the remainder of the
year, the Earth is moistened by a certain Dew, which brings forth all sorts of fruits.
They who discovered the Island found it overgrown with a kind of trees, the branches
whereof were all streight. Heretofore there grew Sugar there, in such quantities, as that
there was enough to load thence yearly above forty Ships: but it is now sometime since
that there bred there a kind of Worms, which so gnaw the Canes, that the Island can
hardly furnish six Ships therewith. It affords much Wheat, and Wine, Millet, Rye, Barley,
Melons, Cowcumbers, Figs, Ginger, red-Parsnips, Cabbages, Navews, Lettice, Parsly,
all sorts of Roots, Pulse, and Pot-herbs, and among others, a certain Root named Ignaman,
accounted a very delicate dish by the Inhabitants. It is a kind of Toadstool,

the rinde whereof is black, and the meat white, about the bigness, and not unlike
the French Navew, save that it casts forth several branches below. It is baked in the Embers,
and tastes somewhat like, but much better then a great Chesnut. The Spaniards
have planted Olive-trees there, as also Peach-trees, and Almond-trees, which grow well
enough, but bear no Fruit.
               Among the living Creatures,Land Crevisses. particularly to this Island, there is a kind of Crevisses, which
live within the ground, and work like Moles. There is also abundance of Partridges,
Quails, Black-birds, Parrats, and other Birds: but particularly great store of excellent fish,
especially VVhales, which are of a monstrous bulk, upon the Coasts of this Island.
               In the midst of the Island, there is a Mountain covered with Trees, and over-spread
with a Cloud, which supplies it with fresh water, and that abundantly enough to water
the Sugar Canes: but what is most remarkable is, that the higher the Sun comes over the
Horizon, the more water falls from the said Cloud.
               The natural Inhabitants of it are Negroes,The Inhabitants. but Forreigners continue white to the third
and fourth Generation; and it is reported, that the lice and fleas, wherewith the Negroes
are extreamly troubled, meddle not with the white people, inasmuch as the skins of the
former are much more delicate then those of the latter.
               VVithin 35. Leagues of St. Thomas Island,Rolles-Island. South-ward, there is another Island, which
the Portuguez. call Rolles Island. wherein there are Oranges, Citrons, Bananas, Ananas,
Ginger, Poultry, Swine, and other refreshments, in such plenty, that having besides a very
good Haven at ten Fathorn water, it is a more commodious place then the Cape de Lope
Gonsales.
               The Island of Carisco,Carisco-Island which lies 30. minutes on this side the Line, hath no other refreshment
but fresh-water, and is so neer the Continent, that seldome any Ships Anchor
there, but in great extremity.
               October 22. VVith a South-west wind, we got 33. Leagues, and about noon, were at
one degree, 35. minutes Latitude, North from the Line, having very fair weather.
               The 23. The same wind brought excessive heats, and advanced us 26. Leagues and 3.
degrees, one minute Latitude.
               The 24. VVe got but 22. Leagues, having continual thunder and lightning, which
lasted till night.
               The 25. The same South-east wind carried us 32. Leagues, taking our course North-North-west;
The weather was rainy, with storms, and those winds which the Portuguez
call Travados, which are very ordinary towards the Coasts of Guiny, from which we conceived
our selves to be then distant about 150. Leagues.
               The 26. The wind continuing South-east, we got 25. Leagues, and were at seven
degrees Latitude. The heat was much greater here, then it had been on the other side of
the Aequinoctial, though the Sun were ten degrees further from our Hemisphere, in as
much as the Sun, which had so lately warmed the Septentrional Hemisphere, had not
yet had time to warm the Meridional.
               The 27. The wind changed and came to North and by East, which obliged us to
change our course. We got that day but 13. Leagues, and about noon, were at seven
degrees, 50. minutes Latitude. And as we came further off from the Coasts of Guiny, we
accordingly removed out of the bad weather, which had much incommodated us before.
               The 28. The wind came to North-east, which is ordinary in those parts within the
10th. and 20th. degrees, whereas from thence it changes, as it does on our Seas on this
side. We got that day 30. Leagues.
               The 29. The same wind carried us 31. Leagues; and at noon, we were got to 10 degrees
Latitude. The next day, with the same wind, and keeping on the same course, we
got 28 Leagues, to 11. degrees, 13. minutes Latitude. The next, with the same wind,
the weather rainy, 23. Leagues.
               November 1. The same wind continuing, we advanced 26. Leagues.
               The 2. The wind North-east, we got 24. Leagues, holding our course to the North-west.
               The 3. We kept on,November. with the same wind, the same course, and were, about noon, at
14. degrees, 40. minutes, and consequently near the Latitude of Capo Verde, which is a
point of the Land reaching from the Continent of Africk into the Sea,Capo Verde. between the Rivers
of Gambea and Sanaga, by Ptolomy called Promontorium Arsinarium.
               The Inhabitants are black,Its Inhabitants. bulky and well-shaped, but mischievous and dangerous. They
are for the most part Pagans, whereof some invocate the Moon, and others adore the Devil,
whom they call Cammat??. Some among them profess themselves to be Mahumetans;
but all they have of that Religion is only the name and Circumcision.
               
                  
They are in perpetual wars with their Neighbours, and are expert enough at the mannagement
of their Horses,Their Arms which are brought them out of Barbary, and very swift. Their
Arms are the Bow, and a kind of Lance or light Pike, which they handle very advantagiously.
The most illustrious marks of their Victories are the Privy parts, which having
cut off from their Enemies, they present them to their Wives, who dispose them into
Neck-laces, and account them a greater Ornament then Pearls.
               They marry several Wives,The women do all the work whom they force to work like Slaves, as well in the fields
as at home, where the Husband is served up alone, with what his Wife hath provided
for him; and as soon as he hath din'd, he reassumes his Arms, and goes either a hunting, or
about his business. The Women are accustomed to such hardness, that as soon as they are
delivered, they go and wash the Child, either in the Sea, or the next River.
               The Men are for the most part much subject to drunkenness,The men drunkards. and such lovers of Wine,
that some have been seen to take off a Bottle of Aqua vitae at a draught. Their times of
debauches are, at the Funerals of their Friends, at which they spend four or five dayes together
in weeping and drinking by intervals, so that they seldom part ere they get their
Skins full of Drink. The Entertainments are performed with the Drum and Pipe, and
there is set at the head of the deceased a Pot of Wine or Water, which is changed twice a
day, and that for several years afterwards.
               They believe the dead will rise again,Believe the immortality of the soul. but that they shall be white, and trade there as the
Europeans do. The French, Spaniards and Dutch, trade much there in the Hides of Oxen,
Bufflers, and Elks, Elephants teeth, Wax, Rice, Ambergreece, which is excellent there. Here
it was that Peter de la Brouck, a Dutch Merchant, bought in the year 1606. a piece of Amber
of eighty pound weight.
               We shall here say by the way,D. urique discovers Guiny. that the Portuguez began their discoveries of this Coast
of Africk, in the year 1417. in the reign of Iohn I. who had been Master of Avis, under
the direction of the Infanto D. Eurique his third Son. These first Voyages had not
the success he expected, till that in the year 1441. Anthony Gonsales, having discovered
the Cape del Cvellero, brought away with him certain Negroes, whom the Infanto sent to
Pope Martin V. desiring him to promote the Zeal he had for the advancement of Christian
Religion, and to bestow on him the places he should discover upon those Coasts, which he
pretended were prossessed by such as had no right thereto.
               The Pope was pleased to make him a Present of what cost him nothing, and gave him
all he should discover in Africk, especially in those parts towards the Indies, upon condition,
that at his death he left them to the Crown of Portugal. The Infnte had discovered
all the Coast between Capo de Naom, as far as a hundred Leagues beyond Cabo Verde, and
died in the year 1453. King Alfonso V. in the year 1457. bestowed all these Conquests
on D. Ferand, Duke of Viseo, Heir to the Infanto D. Eurique, and in 1461. the same King
ordered the building of a Fort in the Island of Arguin, for the safety of Commerce, by
Suero Mendez, which the King D. Iohn II. caused to be rebuilt, before his coming to the
Crown, as Lord of those Conquests, and the Commerce of Guiny, by gift from the King his
Father. This Prince, in the year 1461. farm'd it out to one named Ferdinand Gomez, upon
condition he should every year discover a hundred Leagues of the Coast; so that in the
year 1479. they had discovered the Islands of Fernando del Po, St. Thomas, Anno Bueno,
those of del Principe, and the Cape of St. Katherine. The wars which happened between
the King D. Alfonso, and the Crown of Castile, hindred him from spending his thoughts
on these Conquests; but the King D. Iohn II. being come to the Crown, sent away in
December 1481. Diego d' Azambuja, who came to Mina, Iannary 19. 1482. to a place
called then Aldea de dos partes, and where reigned at that time a King, or Prince, named
Caramansa.
               This place,The scitution of Mina. on which the Portuguez bestowed the name of Mina, by reason of the abundance
of Gold found there, is seated upon the Coast of Guiny, five degrees, forty minutes
South of the Aequinoctial Line, between the Kingdoms of Axen and Cara, where within
the space of fifty Leagues is carried on the trade of almost all the Gold in those parts. It
hath on the North-west Comana, and on the North-east Afuto, small Countries, subject to
those of Abarambues. The Fort is built upon an ascent, which the scituation of the
Country makes by little and little at the end of a skirt of Land, which advances into the
Sea like a Peninsula, having on the North-side the Aethiopian Sea, and on the South a
little River, which serves it for a Ditch. It may be easily kept by five hundred men,
and the Town, which is at the foot of the Fort, hath about eight hundred Inhabitants.
But this place is so fenny and barren, that such as have settled themselves
there upon the account of Traffick, are forc'd to buy Provisions of those of Camana and
Afuto.
               
                  
The Inhabitants are docile enough, and better natured then the Negroes, though not so
rational as to matter of Religion.The Religion of the Inhabitants. They make Divinities of all they see, that's new and
and extraordinary. They had at that time enclosed with a Wall a great Tree, which they
adored, and to which, on certain dayes, Water and Meat was served up by one of their
Priests, whom they call Sofo. They had also a veneration for the Bones of a Whale, and
religiously worshipped a certain Rock, for this reason, that it was higher then any other
near it. No Nation in the World is more superstitious about groundless Divinations and
Augury,Their Superstitious. then this is. They take certain pieces of Straw into their mouths, and according
to their falling to the ground they judge ofthe event of things. They all affirm, that
they speak to the Devil, and they have a particular respect for such as have the reputation
of Sorcerers, but indeed are only Cheats and Impostors, who make their advantages of the
weakness of the besotted multitude.
               They are very religious in the observance of their Oaths,Religious in their Oaths. as being perswaded, that such
as violate them small dye suddenly, and alledge to that purpose, the examples of some of
their Nation, who having broke the Oath they had taken, not to injure some holy persons,
who preach'd the Gospel in those parts, were all destroyed. From this sincerity, there arises
an advantage not known elsewhere; which is, that Law-suits and differences are decided
in a few hours, upon the pure affirmation of the parties. No Crime so heynous, but a
man may redeem his life with money, unless he be so lost to goodness, as to fall several times
into the same offence.
               They go naked,Their Clothing. and cover only those parts which are not with decency to be named;
and they do it with Ape-skins, or pieces of Cloath of divers colours, which they make
of their Date-trees. The Ornament they most affect is, to make their Bodies shine by
frequent rubbing them with Oyl, or Fat. Persons of Quality wear Bracelets of Gold about
their Armes and Legs, and tye up their Hair and Beards with small Chains of the
same Metal.
               In their wars, they observe neither Order nor Discipline, and the Instruments they make
use of,Their Arms. are fitter rather to excite laughter, then animate them to fighting. Their defensive
Arms are made of Lions, Tigers, or Leopards skins, and the offensive are Darts, and short
Lances. Their Hidalgos, when they go to the wars, are attended by two Pages, whereof one
carries the Buckler, and the other a little Stool, on which the Master rests himself when
any halt is made.
               They regulate the number of their Wives according to their Revenue; and they contract
Marriages without any Ceremonies, giving the Brides Father only ten Rials for his
Wine, which they are such lovers of, that many times they take of it, till they have lost
their Senses and Understanding.
               The Dutch have there the Fort called Boure,The settlement of the Dutch in Guiny. within four Leagues of Mina. They have
also their Factors at Cara, Coromantin, and Aldea del Tuerto, and they quietly drive on the
trade of Mina, where they return yearly above two millions of Gold, and by that means
get out of the Iazans, and other Inhabitants of Aethiopia, great quantities of Gold; especially
since their settling at this place occasioned the Portuguez to attempt what they did
at Brasil, contrary to the Treaty they had made with the States of the Vnited Provinces.
The Dutch had already destroyed the trade of the Portuguez there, upon this score, that
they were content with a moderate profit, and treated the Negroes with so much mildness,
that they brought them to some liking of their Religion, which hath made a considerable
progress among them.
               Christopher Colombo, perceiving King Iohn II. to be much inclined to those Voyages
went to the Court of Portugal, to proffer his service, for the discovery of the West-Indies.
But the business being taken into consideration at the Councel, they thank'd Colombo, and
resolv'd to prosecute their Conquests in the East. In pursuance of this resolution, the King
sent away two of the best Pilots in the Kingdom, named Diego Can, and Iuan Alonso d'
Avero.
               The former took his course to Mina,Diego Can discovers the Kingdom of Congo. and arrived at the Cape de Lope Consales, and afterwards
doubling that of St. Katharine, he entred the River Zaire, seven degrees South of
the Line, and there took possession of the Kingdom of Congo.
               This Kingdom reaches from the Cape of St. Katherine Southward, as far as Cape de Ledo,
and hath on the West,The Kingdom of Cong. the Aethiopian Sea; on the South, the Mountains of the Moon, and
the Cafres; on the East, the Mantabas; and on the North, the Kingdom of Beny, being
in length about a hundred and sixty Leagues, from the second degree, 30. minutes, to the
13. degree beyond the Line.
                     s Provinces It consists of six great Provinces, named, Bamba, Sengo,
Sunda, Pango, Batta and Pambu.
               
                  
The Province Bamba reaches along the Coast, from the River Ambrisi, to that of Coanse;
the Metropolis,Bamba. Bamba, lying between the Rivers of Losa and Ambrisi, 30. Leagues from
the Sea.
               The Province of Songo lies upon the Rivers of Zaire and Loango,Songo. reaching from the River
Ambrisi, to the Mountains which divide it from the Kingdom of Loango. The Metropolis
is of the same name.
               The City of Sunda does also derive its name to the Province,Sunda. whereof it is the Metropolis.
It is 8. Leagues in compass, and comprehends under its jurisdiction all the Country,
which is near the City of Congo, (by the Portuguez named St. Salvader) as far as
the River Zaire.
               The Province of Pango,Pango, which had heretofore its particular King, hath on the North,
the Province of Sunda; on the South, that of Batta; on the West, the City of Congo;
and on the East, the Mountains of the Sun. The Metropolis, from which it hath the
name, lies upon the River Barbella, which hath its Source common with that of the
Nile.
               The Province of Batta lies North-eastward,Batta, between that of Pango, and the River Barbella,
and reaches to the burnt Mountains.
               The City of Congo,Pamba. is the Metropolis of the Province of Pamba, and lies upon a Mountain
fifty Leagues from the Sea. There is in the same Province, another Mountain which
is above six Leagues in length, and hath on it so many Villages and Hamlets, as find Habitations
for above a hundred thousand persons.
               Duarte Lopez,The Air of the Country who lived several years in those parts, and made a particular description
of the Kingdom of Congo, which Augustinus Cassiodorus hath taken the pains to translate
into the German language, affirms, that the Air is so temperate there in Winter, as it is in
Rome in October; and that the greatest annoyance to the Europeans, is the Rain, which falls
there every day, for two hours before, and as many in the afternoon, as being rather burning
then hot. Their Winter begins the 15. of March, and their Summer the 15. of September,
and during the moneths of April, May, Iune, Iuly and August, not a day passes, but it
rains, so that there is hardly a fair day in five moneths. But the dayes and nights are of
equal length in all seasons of the year.
               The River Zaire,The River Zaire. which rises out of the same Lake, where the Nile hath its Source, is
certainly the greatest River of any in Africk, in as much as having received into its
Channel, the waters of the Vambo, and the Barbella, it is 28. leagues broad at the mouth.
The River Goanze is a common Frontier between the Kingdoms of Congo and Angola; and
in the Lelonda, there are abundance of Crocodiles and Sea-horses.
               This last Creature is of a duskish colour,Sea-horses??? and hath very little hair; It is in the head like
a Cartal, without ears, hath broad nostrils, and in his jaws two teeth, like the Tusks of a
wild Boar. Its hoof hath the form of a three-leav'd-grass, and he neighs like a Horse,
and runs very swiftly. The Dutch in their Relations, affirm, that the Africans make
use of them, but avoid watering of them in Rivers, left they should overthrow their
Riders.
               From the hot Rains we spoke of proceeds the fruitfulness of the Country, which brings
forth Herbs, Fruit and Corn in so great plenty, that if the Inhabitants would but cultivate
the Ground, the World would not afford a better place.
               The Mountains in the Province of Pamba afford Gold,Gold Mines. and the Forrests thereof are full
of Elephants, which are so big, that some teeth have weighed two hundred pounds a piece.
There is also among others, a certain Creature called Sebra, which is like a Mule, save that
it is capable of engendring, and from the back-bone down to the belly, it hath three bars,
each of about three fingers breadth, whereof one is black, another white, and the third
yellow. This Creature is so swift, that the Portuguez, to express extraordinary swiftness,
instanee in the Sebra.
               The Empalenges is a kind of Oxe, but less and more fierce. The Forrests there are also
stored with Wolves, Foxes, wild Bufflers, wild Goats, Deer, and Conies, whereof there must
be abundance, in regard they are never hunted, nor indeed any, but the Civet-cats, which
they tame and keep,Serpents. for the advantage made of them. It is reported there are also Serpents
fifteen foot in length, which have such wide throats, that they swallow down Creatures entire.
There are Amphybia, but not venomous, for the Inhabitants eat of them, and prefer
their flesh before any Venison. There are others on the contrary, so dangerous, that such
as are stung by them die within twenty four hours.
               They have also all sorts of Birds, as Pheasants, Partridges, Hens, Turky-cocks, Ducks,
Geese. Turtles, Pidgeons, and all kinds of Hawks and Eagles.
               The Mountain of the Province of Pemba brings forth all sorts of Fruits, and very clear

and wholsom Waters, and the Country thereabouts affords a kind of Wheat called Leuco,
not much bigger then Mustard-seed, but makes better Bread then any in our parts. It is
accordingly more esteemed, then that made of Rice or Turkey-wheat, which is left to the
poorer sort; Citrons, Oranges, and Bananas, are as common there, as in the Indies; but the
Tree yields them most Fruit is the Date-tree.
               There are two kinds of it,Cocos. for some bear Dates, other Cocos, whereof they make Butter,
Oil, Wine, Vinegar, Fruit and Bread, and yet they have withall their use in Physick, since
the juyce extracted from them is so great a cleanser of the Reins, that no person of this
Country ever complained of the Stone or Gravel.
               All Simples are incomparably better there then in any of our parts, as are also the Melons,
Cowcumbers and Pulse, which the Country brings forth in great plenty.
               No Mountain but is planted with a great number of Fruit-trees, and several others,
which keep on their verdant Liveries all the year long: or if they are barren without, they
fail not of yielding somewhat within, as Marble, Alablaster, Jasper, Porphyry, nay, some
Hyacinths, and particularly that white kind of Marble, which was heretofore so highly
esteemed by the Romans.
               The Inhabitants of the Country are Negroes, but the Women not so black as the Men.
Their Hair curls, but they have not so great lips, nor such flat Noses, as the other Moors.
It is particularly affirmed of those of Bamba, that they are so strong, they will at one blow
strike off the head of an Oxe, or cut a Slave in the middle.
               Their Houses are low,Their houses. narrow, and ill built, not for want of Materials, but Work-men,
in as much as there is neither Mason nor Architect among them, unless a many may
say, there is not any place in the World hath more, since every man builds his own
House.
               The same may be said of Physicians;They are all Arhitects and Physiions They all understand Medicine and Botanicks,
at least as much as they think necessary for the preservation or recovery of their
health. They cure Feavers with a little Sandall-wood beaten to powder, the Headach
by bleeding, and the Purge they take is only the Powder made of the Bark of
a certain Tree.
               They go most bare-headed,Their Clothing, save that some wear a kind of Hats made of Nut-shells, or
the Barks of Trees. Some also wear Plumes of Feathers, which they fasten to their hair
with a piece of Packthread; and as well Men as Women, put into their Ears very weighty
Rings of Gold, with Stones in them, and wear Iron, Tin, or Brass Rings or Plates, about
the Arms or Legs, though most of quality are cloathed after the Portuguez fashion. They
sleep on Mats, and eat upon the Ground, sometimes shuffling flesh, and fish, and fruits together
all into the same dish; but persons of quality are otherwise serv'd, and eat alone, having
Mats laid under the meat. They never do their necessities, but they lay a stick cross a
pit, upon which they sit for their greater ease.
               A man may guess at the Wealth of the Country,The wealth of the Country. by the abundance of Gold, Silver, Copper,
Cristal, Iron, and other Metals, which their Mines afford, but especially by the prodigious
quantity of Ivory sold there. There is also a great trade driven in Civet, and the
Portuguez and Spaniards buy there a great number of Slaves, whom they set at work in
the Mines of Peru, or the Sugar-mills at Bresil.
               Instead of Money,Their money. they use shells; whence it comes, that the King of Congo hath a Governour
in the Island of Londa, who hath the oversight of the fishing there, which is
of so much the greater importance, in that men find there, what is here sought, though
under another name, many times with the hazard of life, and the loss of honour and conscience.
               The King of Congo is so absolute,The obsolute power of the King of Congo. that he doth not only dispose of the lives and estates of
his Subjects, but also, there is not a person in all his Country can pretend a propriety to any
thing; so that if he were not yearly paid the tribute due to him, he might take all and satisfie
himself. He hath his Governours in all the Provinces, who have their residence in
the chief Cities.The Governour of Batta Minister of State. H priviledges. The Governour of Batta, being of the Blood-royal, is the first, not only
of all the Governours, but also of all the Ministers of State: and in that qualification, his
authority is so great, that none of the Councel will contradict any thing he proposes. The
King sometimes permits him to eat at his own Table, a priviledge he allows not his own
Sons; but when he receives that honour, he does not sit down, but stands all the time, He
hath also his Pipers and other Musitians, as the King hath, and he hath only the priviledge
of having within his Government, such Guards as make use of Fire-arms. He employes
them particularly against the Giaques, a people living upon the Nile, which makes incursions
into the Kingdom, and against which an Alarm is given in the Country, by discharging
of a Musket.
               
                  
The Province of Bamba is as it were a Cittadel to the whole Kingdom, in regard thence
come the best Souldiers. It can raise above forty thousand able men, with whom, yet those
of Batta, where they may raise above seventy thousand, are not to be compared; their
Swords which are brought them by the Portuguez, are as big as those of the Swisses, yet
they are so expert in the handling of them, as some among us are in handling ordinary
Swords. They also use Darts, and make their Bucklers of the barks of Trees.
               Their Armies consist only of foot,Their Armies and manner of fighting. and fight all at the same time, or if they be divided
into several Batallions, the General keeps in the midst of the Army, and commands, by
means of divers instruments, by which the other Commanders, whom they call Mani, understand
whether they are to advance or retreat, close, or open, turn to the right or left,
fight on, or desist. They have a kind of wooden Trumpets, which make a dreadful noise,
as do also their Drums, which are made of barks of trees, and covered with a skin, which
they beat with great sticks of Ivory.
               They have also an Instrument, made of plates of Iron disposed triangle-wise, which
they beat with ordinary sticks; and Elephants teeth made hollow, the noise whereof very
much animates them to fighting. The General causes to be brought into the Army a great
many of these Instruments, which he distributes among the inferiour Officers, who thereby
answer the Signal given them by the General.
               Christian Religion was introduced into the Kingdom of Congo,How Christian Religion was introduced there. by occasion of an Embassie,
which King Caramansa sent to D. Iohn II. King of Portugal, at the second Voyage
made by Diego Can into those parts. The chief Embassadour, whose name was Casuta,
being baptized in Portugal, the King sent him back with a Convoy of three Ships, under
the command of Gonsalo de Sonsa, who being come to Cabo Verde, died there of the Plague,
as did also Casuta. Ruy de Sousa, who succeeded his Uncle in the charge of General, was
forced to put in at the Port of Finda, in the Province of Songo, where the Dutch have now
a Factory, and where the Lord of Governour of the place, who was Uncle to the King, was
baptized with his Son, and all his Family. The King and Queen followed their example,
and were called Iohn and Eleanor.
               This design was prosecuted by King Emanuel, in the year 1504. but the discovery of
the Indies, and the advantages made in those parts, having occasioned the discontinuance
of the Voyages upon the Coasts of Africk, those foundations of Religion were neglected,
and the Dutch made their advantages thereof, to introduce the Protestant Religion into that
Country.
               Let us now see,The Kingdom of Beny. what became of Iuan Alonso  Avero, who left Portugal with Diego
Can. He discovered upon the same Coast of Africk, the Kingdom of Beny, between the
Mina, and the Kingdom of Congo. It is about fourscore Leagues in length, and fourty in
breadth, and about twelve Leagues or thereabouts from the Sea, a man may see the City of
Hugatoo, upon the River which the discoverers of it named Rio Fermoso: a little further
within the Countrey, the Metropolis, which derives its name to the whole Kingdom. Iuan
Alonso was no sooner arrived there, but the King of Beny made a Treaty with him, and
promised he would be baptized. But this Conversion, being without any motive either
of Faith, or knowledge of the Religion he was to embrace, it accordingly came to nothing,
as did also the Trade they intended to establish there; for it was soon quitted for
that of the Indies.
               As to Cabo Verde,Cabo Verde described. which Ptolomey calls Promontorium Arsinarium, and puts at ten degrees,
forty minutes, on this side the Line, we affirm it for certain, that it is at fourteen degrees,
twenty minutes, and lies between the Rivers of Zanaga, and Gambra, or Gambe, which
Ptolomey seems to call Durago and Stachiris. It is called also Promontorium Hesperium, from
its being so much towards the West, and lying over against the Islands, which the Ancients
called Hesperides: and it is called Cabo Verde, from the Trees and verdure, for which it is
remarkable: But though Ptolomey affirms these Rivers to be very little ones, and that their
Sources are hardly known, yet it is certain they rise out of two Lakes, whereof one is called
by Ptolomey, Paulus Chelonides, now the Lake of Goaga, and the other that of Naba. The
Inhabitants believe they have their rise from the Nile, but there is little likelihood they
should.
               Ptolomey gives no account of their falling into the Sea; but it hath been found since, that
the River Gambra, which runs throughout the Province of Mandiga, having received into
its Channel the waters of several other Rivers, which cross that Province, falls into the
Ocean, at thirteen degrees, thirty minutes: And that the Zanaga, changing its name several
times, though its course be not so long, but streight from East to West, loses it quite, at
fifteen degrees and a half, where it falls into the River Geny, which derives its name to the
Country we now call Guiny.
               
                  
Ptolomey's Tables discover, that he knew nothing of the people who live between these
two Rivers,The Inhabitants of the Cabo Verde. so that to speak pertinently of them, we are to credit the modern Relations,
which affirm, that the people called Budumeys are possest of the Eastern part of the Country,
and reach as far as Cabo Verde: The Foules, and Berbecines, are quarter'd further within
the Country, upon the River Zanaga, and more Northerly then the Ialofes, whereof
some are subject to the Foules, others to the Budumeyes. They call their King Breque, and
their Country is plain and fenny, but very fertile in Cattle, Wine, Cotton, Ivory, wild Fowl,
and Horses, by reason of the frequent inundations of the River. They have neither Gold
nor Silver, but abundance of Iron, whereof they make all sorts of Instruments, and Utensils.
The Air there is very wholsom, though there be no great change of Seasons. The
Inhabitants of Cabo Verde are accounted couragious, and they have learnt of the Zeneguezes,
their Neighbours,Are Pagans. the Art of mannaging Horses, as they have also Paganisme, which
they profess.
               They have this advantage over their Neighbours, that Justice is better administred among
them then elsewhere; that they proceed with greater prudence and secrecy about
publick Affairs, which concern the greatness and safety of the State; and that they impartially
dispose punishments and rewards. The Prince, when he makes choice of any for
his Council, regards principally their Age, and he bestows the place of Judicature on such
among them as have most experience, and are best acquainted with Affairs. These fit every
day to hear Causes, and decide Differences.
               They know nothing of our Military discipline,Their way of raising forces. but their way of making war hath
something particular in it, which is this: All that are able to bear Arms, are disposed into
several Regiments, and lodged in Quarters appointed for that purpose, under their Colonels,
whom they call Iugarases; so that as soon as there is any occasion, the Orders are dispatched
from Quarter to Quarter, and by that means a powerful Army is raised in a few
dayes, without any need of making new Levies; in as much as the places are kept for the
Sons of the Souldiers, who succeed their Fathers, and put the Prince to no charge, but
what he allows them by way of salary, since they bring their provisions and baggage along
with them.
               The names of buying and selling are not yet known among them: for having neither
Gold nor Silver coined, they truck and exchange all, as well among themselves as with
Forreigners. Their greatest Commerce consists in trucking of Hides and Slaves. Of these
they have only such as they take in war, which being many times civil among themselves,
they make the best advantage they can of them.
               They have among them some distinction of Nobility and Peasantry,Their Nobility. and call the former
Sahibibos, who are a kind of Knights, for whom they have a great respect, but not so much
as they bear the Grandees, whom they call Thubalas, out of which rank they chuse their
King, provided he be full thirty years of age.
               When the Portuguez discovered the Country of the Ialofes,The state of the Country when first discovered. there reign'd a very powerful
Prince, named Brabiran, who dying left three Sons, by two several Wives. By the
former, he had Cibitam and Camba, and by the second, who was the Widow of another
Prince, Father of Beomi, Biran, who was chosen King after the Fathers death. His two
elder Brethren, envying the greatness of that Prince, declared themselves so openly against
him, that Biran, who had great assurances of the affection and fidelity of Beomi, his Brother
by the same Mother, took him so much into favour, that he seem'd to have reserved
to himself only the name of King. But that extraordinary favour prov'd fatal to both;
for Biran was kill'd by his Brethren, and Beomi, who thought to make his advantage of
that Fratricide, to get himself chosen, took up Arms against the two Brethren. He got together
a considerable Army; but being afterwards forsaken by his Friends, he was forc'd
to apply himself to Portugal for relief. King Iohn II. having got him instructed in the
Christian Religion, had him baptized with all his Family, and sent him back with a considerable
Fleet, under the conduct of Pedro Vaz de Cogna, whom he ordered to build a Fort
at the mouth of the River Zanaga, it being his design to get further into Africk, as far as
the Country of Prester Iohn, whereof he had but a confused knowledge. But that great
design proved abortive, and miscarried at the beginning, through the cowardice of Pedro
Vaz, who minding his convenience more then his honour, demolished the Fort he had newly
built, and not able to endure the just reproaches which Beomi made him upon that occasion,
he kill'd him with his own hands, the King of Portugal not expressing the least resentment
of so base an action.
               The Islands, which the Portuguez call As Ilhas Verdes,The Green Island. and the Dutch, the Salt-Islands,
lye over against Cabo Verde, and were not discovered by the Portuguez till the year 1472.
Some are of opinion, they are the Gorgonides of Ptolomy: but I dare not affirm, that that

great Person, who hath left us so confused an account of that Coast of Africk, knew any
thing of these Islands, whereof the nearest is 70. and the most remote 160. Leagues distant
from the Continent. They reach from the 15. to the 19. degree, and are in number
ten, to wit, St. Iago, St. Antonio, Santa Lucia, Sant. Vincenle, St. Nicholas, Ilha blanca,
Ilha de sal, Ilha de Mayo, Ilha de Eogo, and Ilha de Boa Vista. It is probable, the Portuguez
gave them the general name of Ilhas Verdes, or the Green-Islands, either from the
Cape we spoke of before, or from the verdure which floats upon the water in those parts,
and which the Portuguez call Sargasso,Sargasso. from its resemblance to Water-cresses. The Sea is
so covered there with, from the twentieth to the twenty fourth degree, that they seem to be
floating Islands, intended to block up the passage of Ships. Nay, this Herb is so thick
thereabouts, that, without a pretty strong Gale of wind, it would be no easie matter to
pass that way. Yet can it not be fai whence the said verdure comes to that place, where
the Sea hath no bottom, there being not any but in those parts, at above a hundred and
fifty Leagues from the Coasts of Africk. They were desert and not inhabited, when the
Portuguez discovered them; but now they are cultivated, and bring forth plenty of Rice,
Millet, Abruin, or Turkish wheat, Oranges, Citrons, Bananas, Annanas, Ignaues, Potatoes,
Melons, Citruls, Cowcumbers, Figs and Raisins, twice a year. The Islands of Mayo,
de Sal, and de Boa Vista, are so stored with Cattle, that they load whole Ships thence for
Brasil. The same Islands yield also such abundance of Salt, that the Dutch have taken occasion
thence to name them the Salt-Islands. The same Portuguez brought thither Barbary,
and common Hens, Peacocks and Pidgeons, which are so increased there, that with the
Partridges, Quails, and other smaller Birds, whereof there is plenty, people may fare very
well, at an easie rate.
               There are also among others,Flamencos a kind of Birds, which the Portuguez call Flamencos, that
are white all over the body, and have wings of a lively red, near the colour of fire, and are
as big as Swans. They have, above all, abundance of Conies; and the Sea supplies them
with so much Fish, that, at all times, a man may find there many Portugal Vessels, fishing for
the provision of Bresil. Whence it may be inferred, they lie very conveniently for the refreshing
of such Ships as are bound for the Indies, in as much as going thither they may
easily put in at the Island of Mayo, and coming thence, at that of St. Anthony, so as the
Portuguez who live there cannot hinder them.
               The Island of St. Iago is the chiefest of them,St. Jago, as being the residence of the Governour
and Archbishop, whose spiritual jurisdiction extends not only over these Islands, but also
over all the Portuguez are possessed of, upon the Coasts of Africk, as far as the Cpe of
Good hope.
               November 4. With a North-east wind we got 24. Leagues,The Voyage continued. keeping our course to the
North-north-west, and were got to 16. Degrees, one minute Latitude.
               The 5. With the same wind 31. Leagues, to 17. degrees, 27. minutes.
               The 6. With the same wind, and in the same course, 34. Leagues, to 19. degrees, 10.
minutes.
               The 7. The wind continuing North-east, we got 36 Leagues. Not that we had still
the advantage of the Manson, at the Latitude; but it is to be observed, that the North-east
wind reigns in those parts all the year long, and brings Vessels as far as the Artick
Tropick.
               The 8. The wind came East-north-east, and we run 32. Leagues, and were got to 22.
degrees, 35. minutes Latitude. Here we met with abundance of Sargasso, which I really
found like Cresses, save that it was of a more yellowish green, and had little seeds, like those
of green Goosberries. Some are of opinion, that the wind forces it from the Rocks upon
the Coasts of the West-Indies; but this is the more unlikely, in that the North-east wind
reigns there all the year long, as we said before.
               The 9. The same wind continuing, we got 33. Leagues, taking our course to the North,
and were at 24. degrees, 32. minutes Latitude.
               The 10. With the same wind, 25. Leagues, taking our course to North-north-west, at
25. degrees, 40. minutes Latitude.
               The 11. The wind came to East-south-east, and afterwards to South, and towards evening,
to North-west, with a great Calm; so that we got that day but eight Leagues,
changing our course from North to West, at twenty six degrees, forty minutes Latitude.
That day we took one of those Fish the Dutch call Haye, which are very common
in the Indies; but our Sea-men affirmed they had never seen any of them in that
Sea.
               The 12, We got 11 leagues with a North-east wind, keeping our course to the North-west.
               
                  
The 13. With a North-north-east wind, we got 21. leagues, taking our course West-north-west.
               The 14. With the same wind, and in the same course, we got 22. leagues.
               The 15. The wind North-east, we got 20. leagues to North-west, at 27. degrees, 30.
minutes latitude.
               The 16. and 17. With the same wind, keeping the same course, we got these two dayes
32. leagues.
               The 18. The wind South-east, we run 21. leagues, to the North-west, at 29. degrees,

               The 19. The wind chang'd, and came to South-south-west, and brought with it Rain,
which lasted all day; yet so as we advanced 37. Leagues, taking our course North-east.
               The 20. The wind, North-west, we got 12. Leagues, in the same course.
               The 11. The same wind carried us 22. Leagues.

               The 26. Being calm weather, we got but 13. Leagues.
               The 27. We got but 12. Leagues, taking our course East-north-east, at 38. degrees, 48.
minutes Latitude.
               The 28. The wind came to South-south-east, and carried us 27. Leagues, taking our
course East-south-east.
               The 29. The wind South-south-east, we were at noon, at 33. degrees, 30. minutes. We
saw the Islands of Corvo, and de Flores, which some number among the Assores; and we
got that day 24. Leagues, taking our course East-south-east.
               The Islands of Corzo and Flores,The Aores. are not to be numbred among those which the Spaniards
call the Assores, by reason of the many Hawks found there, when they were discovered.
The Dutch call them the Flemmings Islands, hence, that the first Inhabitants of the
Island of Fajal, which is one of the seven Assores, were Flemmings, either born in Flanders,
or some other Province of the Low-Countries, where they speak Low-Dutch. The Posterity
of those Flemmings live there still, and observe the Customs of their own Country,
and have their habitations on the little River rising out of the Mountains, which the Portuguez,
upon that occasion, call Ribera dos Flamenos.
               The seven Islands called the Assores,Tercera. are Tercera, St. Michael, Santa Maria, So, Georges,
Gratiosa Pico, and Fajal. Tercera is the biggest of them all, as being fifteen or sixteen
Leagues in compass. The Country is mountainous, and all the Island is so encompassed
with Rocks, that it is in a manner inaccessible.
               It hath no Haven, but that at the City of Angra, which is the Metropolis, not only of
Tercera, but also of all the other Islands, and that no Rode where Vessels might safely
ride.
               The Port of Tercera is like a Crescent between two Promotories, whereof one hath
two Mountains advancing so far into the Sea, that they seem to be quite loosned from the
Island.
               They are called Bresil??? and so high, that a man may from thence discover twelve or thirteen
Leagues into the Sea. The Governours of the Assores, and the Bishop of all those
Islands, live in the City of Angra, within three Leagues whereof lies that which they call
Villa da Praya, which is well built, but not very populous, in as much as it is a place of no
Commerce, by reason of a flat shore or strand thereabouts, which occasioned the name of
the City.
               The City of Angra is so called from the manner of its scituation,Angra it being a term whereby
the Portuguez would express the Figure of the Mount when it is half open, or the
New-moon. It hath two Forts, whereof one which is towards the Mountains, serves it
for a Cittadel; and the other, called the Castle of Saint Sebastiant, is built upon one of the
points, which shut up the Port, which it defends with the Artillery. On the other point
which is forked, there are two Towers, whence they give the signal, as soon as they discover
any Vessels at Sea, either from Fresil-side, or from Europe.
               These Islands belong to the Crown of Portugal; but during the last troubles of that
Kingdom, there was a Castilian Garrison there, under the Command of D. A. Alvaro de
Vizeros; from whom the Portuguez soon took the Castle of Saint Sestastian; but he

kept the Cittadel, till famine, and the utmost extremity forced him to deliver it up, on composition,
May 6. 1642. After the relief which had been sent from Saint Lucars, Corogno,
and Dunkrk, had proved ineffectual, partly through the treachery of the Portuguez, who
served in the Fleet, and partly by their vigilance, who had possess'd themselves of the Avenues
of the Island.
               The soil of it is very good, nay the very Rocks yield Wine, though they are in some
places so steepy, that it is almost a miracle how the Rock should thrust out of its Veins,
which are not covered with Earth, the Vine-stock, which does not thrive so well in the
best parts of the Valley. 'Tis true, the Wine is none of the most excellent, and that such
as are able to get better, have it brought from Madera, or the Canaries: but this hinders
not, but it may be affirmed, that Salt and Oyl only excepted, which are brought thither
from Portugal, this Island hath not only what is necessary, but also what may be accounted
delicacy, since that, besides the Wheat whereof, there is sufficient to maintain all the Inhabitants,They  good Fruit.
they have Apples, Pears, Citrons and Oranges, but especially plenty of Peaches,
and of all the kinds thereof. They have also Cherries, Plums, Walnuts, and Chesnuts,
but not such quantities thereof, as of other Fruits. Nor do they want any Pulse, or Potherbs.
               They have also a Fruit they call Battatas,Battats  Potatoes. which spreads its root just under the uppermost
Superficies of the Earth, as the Vine does, and brings forth a Fruit much like a Raddish,
save that it is much bigger, there being some Roots that weigh a pound or more. It
is much esteemed in Portugal, but in the Island it is of no account, so that only the poorer
sort live on it. They have also a certain Plant which grows up five or six foot high, and
is fastned to the Earth by an infinite number of Roots, yellow as Gold, and as small as the
Hair of Mans Head. The Inhabitants use it instead of Wooll and Feathers, to fill their
Beds and Mattresses withall: but would they take the pains to spin it, they might make
very good Stuffs thereof.
               Cattle is extreamly multiplied there, as also all the several sorts of Poultry brought
thither, and there are abundance of Quails, and such multitudes of little Birds, like
the Canary Bird, that some of the Inhabitants trade in nothing else. But there is neither
wild Fowl nor Venison, and consequently no hunting, nor any divertisement of
that kind, though there be Forrest enough, which might be sufficiently stored in a short
time.
               The Wheat there is very good,Their Wheat will not keep. but will not keep, in so much, that they are forc'd to put
it under ground, to preserve it to the end of the year. Whence it comes, that every Family
hath a pit in some part of the City, the entrance whereof was so big, that a man may go in,
into which they dispose their Wheat, seal it with the mark and seal of the Owner, and
leave it there till Christmass, and then they have it conveyed to their Houses, and put it into
Chests of Bull-rushes, where it keeps the remainder of the year, so as that there is no need
of ever stirring it.
               There is no Province in Europe,Tercera Oen very large. where Oxen are so fair, and so strong, as in the Island of
Tercera, or have fairer and larger Horns; and they are withall so tame, that they impose
names upon them, as we do on Dogs, that they may go or come when they are
called.
               To hear the noise which the Rocks make when people go over them,Is  Earthquakes. as if they were going
over a Cellar, a man would think the Island were all hollow; and its probable, that
the Air which is raified in its Concavities, occasions the frequent Earthquakes, whereto it
is subject, as are also most of the other Islands. There happened so great a one in this of
Tercera, on the 24. of May, 1614. that it overturn'd, in the City of Angra, eleven Churches,
and nine Chappels, besides private houses; and in the City of Pray, it prov'd so
dreadful, that there was hardly a house left standing: and the 16. of Iune 1028. there
happened so horrible an Earthquake in the Island of Saint Michael, that not far from it,
the Sea opened,An Island started of  sudden. and thrust forth at a place, where there was above a hundred and fifty
fathom water, an Island above a League and a half in length, and above sixty fathom
high.
               There are also, in these two Islands, certain places, out of which there issues forth a sulphurous
smoak, whence it may be inferred, there is fire hidden under the earth, that gives
heat to the Springs of scalding water, which are to be seen thereabouts.
               There is a Spring within three Leagues of Angra,A Spring that petrifies wood. which petrifies Wood; whereof there
is an evident demonstration in a Tree, the root whereof is absolutely petrified, as far as it
was covered by the water, whereas otherwise it is not changed at all.
               In the Island of Pico,A kind of wood hard as Iron. there is a certain Wood called Texio, which is as hard as
Iron, and being cut, is full of Waves like Chamlet, and as red as any Scarlet. The

Cabinets made of this Wood are so highly esteemed, that the Wood is kept for the Kings
use.
               Cedar is so common,Cedar. that they do not only make all sorts of Houshold-stuffe thereof, but
also Waggons and Boats; Nay, sometimes it serveth for firing.
               The Trade of these parts is not very great; for, Woad only excepted, whereof they
make great quantities in these Islands, the Inhabitants have few other Commodities to
Trade withall; unless it be some provisions, which they sell to the Ships that are bound
for the East-Indies, and take in refreshments at these places, in their way.
               The Island of Saint Michael,St. Michaels Island. whereof we spoke before, lies at twenty seven or twenty
eight Leagues, South-east, from the Island of Tercera, and is above twenty Leagues in
length.
               Its Metropolis is called Punta Delgada, and its Soil is incomparably more fertile then that
of the other, and produces such plenty of Wheat, that it is able to relieve its Neighbours.
There are made yearly in this Island above two hundred thousand Quintals of Woad,
wherewith the Inhabitants drive a great trade, though it hath neither Haven nor Road,
where Ships may ride secure from all wind.
               Twelve leagues South from that of Saint Michael,St. Maries Island. lies the Island of Saint Mary, which
is about ten or twelve leagues in compass, and affords only Provisions, and Potters-earth,
wherewith the Inhabitants trade into the neighbouring Islands.
               The Island Gratiosa is not above five or six Leagues in compass,Gratiosa Island. and lies North-north-east
from that of Tercera, from which it is about seven or eight leagues distant. The pleasantness
of it, and the Fruits which grow there in great abundance, occasioned its having
that name given it.
               The Island of Saint George lies about eight or nine Leagues North-west from that of
Tercera,St. Georges Island. and is twelve leagues in length, and two or three in breadth. It affords plenty
of Provisions, but little Woad. The Country is rough and full of Mountains, which yeild
great store of Cedar, wherein the Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade, with the Joyners
of Tercera, where most Tradesman have settled themselves, in regard there it is the
Ships put in, and that they can best put off their Commodities.
               Seven leagues from Saint Georges Island,Fayal Island. to the South-west, lies the Island of Fayal, which
is seventeen or eighteen Leagues in compass, and is no doubt the best of all the Assores,
next those of Tercera, and Saint Michael. The Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade in
Woad, as also in Provisions and Fish, whereof they carry whole Caravels loaden, to the
Island of Tercera, where they are distributed among the Fleets which put in there. Its
Metropolis is called Villa Desta, where live those who are Originally Flemmings, as we said
before.
               Pico Island,Pico Island. which hath its name from the high Mountain within it, called Pico, and
which is conceived to be as high as that of the great Canary, whereof we shall speak
anon, lies three Leagues South-east from the Island of Fayal, four South-west of that of
Saint George, and twelve West-south-west of that of Tercera. The Inhabitants live
by their Cattle and Tillage, the earth answering their expectations, and requites the
pains they bestow on it, as being more fertile here, then in any of these seven
Islands.
               The Island de Flores,The Island de Flores. whereof we spoke before, and which we discovered the 29. of
November, is seventy Leagues distant from that of Tercera, more to the West, and consequently
so far from these Islands, that it is unjustly numbred among the Assores, or Flemmish
Islands, as is also that of Coruo, which is distant from that of Flores, about a League to
the North; though both are subject to the Crown of Portugal, and submit to the Governour
of Tercera. Flores Island is about seven Leagues in compass, and affords some Woad,
but not much.
               The Portuguez are so much the more jealous of the preservation of these Islands, the
more convenient they lye,The convenience of these Islands. for the relief and accommodation of such Ships, as are bound
for the East-Indies and Brasil. Whence it comes they permit not Strangers to compass the
Island of Tercera, which serves for a Cittadel to all the rest, (which have no Haven, where
Vessels may ride secure as to all winds, nor any fortified place for a retreat) least they should
discover the weakness of the Island, and take notice of those places where people might
land. Before the English became Masters of Iamaica, their Ships kept for the most part
between the Assores and the Island of Flores, and there waited for the Fleet, which comes
every year from the Havanna for Spain.
               The Air is very healthy in all these Islands,The Air very sharp in the Assores. but so piercing, that in very few years it consumes
Iron and Stones. Whence it comes that ordinarily they use in their buildings, the
Flints, which they find by the Sea-side, under water, in regard they better bear the sharpness
of the Air.
               
                  
The wind coming to the South,1640. we kept on our course to the North-east, leaving the
Islands of Flores and Corvo East of us, so that we soon lost sight of them.
               But ere we prosecute our Voyage,The anaries. we shall here take occasion by the way to speak a
word or two of the Canary Islands, which lye upon the Coast of Afri, near the
Streights of Gibralter.
               They were discovered in the year 1342.When discovered. The Ancients called them Insulae Fortunatae,
by reason of the wholsomness of the Air, and fertility of their soil. They are seven, to
wit, Lanzarotta, Forientura, the Great Canary, Teneriffa, Gomera, Fierro and Palma, and
reach in a manner upon the same Line, from East to West.
               They who affirm that the Discoverers thereof gave them the name of the Canaries,
from their finding many Canes or Dogs there are mistaken. For it is certain, that as
well Pliny and Solius, as Ptolomey name one of these fortunate Islands Canaria,
though the two former give the others very different names from those we find in Ptalomy.
               So that it may probably be said that Canaria being the biggest of all the Fortunate
Islands, derived its name to all the rest of them, as that of Tercera communicates
its name to all the Assores, and Flauders its name to all the Low-Countries; and
Holland its, to all the  under the States General.
               About the year 1348. Lewis, Count of Clermont,Lewis Count of Clermont conquers them. Son of D. Aloso dela Cerda, sirnamed
the Disinberited, made ready a Fleet upon the Coasts of Catalonia, under the
protection of Alpbnso King of Aragn, with a design to go and take possession of the
Canary Islands; which the Pope hold bestowed on him, conditionally he would
cause the Gospel to be preached to the Barbarious, by whom those Islands were inhabited.
               He could not go along with their himself by reason of the Wars in France, and the
battle of Crecy, at which he was in the service of King Philip of Valois; Yet so as this
hindred not, but that the Conquest of them was made in his name and he was called the
Fortunate Child.
               About the end of the same Age the Besques and Adoluzians??? having made an agreement
among themselves for the division of these Islands which had been forsaken ever since the
death of D. Lewis de la crda set forth certain Vessels, and surprized the Island of Lanzaa,
when they brought so much. wealth, that the King of Castit had even then attempted
the Conquest of these Islands, had not the Wars, he was ingaged in with his
Neighbours, hindred him.
               Some time afterwards, Iohn de Betancourt, a French Gentleman made a Voyage thither,A French Gentleman conquers them by commission from the King of Casteel;
with A Commission from Henry III King of Spain; provided, that after the Conquest
thereof, he should acknowledge the Kings protection, and do homage for the same to the
Crown of Castile, He took the five lesser Islands, but the Inhabitants of the two greater
ones defended themselves so well, that he was forc'd to sit down with his former Conquest.
The King of Castile being thus Sovereign thereof, sent thither a Bishop, to instruct
the Islanders in the Christian Reigion; but Betancourt's Nephew, who had sucdeeded
his Uncle, not able to brook any Authority that might eclipse his own, would
needs drive him thence, and grew so high, that the King was forc'd to interpose in their
difference. He sent??? thither; one named Pedro Barba, who became Master of them,
to his use, and sold them afterwards to one named Peraza, who gave them upon a
Conact of Marriage to his Son-in-Law, named Heera. This last assumed the quality
of King of the Cories; but not able to conquer the two greate Islands, he sold
four of them to Ferdinand??? King of Aragon, surnamed the Catholick, and reserved to
himself only the Island of Gomera, with the quality of Count. King Ferdinand, who
was the most fortunate of any Prince in his time??? sent a Fleet thither, and conquered also
the two greater Islands, for the Crown of Castile,
                      of Castile. whereto they have belonged ever
since.
               The Great Canary hath above nine thousand Inhabitants, and among others a Bishop,Great Canary.
the Inuisition, and the Councel, which governs and the other Island. From the excellence
of its Wine, which is much beyoud that of Spain, a man may judge of the fruitfulness
of the Country, which produces Wheat, Barley, Honey, Wax, Sugar-Canes, Cheese
and Woad in great abundance, and breeds such  of Cattel, that the Leather sold there
is not one of the least Commodities the Inhabitants trade in not only with those of Sevil,
and several other Cities of Spain, but also with the English, Dutch, Hamburgers, and other
Nations of Europe, especially the Speniards, who bound for the West-Indies, take the most
of their refreshments at this place.
               
                  
In the Isle of Teneriffe there is a Mountain,Teneriffe. called El Pio de Terraira. It is certainly
the highest Mountain in the World, since that a man cannot get it up in less then three
dayes, and that must be too either in Iuly or August, in as much as all the year besides, it
is covered with Snow, though there never fall any in those Islands. It is so high, that it
may be seen at the distance of sixty Leagues, and from the top of it, a man may discover,
and easily count all the other Canary Islands, though some of them be above fifty leagues
distant from this.
               The Island of Fierro is also one of the most considerable of all the Canaries,Fierro Island. and I conceive
that name to be given it upon this account, that its soil, not affording so much as a
drop of fresh water, seems to be of Iron. And indeed there is in this Island, neither River,
nor Rivulet, nor Well, nor Spring, save that towards the Sea-side there are some
Wells, but they lie at such a distance from the City, that the Inhabitants can make no
use thereof. But the great Preserver, and Sustainer of all, remedies this inconvenience
by a way so extraordinary, that a man will be forced to sit down and acknowledge,
that he gives, in this, an undeniable Demonstration of his Goodness and infinite Providence.
               For,A miraculous tree. in the middest of the Island, there is a Tree, which is the only one in its kind, in as
much as it hath no resemblance to those mentioned by us in this Relation, nor to any other
known to us in Europe. The leaves of it are long and narrow, and continue in a constant
verdure, Winter and Summer, and its branches are covered with a Cloud, which is never
dispelled, but resolved into a moisture, which causes to fall from its leaves, a very clear
Water, and that in such abundance, that the Cisterns, which are placed at the foot of the
Tree, to receive it, are never empty, but contain enough to supply both men and
beasts.
               Some affirm, that above a hundred leagues West of the Canries, there is sometimes seen
an Island, called St. Borondon, which, they say, is very delightful and fertile, and inhabited
by Christians; yet can it not be said, what Language they speak, nor how the Island came
to be peopled. The Spaniards of the Canaries have often endeavoured to find out the
said Island; but whether it be that it is alwayes covered with a thick mist, which hinders
it from being discovered, or that the current of the water thereabouts was so strong, that
it is a hard matter to land thereat; certain it is, that as yet, it subsists only in the opinion
wherewith most Sea-men are prepossessed, that, certainly there is an Island in those
parts.
               The 30th. of November,The Voyage continued. the wind South-south-west, we got 31. leagues to the North-east,
and were at noon got to 40. degrees, 32. minutes Latitude.
               December 3. With the same wind we got 34. Leagues,DECEMBER. taking our course North-east.
               The 4. The wind North-east, carried us twenty seven Leagues, to East-north-east.
               The 5. The wind came to South-west, and continuing the same course, we got 34.
leagues. This day it was just eleven moneths that we had been tossed up and down the
Sea; for we left Surat the 5. of Ianuary, though our Voyage had been prosperous enough
ever since our departure from the Island of Madagear.
               The 6. The same wind was heightned into a tempest, but having it Easterly, we got 50.
leagues that day.
               When a man is once come to the Azores,The West-wind  from the Azores to England. he may assure himself all the year after of
a West-wind, which will bring him into England, and never almost turns to South or
North, though it may sometimes vary some points of the Compass from one side to the
other.
               The 7. The wind came to the North-west, and we got 39. Leagues to East-north-east.
               The 8. The wind turn'd to South-west, and was so high, that we got 47. leagues, keeping
on the same course.
               The 9. The wind South-south-west, we got 31. leagues, to North-north-east. We
were this day at 49. degrees, 13. minutes. It was very cold, and we found bottom at 68.
fathom, the Sand very white.
               In the evening we founded again, and found some change in the Sand, which was yellower
then that in the morning, at fifty three fathom water. The wind changed at night,
and coming to North-east, was just in our teeth.
               The 10. About noon, the wind came to South-west, and we found we had got 22.
Leagues.
               
                  
The 11. At break of day we saw two English Vessels, and soon after, we discovered on
our left hand, that point of England which is called The Lands end, and in the County
of Cornwal. The wind was against us, which oblig'd us to endeavour doubling the
point by Laveering. We made shift to get that day 16. Leagues.
               The 12. The wind still contrary, we continued Laveering. We saw another English
Vessel, but could not come near it.
               The 13. The wind South-west, and South-south-west; we continued our course to
East-south-east, and to East, with a point towards the South. We got that day 64.
Leagues, and were at 49. degrees Latitude.
               Then we chang'd our course,Come into the Channel taking it to East-north-east, to get into the channel
which divides England from France.
               The 14. we saw two Scotch Ships, and a Dunkirker. We came somewhat near them,
but the Sea made such a noise, that we could not possibly hear one the other.
               The 15. We continued our course to East-north-east, and met three Dutch Ships
bound for Brsil.
               That day we passed in sight of the Isle of Wight,The Isle of Wight. which lies at 50. degrees, 36. minutes
Latitude, and at 19. degrees, and 4. minutes Longitude.
               The 16. About 10. in the morning we passed in sight of Dover-Castle,Dover. and at noon
came to the Downs. We cast Anchor near three men of war which lay at Anchor in
the same Road; and thus we compleated our Voyage, in the 12. month after our departure
from Surat.
               There were in the same Road above a hundred other ships lying at Anchor, in expectation
of some change of weather, which was then so boystrous, that for two days
we could not get out of our Ship. The Lord Admiral who commanded the Men of War,
ventured to send his Shallop to our Ship, to congratulate the Presidents safe return.
               The 19. The wind being somewhat laid, the Admiral invited the President to dinner.
I went along with him, and participated of the civility wherewith he received him. I
must confess, I was somewhat surprised, to see upon the Sea such a prodigious quantity
of silver Plate; and a Table as well furnished, as that I may boldly say, the King
was not better served at London, then the Admiral was in his Vessel. We were so well
treated there, that night began to draw on ere we got away.
               Our Ship was not above a Musket shot from the Admiral's but we were no sooner
got into our boat,
                      like to be cast away in the Haven. ere there rose such a Tempest, as not only hindred us from getting
aboard, but forced us to Sea, the waves so filling our little Vessel, that we were forced
to cast out the water with our hats.
               In the precedent part of this Relation, the Reader may have observed, that we had
been in many great dangers ere we got to the Coasts of England; but certain it is, that
we were then in, was far greater then any we had escaped; since we were in all probability
to perish in fight of our dear Country, and to be wrackt in the Port, whereto we
were already arriv'd. We were above four hours in these extremities, and at last we
discovered a little Vessel, which had lost all its Anchors but the last, which was not so
fastned, but that the wind forc'd it towards the Sea. We were in water up to the waste,
but that hindred us not from setting our selves to the Oares, so that with much adoo we
got to the said Vessel. Assoon as we were got into it, we found that it was as unsafe to
be there, as to continue in our own; in regard the Anchor being not able to stay it, we
were in danger of being cast on a certain bank, which is one of the most dangerous of
any about that Coast. And indeed, we should hardly have recovered our selves out of
that fear, had we been in a condition to reflect on the danger we were in: but the cold
we had endured, the good chear we had made, the salt water we had swallowed down in
our boat, and the violent and extraordinary motion of that little Vessel, put us so out
of order, that we were better then half dead, when we were brought the next day to our
Ship, where we were received as persons risen from the dead, inasmuch as all who had seen
our boat carried away by the violence of the winds, had given us over for irrecoverably
lost; nay, so far did they despair of ever seeing us again, that they had already bewailed
our death.
               December 24. There rose so dreadful a Tempest,Another tempest. Canterbury. that in the same Road, which is accounted
one of the safest and best in the World, 24. Ships, were forc'd to cut off their
Masts. We were our selves put to the same extremity, but not so much by reason of the
violence of the winds, as to avoid the running upon us of two men of War, which were
got loose from their Anchors, and would otherwise have run foul upon ours.
               
                  
The 26. We got ashore, and reach'd that night to Canterbury,Canterbury. the Cathedral whereof
is without doubt the noblest of any in England, and may be compared with the best
structures in the World.
               The 27. We came to Gravesend;Come to London. the 28. to London, where certain Deputies of the
East-India Company expected the President in eight Coaches at Black-wall. There came
along with them the President's Lady, whom he had not seen in seven years before. He
would needs have me salute her, according to the English way, and obliged me to take up
my lodging at his own house, and to participate of all the honours done him upon his
arrival.
               December 30. I went to see the East-India House, and thank'd the Overseers there for
all the civilities I had receiv'd from the President. They invited me to the entertainment
which they made that day for him.
               The next day,IANV. S. Edmund Wright. and the 1. of Ianuary, we were at other treatments, and Ianuary 2. the
Lord Major sent to invite us. He was so pleased with the Presidents discourse, that he
prevail'd with him to come again the next day. The Lord Major was indeed himself very
excellent for discourse, and having heard what dangers he had escaped in that great
Voyage, he would shew us that they were not to be compared with such as some others
had been in. He gave us the story of a Dutch Sea-man, who being condemned for a crime,
his punishment was changed, and he was ordered to be left in St. Helens's Island, a place
we have spoken of before. This unhappy person representing to himself the horrour of
that solitude much beyond what it really was, since it came not near that we shall have occasion
to speak of anon, fell into a despair, that made him attempt the strangest Action
that ever was heard of.
               There had that day been interr'd in the same Island an Officer of the Ship:A strange attempt of a Duch marriner. This Seaman
took up the body out of the Coffin, and having made a kind of rudder of the upper
board, ventured himself to Sea in it. It hapned fortunately to him, to be so great a
calm, that the Ship lay as it were immoveable, within a League and half of the Island;
but his companions seeing so strange a kind of boat floating on the water, imagined they
saw a Spectre, and were not a little startled at the resolution of the man, who durst hazard
himself upon that Element, in three boards slightly nail'd together, which a small
wave might have overturned, though he had no confidence to be received by those, who
had so lately sentenc'd him to death. Accordingly it was put to the question whether
he should be received or not, and some would have the sentence put in execution; but
at last, they concluded in mitiorem, and he was taken aboard, and came afterwards to
Holland, where he lived in the Town of Horn, and related to many, how miraculously
God had delivered him.
               Whereto the Lord Major added, that it was a great mistake in the said Sea-man, to take
so desperate a resolution, upon pure thoughts of the solitude of that Place, since the
Spaniards leave their sick there from year to year, to recover themselves of the inconveniences
of their long Voyages, and that he could give them an example, which condemned
the fortunate temerity of that man, whom fear caused to do what the most resolute
courage would never have attempted.
               In the year 1616. a Flemming named Pickman,An example of a dreadful solitude. well known in England and Holland,
for the Art he had in getting out of the Sea the great Guns of that Spanish Fleet, which
was forc'd upon the Coasts of Ireland and Scotland, in the year 1588. coming from
Dronthem in Norway, with a Vessel loaden with boards, was overtaken by a calm, during
which, the current of the Sea carried him upon a Rock or little Island, towards the extremities
of Scotland, where he was in some danger to be cast away. To avoid a wrack,
he commanded some of his men to go into the Shallop, and to tow off the Ship. These
having done so, would needs go up into a certain Rock to look for Eggs; but assoon as
they were got up into it, they at some distance perceived a man, whence they imagine
there were others lay lurking thereabouts, and that he had made his escape thither to
avoid some Pirats which might surprise their Ship: so that they made all the haste they
could to their Shallop??? and returned to their Ship. But the calm continuing, and the
current of the Sea, driving the Vessel against that Island, they were forc'd to get into
the long boat, and tow her off again. The man they had seen before was in the mean
time come to the brink of the Island, and made signs to them with his hands, intreating
them to come nearer, and falling on his knees, and joyning his hands together, begg'd
relief from them. At first, there was some difficulty made; but coming nearer the Island,
they saw something, which was more like a Ghost, then a living person, a body stark
naked, black and hairy, a meagre and deformed countenance, and hollow and distorted
eyes, which raised such compassion in them, that they proffered to take him into the

boat; but the Rock being so steepy thereabouts, that it was impossible to land, they
went about the Island, and came at last to a flat shore, where they took the man aboard.
They found nothing at all in the Island, nor grass, nor tree, nor ought whence a man could
derive any subsistance, nor any shelter, but the ruines of a boat, wherewith he had made
a kind of Hut, under which he might lye down, and shelter himself from the rain and
injuries of the weather.
               The Sun was set ere they got to the Ship, and immediately, there rose a wind, which
forc'd them off from the Island; whence they imagined that what they had brought with
them was not a man, since he had not the Figure of one; whereupon they would know
of him who he was, and how he came to that uninhabitable place. He made answer,
He was an English-man, and that about a year before, being to pass in the ordinary passage
boat from England to Dublin in Ireland, they were taken by a French Pirate, who being forced
by the Tempest which immediately rose, to let go the passage boat, left us to the mercy of the
waves, which carried us between Ireland and Scotland into the main Sea, expecting to be
cast away every minute, as at last we were. For the bark being split against the Rock where
you took me in, I escap'd with one of my comrades into the Island, in a more wretched condition,
then if being swallowed up by the Sea, we had been delivered out of the extremities we
were in for want of meat and drink.
               Of some of the boards of our boat, we made the Hut you saw, and we took some Sea-mews,
which we set a drying in the wind and Sun, and so eat them raw. We found also, in the
erevices of the Rock, upon the Sea-side, some Eggs, and thus had we wherewithal to subsist,
as much as served to keep us from starving??? but what we thought most insupportable, was thirst,
in regard the place affording no fresh water, but what fell from the sky and was left in certain
pits, which Time had made in the Rock, we could not have of it at all seasons, by reason the
Rock being small, and lying low, the waves came over the Island, and fill'd th pits with
salt-water. We lived in that condition six weeks, comforting one another, and finding some
ease in our common misfortune, till that being left alone, it began to grow insupportable to
me. For one day awaking in the morning, and missing my comrade, I fell into such a despair,
that I had some thoughts of casting my self down headlong, and so putting a final period
to that affliction, whereof I had endured but the one half, while I had a friend divided it with
me. I know not what became of him, whither despair forc'd him to that extremity; or whether
getting up in the night, not fully awake, he fell into the Sea; but I am of opinion, he
fell in through carelesness, as he looked for Eggs in the crevices of the Rock, which as you
saw was very steepy, on that side; Inasmuch as having observed no distraction in him, I cannot
imagine, he should of a sudden fall into that despair, against which he had fortified himself
by continual and earnest prayers. I lost, with my comrade, the knife wherewith we killed the
Sea-dogs, and the Mews, upon which we lived; so that not able to kill any more, I was reduced
to this extremity, to get out of one of the boards of my Hut a great nail, which I
made a shift so to sharpen upon the Rock, that it served me for a knife. The same necessity put
me upon another invention, which kept me the last winter, during which I endured the greatest
misery imaginable. For finding the Rock and my Hut so covered with Snow, that it was
impossible for me to get any thing abroad, I put out a little stick at the crevice of my Hut;
and baiting it with a little Sea-dogs fat, I by that means got some Sea-mews, which I took
with my hand from under the Snow, and so I made a shift to keep my self from starving.
               I lived in this condition and solitude above elevon months, and was resolved to end my
days in it, when God sent you hither to deliver me out of the greatest misery th ever man was
in.
               The Sea-man having ended his discourse, the Master of the Ship treated him so well
that within a few dayes he was quite another creature. He set him ashore at Derry in
Ireland, and saw him afterward at Dublin, where such as had heard what hapned to
him, gave him wherewithal to return into England.
               Thus the Lord Major made us acknowledge, that in all we had suffered, there was
nothing extraordinary, and that long Voyages, are never without great dangers and inconveniences.
He urged it to us, that as Ships are now built, and considering the knowledge
men have of the course taken for the Indies, there is no more danger in those long
Voyages, then in such as are made in the sight of Land, which Sea-man fear most.
               To this purpose he related a story, wherein we could no less admire the strange Resolutions
of two men, then the goodness of God in their deliverance beyond all expectation.
               Four Christian slaves being in the Ship of an Algire-pirate,A strange resolution of two Slaves resolved to make their
escape in a boat, which one of them, who was a Carpenter, undertook to build. The
Carpenter set himself on work about making on woodden Pins, and other pieces necessary
for the fastning of the boards, whereof the boat was to consist.
               
                  
The Turkish Captain asked him one day what he did, and was satisfied with the Answer
the other made him, that it was only to avoid being idle, and to have things in
readiness to mend the long boat, when need were. Having appointed a time for the execution
of their design, they took off five boards from the room, where the provision
was kept, whereof they used two for the bottom, two others for the sides, and the
fifth for the prow and the poop, and so made up somewhat that was more like a trough
then a boat. Their quilt served them for tow, and having pitcht the boat well, they set
it into the water: but when they would have got into it, they found that two men
loaded it so, that being in danger of sinking, two of the four desisted from an enterprise,
wherein they thought to meet with more danger, then in staying a while longer
among the Turks, so that only two, one English man, the other a Dutch-man, ventured
themselves in it. All the tackling they had was only two oars, and a little Sail; all the
provisions, a little bread and fresh water; and so they put to Sea, without either Compass
or Astrolabe; insomuch that being the first day overtaken by Tempest, which at every
wave fill'd their boat, they were forc'd to go as the wind drove them, without keeping
any course. They were continually imploy'd in casting out the water; the Sea had
spoiled their bread; and they were almost quite spent, inasmuch as they could not take
any rest, when they were cast upon the Coasts of Barbary. There they found a little wood,
wherewith they somewhat enlarg'd their boat; but they narrowly escap'd being taken and
kill'd by the Moors, and had much ado to get to Sea again. What troubled them most,
was thirst; but they made some shift for that, with the blood of some Tortoises they
took, and at last, after ten days floating up and down, they arrived upon the Coasts of
Spain, at the Cape of St. Martin, between Alicant and Valentia. Those of the Country
seeing them at a distance, sent a boat to meet them, carried them bread and wine, treated
them very civilly, and found them passage for England.
               The sixth of Ianuary, being Twelfth-day, the King of England touched many that
were troubled with the Evil. The Ceremony ended, my Lord of Strafford brought me
to his Majesty, who was pleased to honour me with the kissing of his hand. The
next day, the same Lord procured me the like Honour from the Queen; besides which
he did me several other extraordinary favours, upon all occasions. Afterwards I went
often to Court, where their Majesties were pleased I should entertain them with some
particulars of my Travels; especially as to what I had observed in Muscovy and Persia.
               I continued at London near three months, partly to refresh my self after so long a
Voyage, and partly in expectation of some mony from my own Prince, that I night
make some acknowledgments of my Obligations to those who had treated me so kindly,
from the day of my arrival at Surat to that time, and set my self in a posture of returning
into my own Country. Of the time of my abode in England, I spent some at Court,
where I had made several acquaintances, and some in viewing the publick and private
Structures of the famous City of London; as also several places near it; as among others,
Enfield, Tibulls, White-Hall, Saint Iame's, Hampton-Court, Windsor, Westminster-Hall,
and the Abbey, the Tower, Greenwich, &c.
               [Of the places above mentioned here in England, as also some of those he
passed through in the Low-Countries, the Author gives a short description.
But in regard what he says of the former, is known to most English-men, who
are in any measure acquainted with the things remarkable in their own
Country; and what he delivers of the latter affords no extraordinary satisfaction
to the curious, for whose diversion works of this nature are intended;
we thought fit to forbear the insertion thereof, that we might make the more
haste to bring him to the end of his Travels, which shall be done according to
his ordinary method.]
               March the 20.MARCH. I left London, Mandelslo leaves London. taking water at Graves-end, whence I went
to Rochester, and so came the twenty fourth to Dover. The next day, I embarked thence
for Dunkirk, whither I got the same day.
               
                  
The next, I embarked thence for Newport, where I stayed only one night, and got the
next day to Bruges.
               The 29th. I came to Gaunt, which I left the first of April, and got that night to Brussels
the chief city of the Dutchy of Brabant.
               At Brussels I staid two dayes, and came the fourth to Louvain, which I left the fifth, and
got the same day to Macchlin, about four Leagues distant from Louvain.
               The 6th. I left Macchlin, and came to Awerp, where having staid two dayes, and leaving
it the ninth, I got the next day to Breda, where I stayed only the remainder of it,
and went the next day to Bois-le-due, or Bolde, five Leagues from Bred.
               April the twelfth, I went to Saint Gertrudenberg, with an intention there to take boat
for Rotterdam, as I did the same day.
               The thirteenth I came to Rotterdam, whence I went the same day to Delf; thence
to the Hague, thence to Leiden, and thence to Haerlem.
               The City is the biggest of any in Holland, next Amsterdam, and pretends to the invention
of PRINTING, and would have the Glory of it due to one of its Citizens,
named Laurence Cster, who in the year M.CCCC.XX. framed the first Characters of
Beech-wood, and afterwards found out the Ink, now used by Printers, nay, changed
the Wooden Characters into Leaden ones, and afterwards those into Tine; in so much,
that in the year 1440. the Mystery was almost in its perfection.
               They are so fully perswaded, as to this in the City of Haerlem, that the Senate would
Eternize the Memory of LAVRENCE COSTER, by the Inscription set upon
the House he lived in.

               I left Haerlem, about six in the Evening, and came at nine the same night, to Amsterdam.
Of this place I had heard so much, even in the Indies, that I had framed to my self,
a certain Idaea of its greatness: but what the more surprised me, was, That going out
of my Lodging the next morning, I had much ado to get through the throg of people???

walking up and down the Streets, in such numbers, as if there had been some Faire.
All the other parts of the World seem'd to have sent their Factours thither, and that the
East and North had brought thither all their Commodities; whereof there were in the
ops  the Patterns, whereas the main Stock was disposed into Store-houses, publick
Weighing-places, upon sledges in the streets, upon the Kayes, in the flat-bottomed boats,
which unload the great Ships, and others which serve for Store-houses for the Wheat.
               It was at some los, which I should rather admire in that great City??? whether the
Commerce of it, which is greater then that of all the other Cities of the Low-Countries
put together; the neatness of its Streets, especially that of the New City; the sweetness and cleanlines of its house, the Magnificence of its publick and private
Structures; the abundance of Ships and Barks, which come thither, and go thenec every
day; the largeness of its Port, wherein there are at all times seven or eight hundred
Ships; or the Order and Policy observed by the Magistrate, in all things relating to
the  of the City, the well fe of its Inhabitants, and the improvement of Trade,
by which only the City subsists, and causes to subsist that powerful State, whereof it
is a considerable part.
               As to its Commerce there is no City in the world; where the Inhabitants of Amsterdam
have not their Factors and correspondents. All the maritime towns of England, France,
Spain, and Italy, are full of them, as are also those of the Baltick-Sea, and Muscovy it
self??? It is in a manner impossible to number the Ships it sends away every year to Archangel,
, to the Coasts of Pomerania, and into Norway
where they put off their Spics and Silk, and Woolen sfuffs; for Wheat, Timber, Pitch,
, and other things they stand in need of, either for the building of their,
ships and houses, or the carrying on of their Trade in the other parts of the world. These
Fleets go away commonly twice or thrice a year; but there go some every day West-ward,
and  hour, for the other Cities of Holland, and the Neighbouring Provinces; yet
 hinder but that  Ports and Clannells are so covered with boats and
ships, that it may be questioned, whether the water be not there as much inhabited as the
land, and whether there be more people in the houses or the ships. There is such abunof
Wheat, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Wood, and Spices, as if all other Provinces of the world
were emptied of their wealth, to make Amsterdam a publick Treasury of all they produce:
so that it may be said, it is in this City properly, that a man may see those Miracles,
which the famous Scaliger attributes to all Holland.
               Though a man should consider only the House belonging to the East-India Company,
he would  all its Inhabitants.
I ha 
                   some Ship 
                   at  the Store-houses,
and Magazeens reaching at a great distance, from the East-India House, full of Spices,
Silk, Stuffs  what ever China and the Indies afford that is most
 had sent thithe all its Ciamon;  all their Cloves; he Islands
of  all their Spices, China all its rich stuffs; Iapan its excellent
works of several kinds, and the rest of the Indies its Pepper and Silk. Nay, it may be
said this Company is a kind of particular Common-wealth in that little world; since
its Magistrates, Officers, Arntes, lets Generals, Governour of Provinces and Cities,
and its subjects, seem to have no other dependance on this City, then a particular State
hath on the Universe.
               It is since the year 1595??? that the Dutch have made Voyages into the Indies, upon
the instigation of a Merchant named Cornelius Hman, who living at Lisbon, informed
himself, from the Portuguez, of all the particulars of those Voyages, and prevailed
so far with some Merchants of Amsterdam, that in the year 1595. they sent out
four Ships, which thay sent along the Coasts of Africk, and the Cape of good Hope into
the Indies; inasmuch as the design, which some others had to find out a passage North-ward,
had not proved effectual. About two years and four months after these Ships
returned to Amsterdam; and though the profits of this first Voyage answered not the
expectations of the persons concerned, yet were they such as engaged several other Merchants
in the same design; so that in the year 1598. they sent thither a second Fleet,
consisting of ight great Ships. They would not stay the return of this Fleeet, but in
the year 159. set forth another, and much about the same time some other Merchants
made up a new Company, and set out a particular Fleet, insomuch as to prevent the
destruction of Trade likely to be occasioned by many different interests, the States of
the United Provinces, in the year 1602. brought the persons concern'd to an agreement

among themselves, and reduced them into one common Company, under their Authority,
and the direction of the Prince of Orange, as Admiral of those Provinces.
               By this Agreement, thus authorised by a Grant of the States for one and twenty years,
there was a regulation made, according to which the oversight of all that trade was put
into the hands of the chiefest persons concern'd therein, divided into six Chambers or
Courts, which were settled at Amsterdam; Middleborough for Zealand; at Delf and Rotterdam
for the Meuse; and at Horn and Enckhuisen for West-Friesland.
               The first consisted of twenty Directors; that of Middleborough of twelve, and the
four others of seven a piece, so that in all charges, that of Amsterdam bore the one half, that
of Zealand a quarter part; those of Meuse and West-friesland each a half-quarter. It was
also ordered, that to General Assemblies, that of Amsterdam should send eight Deputies,
that of Zealand four, and those of the Meuse and West friesland, each of them two, with a
supernumerary for a casting voice, which was to be appointed by the Chambers of Zealand,
the Meuse, and West-friesland alternately.
               The Stock of this Company amounted to six Millions six hundred French Livers,
which was laid out in the setting forth of several Fleets; and the first Voyages proved so
fortunate, that it was found in the year 1613. that the money of the persons concern'd
had gain'd two hundred and sixty upon the hundred. But the profits were much greater
the year following, as may be seen by the Dvidents which have been made from time to
time.
               In the house belonging to the same Company, I saw also all the Drugs, all the Fruits, and
all the living Creatures which I had seen before in the Indies.
               It were impossible to imagine any thing more delightful, or more regularly disposed then
the Streets, Water-channels, and Houses of this City. All the Rivulets are bordered with
Line-trees, and the Quays pav'd at the extremities with Brick, an in the middest with
Flint. The Houses, especially those of the new City, are so man Palaces; so neat without,
that painting could add nothing thereto, and so well furnish'd within, that there are
some, whereof only the Pictures were enough to enrich a man. But what most speaks the
cost imploy'd about them is least seen: For all the Houses being built on piles, it must be
confessed, the foundations are no less precious then the rest of the Structure, and that
there is not so noble a Forrest in the World as that which the City of Amsterdam hath under
its houses.
               Among the publick Structures the Churches are remarkable; and among others, those
called the Old and the New, and the three others built some years since by the Magistrate.
In the former is the Epitaph of Iacob de Heemskerk, who, having made two Voyages to
Nova Zembla, and the Indies, was kill'd at the Streights of Gibralter, where he set upon
the Spanish Fleet, within reach of the great Guns of the Fort.
               What a noble and neat place is the Hospital and Convent of St. George, where there are
now received great numbers of Aged persons of both Sexes, who are maintained there?
What more charitable, then the care and tenderness wherewith distracted persons are treated?
And what severity do they not exercise in the ordering of incorrigible persons; the
men in a House, over the door whereof there is in golden Letters,
               VIRTVTIS EST DOMARE, CVNCTI PAVENT.
               Where they are constantly imployed in sawing Brasil with inexpressible pains, or some
other work, according to the nature of the Crime for which they were sentenced to that
punishment; and the women in another house by themselves? But there is not any thing
so miraculous as the order observed there for the education of poor Orphans, who are
very well kept, maintain'd, and taught; as also in the administration of their Estates who
are under Guardians; these being obliged to give an account thereof to the Magistrate.
               
                  
The Exchanges of London and Antwerp are indeed noble places; but there is something
more magnificent in that of Amsterdam; at least this may be affirm'd of it, that for the
number of Merchants daily resorting thither at noon, neither of the other two is to be
compared to it.
               I may put also among the publick Structures, the Weighing places, the Gates of the City,
the three Sluces, which have not their like in the World; the publick School, or Colledge,
which the Magistrate hath opened there some years since; The Arsenal, the Theatre
for Playes, the Anatomy-Hall, the places appointed for shooting with Long-bow,
Cross bow, and the Arquebuse; and if I may be allowed to speak of a thing which is not
yet, but no doubt will be within a few years, and whereof I have seen the draught, I
mean the Town-house, or Guild-hall, I may boldly say there is not any in Europe comes
near it.
               I stayed at Amsterdam eight dayes, and finding something in that City which pleased my
fancy beyond what I had observed in any I saw before, I was unwilling to see any more,
but having my imagination full of it, I took shipping the twenty third of April for Hamborough,
whither I reach'd the twenty eighth following. I rested my self there one day,
