         To the Reader.
         COurteous Reader, be intreated to make a fauorable construction of my forwardnes, in publishing these inseuing discourses, the desire of carrying the Gospell of Christ, into those forraigne parts, amongst those people that as yet haue had no knowledge, nor tast of God, as also to procure vnto themselues and others a quiet and comfortable habytation:  amongst other things the inducements (vnto these vndertakers of the then hopefull, and now experimentally knowne good enterprice for plantation, in New England, to set afoote and prosecute the same & though it fared with them, as it is common to the most actions of this nature, that the first attemps proue diffecult, as the sequell more at large expresseth, yet it hath pleased God, cue beyond our expectation in so short a time, to giue hope of letting some of them see (though some he hath taken out of this vale of teares) some grounds of hope, of the accomplishment of both those endes by them, at first propounded.
         And as my selfe then much desired, and shortly

hope to effect, if the Lord will, the putting to of my shoulder in this hopefull business, and in the meane time, these relations comming to my hand from my both known & faithful friends, on whose writings I do much rely, I thought it not a misse to make them more generall, hoping of a cheerfull proceeding, both of Aduenturers and planters, intreating that the example of the hon: Virginia and Bermudas Companies, incountering with so many distasters, and that for diuers yeares together, with an vnwearied resolution, the good effects whereof are now eminent, may preuaile as a spurre of preparation also touching this no lesse hopefull Country though yet an infant, the extent & coÌ„modities whereof are as yet not fully known, after time wil vnfould more: such as desire to take knowledge of things, may in forme themselues by this insuing treatise, and if they please also by such as haue bin there a first and second time, my barty prayer to God is that the euent of this and all other honorable and honest vndertakings, may be for the furtherance of the kingdome of Christ, the inlarging of the bounds of our Soueraigne Lord King Iames, & the good and profit of those, who either by purse, or person, or both, are agents in the same, so I take leaue and rest
         
            Thy friend, G. MOVRT.
         
      
      
         
         CERTAINE VSEFVL ADVERTISEMENTS SENT in a Letter written by a discreete friend vnto the Planters in New England, at their first setting saile from Southhampton, who earnestly desiresh the prosperitie of that their new Plantation.
         LOuing and Christian friends, I doe heartily and in the Lord salute you all, as being they with whom I am present in my best affection, and most earnest longings after you, though I be constrained for a while to be bodily absent from you, I say constrained, God knowing how willingly and much rather then otherwise I would haue borne my part with you in this first brunt, were I not by strong necessitie held backe for the present. Make account of me in the meane while, as of a man deuided in my selfe with great paine, and as (naturall bonds set aside) hauing my better part with you. And though I doubt not but in your godly wisedomes you both foresee and resolue vpon that which concerneth your present

state and condition both seuerally and ioyntly, yet haue I thought but my dutie to adde some further spurre of prouocation vnto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet because I owe it in loue and dutie.
         And first, as we are daily to renew our repentance with our God, speciall for our sinnes knowne, and generall for our vnknowne trespasses; so doth the Lord call vs in a singular maner vpon occasions of such difficultie and danger as lieth vpon you, to a both more narrow search and carefull reformation of our wayes in his sight, lest he calling to remembrance our sinnes forgotten by vs or vnrepented of, take aduantage against vs, and in iudgement leaue vs for the same to be swallowed vp in one danger or other; whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest repentance and the pardon thereof from the Lord, sealed vp vnto a mans conscience by his Spirit, great shall be his securitie and peace in all dangers, sweete his comforts in all distresses, with happie deliuerance from all euill, whether in life or in death.
         Now next after this heauenly peace with God and our owne consciences, we are carefully to prouide for peace with all men what in vs lieth, especially with our associates, and for that end watchfulnes must be had, that we neither at all in our selues do giue, no nor easily take offence being giuen by others. Woe be vnto the world for offences, for though it be necessary (considering the malice of Satan and mans corruption) that offences come, yet woe vnto the man or woman either by whom

the offence cometh, saith Christ, Math. 18. 7. And if offences in the vnseasonable vse of things in them selues indifferent, be more to be feared then death it selfe, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 9. 15. how much more in things simply euill, in which neither honour of God nor loue of man is thought worthy to be regarded.
         Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep our selues by the grace of God from giuing offence, except withall we be armed against the taking of them when they are giuen by others. For how vnperfect and lame is the worke of grace in that person, who wants charitie to couer a multitude of offences, as the Scriptures speake. Neither are you to be exhorted to this grace onely vpon the common grounds of Christianitie, which are, that persons ready to take offence, either want charitie to couer offences, or wisedome duly to weigh humane frailtie; or lastly are grosse, though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teacheth, Math. 7. 1, 2, 3. as indeed in mine owne experience, few or none haue beene found which sooner giue offence, then such as easily take it; neither haue they euer proued sound and profitable members in societies, which haue nourished in themselues that touchey humour. But besides these, there are diuers spetiall motiues prouoking you aboue others to great care and conscience this way: As first, you are many of you strangers, as to the persons, so to the infirmities one of another, and so stand in neede of more watchfulnesse this way, lest when such things fall out in men and women as you suspected not, you be inordinately affected

with them; which doth require at your hands much wisedome and charitie for the couering and preuenting of incident offences that way. And lastly your intended course of ciuill communitie wil minister continuall occasion of offence, and will be as fuell for that fire, except you diligently quench it with brotherly forbearance. And if taking of offence causlesly or easily at mens doings be so carefully to be auoided, how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himselfe, which yet we certainly do so oft as we do murmure at his prouidence in our crosses, or beare impatiently such afflictions as where with he pleaseth to visit vs. Store we vp therefore patience against the euill day, without which we take offence at the Lord himselfe in his holy and iust works.
         A fourth thing there is carefully to be prouided for, to wit, that with your common emploiments you ioyne common affections truly bent vpon the generall good, auoiding as a deadly plague of your both common and speciall comfort all retirednesse of minde for proper aduantage, and all singularly affected any maner of way; let euery man represse in himselfe and the whole bodie in each person, as so many rebels against the common good, all priuate respects of mens selues, not sorting with the generall conueniencie. And as men are carefull not to haue a new house shaken with any violence before it be well settled and the parts firmly knit: so be you, I beseech you brethren, much more carefull, that the house of God which you are and are

to be, be not shaken with vnnecessary nouelties or other oppositions at the first settling thereof.
         Lastly, whereas you are to become a body politik, vsing amongst your selues ciuill gouernment, and are not furnished with any persons of speciall eminencie aboue the rest, to be chosen by you into office of gouernment: Let your wisedome and godlinesse appeare, not onely in chusing such persons as do entirely loue, and will diligently promote the common good, but also in yeelding vnto them all due honour and obedience in their lawfull administrations; not beholding in them the ordinarinesse of their persons, but Gods ordinance for your good; nor being like vnto the foolish multitude, who more honour the gay coate, then either the vertuous mind of the man, or glorious ordinance of the Lord. But you know better things, and that the image of the Lords power and authoritie which the Magistrate beareth, is honorable, in how meane persons soeuer. And this dutie you both may the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably to performe, because you are at least for the present to haue onely them for your ordinary gouernours, which your selues shall make choise of for that worke.
         Sundrie other things of importance I could put you in mind of, and of those before mentioned in more words, but I will not so far wrong your godly minds, as to thinke you heedlesse of these things, there being also diuers among you so well able to admonish both themselues and others of what concerneth them. These few things therefore, and

the same in few words I do earnestly commend vnto your care and conscience, ioyning there with my daily incessant prayers vnto the Lord, that he who hath made the heauens and the earth, the sea and all riuers of waters, and whose prouidence is ouer all his workes, especially ouer all his deare children for good, would so guide and guard you in your wayes, as inwardly by his Spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you and we also, for and with you, may haue after matter of praising his Name all the days of your and our liues. Fare you well in him in whom you trust, and in whom I rest
         
            An vnfained well-willer of your happie successe in this hopefull voyage, I. R.
         
      
   
   
      
         
            
            A briefe RELATION OF THE DISCOVERY AND PLANTATION of New England.
            ALthough it bee a course, farre from the minde of vs, that are vndertakers for the aduancement of the Plantation of New-England, to seeke by any vaine ostentation to extoll our owne endeuours: yet we cannot but striue to vindicate our reputation from the iniurious aspersions that haue beene laid vpon it, by the malicious practises of some that would aduenture nothing in the beginning, but would now reape the benefit of our paines and charges, and yet not seeme beholding to vs; and to that end they disualew what is past, and by sinister informations derogate what they can from the present course intended: the rather because the good Orders appointed to bee put in execution there, are likely to restraine the licentious irregularitie of other places. And this hath induced vs to publish our proceedings, whereunto it hath pleased God to giue a blessing: as to any of indifferent

               
               
               
               
iudgement may appeare by that which followeth.
            WHen this designe was first attempted, some of the present company were therein chiefly interessed; who being carefull to haue the same accomplished, did send to the discouery of those Northerne parts a braue Gentleman, Captaine Henry Challons, with two of the Natiues of that Territory, the one called Maneday, the other Assecomet. But his misfortunes did expose him to the power of certaine Strangers, enemies to his proceedings, so that by them, his company were seized, the ships and goods confiscated, and that Voyage wholly ouerthrowne.
            This losse, & vnfortunate beginning, did much abate the rising courage of the first Aduenturers; but immediately vpon his departure, it pleased the noble Lord chiefe Iustice, Sir Iohn Popham knight, to send out another ship, wherein Captain Thomas Haman went Commander, & Martine Prinne of Bristow Master, with all necessarie supplies, for the seconding of Captaine Challons and his people; who arriuing at the place appointed, and not finding that Captaine there, after they had made some discouery, and found the Coasts, Hauens, and Harbors answerable to our desires, they returned. Vpon whose relation the Lord Chiefe Iustice, and wee all waxed so confident of the businesse, that the yeere following euerie man of any worth, formerly interessed in it, was willing to ioyne in the charge for the sending ouer a competent number of people to lay the ground of a hopefull plantation.
            Here upon Captaine Popham, Captaine Rawley Gilbert, and others were sent away with two Ships, and an hundred Landmen, Ordnance, and other prouisions necessarie for their sustentation and defence; vntill other

supply might bee sent. In the meane while, before they could returne, it pleased God to take from vs this worthy member, the Lord Chiefe Iustice, whose sudden death did so astonish the hearts of the most part of the Aduenturers, as some grew cold, and some did wholly abandon the businesse. Yet Sir Francis Popham his sonne, certaine of his priuate friends, and other of vs, omitted not the next yeare (holding on our first resolution) to ioyne in sending forth a new supply, which was accordingly performed.
            But the Ships arriuing there, did not only bring vncomfortable newes of the death of the Lord Chiefe Iustice, together with the death of Sir Iohn Gilbert, the elder brother vnto Captaine Rawley Gilbert, who at that time was President of that Councell: But found that the old Captaine Popham was also dead; who was the onely man (indeed) that died there that Winter, wherein they indured the greater excremities; for that, in the depth thereof, their lodgings and stores were burnt, and they thereby wondrously distressed.
            This calamitie and euill newes, together with the resolution that Captaine Gilbert was forced to take for his owne returne, (in that hee was to succeed his brother, in the inheritance of his lands in England) made the whole company to resolue vpon nothing but their returne with the Ships; and for that present to leaue the Countrey againe, hauing in the time of their abode there (notwithstanding the coldnesse of the season, and the small helpe they had) built a prettie Barke of their owne, which serued them to good purpose, as easing them in their returning.
            The arriuall of these people heere in England, was a wonderfull discouragement to all the first vndertakers, in so much as there was no more speech of setling

any other plantation in those parts for a long time after: only Sir Francis Popham hauing the Ships and prouision, which remained of the company, and supplying what was necessary for his purpose, sent diuers times to the coasts for trade and fishing; of whose losse or gaines himselfe is best able to giue account.
            Our people abandoning the plantation in this sort as you haue heard; the Frenchmen immediately tooke the opportunitie to settle themselues within our limits; which being heard of by those of Virginia, that discreetly tooke to their consideration the inconueniences that might arise, by suffering them to harbour there, they dispatched Sir Samuel Argall, with commission to displace them, which hee performed with much discretion, iudgement, valour, and dexteritie. For hauing seized their Forts, which they had built at Mount Mansell, Saint Croix, and Port Reall, he carryed away their Ordnance hee also surprised their Ship, Cattle, and other prouisions, which hee transported to the Collonie in Virginia, to their great benefit. And hereby he hath made a way for the present hopefull plantation to bee made in Noua-Scotia, which we heare his Maiestie hath lately granted to Sir William Alexander Knight, one of his Maiesties most honourable Councell of the Kingdome of Scotland, to bee held of the said Crowne, and that not without some of our priuities, as by approbation vnder writing may and doth appeare. Whereby it is manifest that wee are so farre from making a Monopoly of all those lands belonging to that coast (as hath beene scandalously by some obiected) That we wish that many would vndertake the like.
            In this Interim there were of vs who apprehenedd better hopes of good that might ensue by this attempt, being thereunto perswaded, both by the relations of our

people that had indured the many difficulties whereunto such actions are subiected chiefly in the Winter season; and likewise by the informations giuen them by certaine of the Natiues, that had beene kept a long time in their hands; wherefore we resolued once more to trie the veritie thereof, and to see if possibly we might finde something that might induce a fresh resolution to prosecute a worke so pious and so honourable. And thereupon they dispatched Captaine Hotson, of the Ile of Wight, together with Captaine Herley, Master Iohn Matthew, Master Sturton, with two Saluages, the one called Epenow, the other Manawet, with commission and directions fit for them to obserue and follow, the better to bring to passe what was expected. But as in all humane affaires, there is nothing more certaine, then the vncertaintie thereof; so fell it out in this; for a little before such time as they arriued vpon the coast with the foresaid Sauages, who were Naturalls of those parts, it happened there had beene one Hunt (a worthlesse fellow of our Nation (set out by certaine Merchants for loue of gaine; who (not content with the commoditie he had by the fish, and peaceable trade he found among the Sauages) after hee had made his dispatch, and was ready to set sayle, (more sauagelike then they) seized vpon the poore innocent creatures; that in confidence of his honestie had put themselues into his hands. And stowing them vnder hatches, to the number of twnety foure, carried them into the Straights, where hee sought to sell them for slaues, and sold as many as he could get money for. But when it was vnderstood from whence they were brought, the Friers of those parts tooke the rest from them, and kept them to be instructed in the Christian Faith; and so disappointed this vnworthy fellow of the hopes of gaine he conceiued to make by this new & diuellish project.
            
               
This being knowne by our two Saluages, formerly spoken of, they presently contracted such an hatred against our whole Nation, as they immediatly studied how to be reuenged; and contriued with their friends the best meanes to bring it to passe; but Manawet dying in a short time after the Ships arriuall there, and the other obseruing the good order, and strong guard our people kept, studied only how to free himselfe out of our hands, and thereupon laid the plot very orderly, and indeed effected his purpose, although with so great hazard to himselfe and friends, that laboured his rescue, that Captaine Hobson and his whole company imagined he had beene slaine. And though in the recouery of his body they wounded the Master of our Ship, and diuers other of our company, yet was not their designe without the slaughter of some of their people, and the hurts of other, compassed, as appeared afterward.
            Hereupon Captaine Hobson and his companie, conceiuing the end of their attempt to bee frustrace, resolued without more adoe to returne, and so those hopes, that charge and voyage was lost also, for they brought home nothing but the newes of their euill successe, of the vnfortunate cause thereof, and of a warre now new begunne betweene the inhabitants of those parts, and vs. A miserable comfort for so weake meanes as were now left, to pursue the conclusion of so tedious an enterprise.
            While this was a working, wee found the meanes to send out Captaine Iohn Smith from Plymouth, in a ship, together with Master Darmer and diuers others with him, to lay the foundation of a new Plantation, and to try the fishing of that Coast, and to seeke to settle a trade with the Natiues: But such was his misfortune, as being scarce free of our owne Coast, he had his masts

shaken ouer boord by stormes and tempests, his ship wonderfully distressed, and in that extremity forced to come backe againe; so as the season of the yeere being almost spent, we were of necessitie enforced to furnish him with another ship, and taking out the prouision of the first, dispatched him away againe, who comming to the height of the Westerne Islands, was chased by a French Pirate, and by him made prisoner, although his ship in the night escaped away, and returned home with the losse of much of her prouision, and the ouerthrow of that voyage, to the ruine of that poore Gentleman Captaine Smith, who was detained prisoner by them, and forced to suffer many extremities, before hee got free of his troubles.
            Notwithstanding these disasters, it pleased God so to worke for our incouragement againe, as hee sent into our hands Tasquantum, one of those Saluages that formerly had beene betrayed by this vnworthy Hunt before named, by whose meanes there was hope conceiued to worke a peace betweene vs, and his friends, they being the principall inhabitants of that coast, where the fire was kindled. But this Saluage Tasquantum, being at that time in the New-found land with Captain Mason, Gouernour there for the vndertakers of that Plantation: Master Darmer (who was there also, and sometimes before imployed as we haue said by vs, together with Captaine Iohn Smith) found the meanes to giue vs intelligence of him, and his opinion of the good vse that might be made of his imployment, with the readinesse of Captaine Mason, to further any of our attempts that way, either with boats or other prouision necessary, and resoluing himselfe to goe from thence, aduised vs to send some to meet with him, at our vsuall place of fishing, to aid him in his indeuour, that they ioyning together, might be able to doe what

he hoped would be verie acceptable vnto all well wishers of that businesse.
            Vpon this newes, we dispatched the next season Captaine Rocraft, with a Company for that purpose, in hope to haue met with Captaine Darmer; but the care and discretion of Captaine Mason was such, finding Captaine Darmers resolution to goe beyond his meanes, that hee perswaded him first to goe for England, that prouiding himselfe there, as was requisite, he might proceed in time expedient, which counsell he obserued (as fit it was) although our expectation of his ioyning with Captaine Rocraft was thereby disappointed. Yet so it happened, that Captaine Reoraft at his arriuall in those parts, met with a French Barke that lay in a Creeke a fishing, and trading, which he seized on, and sent home the Master and Company in the same Ship which he went out in.
            With this Barke and his owne Company, hee meant to keepe the Coast that Winter quarter, being very well fitted both with salt, and other necessaries for his turne: but as this was an Act of extremity (the poore man being of our owne Religion) so succeeded it accordingly. For in a short time after, certaine of this Captaines company, conspired together to cut his throat, and to make themselues masters of the whole spoile, and so to seeke a new fortune where they could best make it. This conspiracie being discouered to the Captaine, hee let it goe on, till the time that it should haue beene put in execution, when hee caught them in there owne traine, and so apprehended them in the very instant that they were purposed to beginne their massacre.
            But after he had preuented the mischiefe, and seized vpon the malefactors, hee tooke to his consideration what was best to be done with them. And beeing loth

by himselfe to dispatch them as they deserued, he resolued to put them ashore, thinking by their hazard that it was possible they might discouer something, that might aduance the publike; and so giuing them some Armes for their defense, and some victuall for their sustentation, vntill they knew better how to prouide for themselues, he left them at a place called Sawaguatock, where they remained not long, but got from thence to Menehighon, an Island lying some three leagues in the Sea, and fifteene leagues from that place, where they remained all that Winter, with bad lodging, and worse fare, yet came all safe home saue one sickly man, which dyed there, the rest returned with the Ship wee sent for Rocrafts supply and prouision, to make a fishing voyage.
            After these fellowes were landed, the Captaine finding himselfe but weakely man'd, and his Ship to draw too much water to coast those places, that by his instructions he was assigned to discouer, hee resolued to goe for Virginia where he had liued a long time before, and had (as hee conceiued) many friends, that would helpe him with some things that he had occasion to vse. Arriuing there, he was not deceiued of his expectation; for Sir Samuel Argall being their Gouernour, and one that respected him much for his owne sake, was the readier to helpe him, in regard of the good hee wished to the businesse wherein he was imployed.
            But all this could not preuaile, for after that Sir Samuell Argall came from thence (his departure being more suddaine then was expected) it fell out that the new Gouernour entred the Harbour: and finding Rocraft ready to bee gone, sent to him to command him to come aboord to speake with him, which he readily obeyed, assoone as he could fit his boat and men for that purpose. And so leauing his Barke with her

great Anker a head, and taking with him the halfe of his company, hee was forced to stay aboard the new Gouernours Ship that night. In the meane while a storme arising, our Barke wanting hands to doe their labour, droue a shoare, and there sunke. But yet the Gouernour and Captaine so laboured the next day, when they knew thereof, as that they freed her againe, but that occasion forced our Captaine to stay so long in the Countrey to fit himselfe anew, as in the interim a quarrell fell out betweene him and another of that place; so as Rocraft was slaine, and the Barque sunke the second time, and finally disabled from yeelding vs any benefit to this present.
            But we not knowing this disaster, and Captaine Darmer arriuing with his Saluage out of New-found-land, dispatched him away the next season, in a shippe we sent againe for the fishing businesse, and assigned him a company to ioyne with Rocraft and his people.
            Captaine Darmer arriuing there, and not finding Rocraft, was a little perplexed, and in doubt what to doe: yet hearing by those Mutiners which he found there, that he was gone for Virginia; he was hopefull of his returne; and liued in that expectation, till such time as he heard (by a ship that came from thence to fish for the Collony) the confusion of his fortune, and the end of his misery in this world. Then he determined to take the Pinnace that the yeare before was assigned to Rocraft for him to make the trade with, and with her to proceed on his designe, and so embarked himselfe, and his prouision and company in her. And leauing the fisher-men to their labour, he coasted the shore from thence, searching euery Harbor, and compassing euery Cape-land, till he arriued in Virginia; where he was in hope to meet with some of the prouision, or company of Rocraft, to helpe to supply him of what

he wanted; as also to lay a Decke vpon his Pinnace, that before had not any, and now was taught by experience the necessitie of hauing that defect supplied.
            But those hopes failed him (al being before that time ruined and dispersed) so farre, as he saw it in vaine to hope for help by that means, and therfore attempted to make the best of what hee had of his owne. And going to set his men a worke, they all in a few dayes after their arriuall, fell sicke of a disease which hapned at that time in the country, so as now he was not onely forced to be without hope of their helping of him, but must labor himselfe all he could to attend and sustaine them; but so God fauoured him, that they recouered, and in time conuenient he dispatched his businesse there, and put himselfe to Sea againe, resoluing to accomplish in his iourney backe to New-England, what in his last Discouery he had omitted.
            In his passage he met with certaine Hollanders, who had a trade in Hudsons riuer some yeares before that time, with whom he had conference about the state of that coast, and their proceedings with those people: whose answer gaue him good content. He betooke himselfe to the following of his businesse, discouering many goodly Riuers, and exceeding pleasant, and fruitfull coasts, and Islands, for the space of 80. leagues from East to West, for so that coast doth range along from Hudsons Riuer to Cape Iames.
            Now after we had found by Captaine Rocrafts relation made the yeare before, the hopes he conceiued of the benefits that coast would afford, towards the vpholding of the charge for setling our Plantation by reason of the commodities arising by fishing and furres, if a course might be taken for the mannaging of that businesse, as was fit for such a designe; as well as for the aduancement of the publique good of our whole Nation,

and satisfaction of euery well disposed person, that had a will to be interessed therein.
            It was held to be most conuenient to strengthen our selues by a new Grant to be obtained from his royall Maiestie: the rather, finding that those of Virginia had by two seuerall Patents setled their bounds, and excluded all from intermedling with them that were not free of their Company; and had wholly altered the forme of their Gouernment, from the first ground layed for the managing the affaires of both Collonies, leauing vs as desperate, and our businesse as abandoned.
            These considerations (as is said) together with the necessitie of setling our affaires, bounds and limits, distinct from theirs, made vs resolue to petition his Maiestie for the renewing of our Grant.
            By which time the rumour of our hopes was so publiquely spread abroad, and the commodities of the Fish, and trade so looked into, as it was desired, that all that coast might be made free, as well to those of Virginia, as to vs to make their commoditie: How iust or vniust that motion was, we will not argue, seeing the businesse is ended.
            By this meanes, our preceedings were interrupted, and we questioned about it; first, by the Counsell of Virginia, whom we thought to haue benefully satisfied therein, before we could haue way giuen vs for a new Patent,  hauing beene heard by certaine of the Lords of the Councell; and the businesse by them so ordered,  we were directed to proceed and to haue our Grant agreeable to the libertie of the Virginia Company, the frame of our gouernment excepted; but this order not being liked of, it was againe heard & concluded. Lastly, the Parent being past the Seale, it was stopt vpon new suggestions to the King, and by his Maiestie referred to the Councell to be setled, by whom the former

Orders were confirmed, the difference cleared, and we ordered to haue our Patent deliuered vs.
            These disputes held vs almost two yeeres, so as all men were afraid to ioyne with vs, and we thereby left hopelesse of any thing more, than that which our owne fortunes would yeeld to aduance our proceedings, in which time so many accidents hapned vnto vs at home, and abroad, that wee were faine to giue order by the ships we sent a fishing, for the retiring of Master Darmer, and his people, vntill all things were cleared, and we better prouided of meanes to goe through with our designe: but this worthy Gentleman confident of the good likely to ensue, and resolutely resoluing to pursue the ends he aymed at, could not be perswaded to looke backe, as yet; and so refusing to accept our offer, began againe to prosecute his Discouery, wherein he was betrayed by certaine new Saluages, who sodainly set vpon him, giuing him foureteene or fifteene wounds, but by his valour, and dexteritie of spirit he freed himselfe out of their hands, yet was constrained to retire into Virginia again the second time, for the cure of his wounds, where he fell sicke of the infirmities of that place, and thereof dyed: so ended this worthie Gentleman his dayes, after he had remained in the discouery of that coast two yeares, giuing vs good content in all hee vndertooke; and after he had made the peace between vs and the Saluages, that so much abhorred our Nation, for the wrongs done them by others, as you haue heard: but the fruit of his labour in that behalfe we as yet receiue to our great commoditie, who haue a peaceable plantation at this present among them, where our people both prosper, and liue in good liking, and assurednesse of their neighbours, that had beene formerly so much exasperated against vs, as will more at large appeare hereafter.
            
               
But hauing passed all these stormes abroad, and vndergone so many home-bred oppositions, and freed our Patent, which we were by order of State assigned to renew, for the amendment of some defects therein contained, we were assured of this ground more boldly to proceed on than before; and therefore we tooke first to consideration how to raise the meanes to aduance the plantation. In the examination thereof, two wayes did offer themselues: The one was the voluntary contribution of the Patentees; The other, by an easie ransoming of the freedomes of those that had a will to partake onely of the present profits, arising by the trade, and fishing vpon the coast.
            The first was to proceed from those Noble-men, and others that were Patentees, and they agreed by order among themselues to disburse a hundred pounds a peece, for the aduancement of such necessary busines, as they had in hand.
            The second was to be accomplished by setling such liberties and orders in the westerne cities, and townes, as might induce euery reasonable man, in, and about them, affecting the publike good, or a regular proceeding in the businesse of trade, to embrace an vniformitie, and to ioyne in a communitie, or ioynt stocke together How reasonable, or vnreasonable those orders were, is hereafter to be seene, and iudged by euery well affected person, or any truly louing the publike good of our Nation, whereunto is annexed the difference of trading by a ioynt stocke vnder gouernment and order; and the promiscuous trading without order, and in a dis-joynted manner, as of late they haue done to the infinite preiudice of others already, as also to the losse of many of themselues, that contemptuously and greedily haue leapt into that course, as it were in despight of all Authoritie, whose reward, in time, will follow.
            
               
Before these Orders were to be tendered to those cities and townes, it was desired that there might be letters sent from their Lordships, admonishing them of his Maiesties royall Grant, that prohibiteth any not free of that busines, to intermeddle within our limits, vpon paine of confiscation of ship and goods. These letters expressing withall the good affection of those that were interessed in the businesse, to entertaine any that should be willing to conforme themselues to such orders, as had in that behalfe beene established.
            But those letters how full of Iustice soeuer they appeared, were as distastefull, as was the rumor of Order vnto them: for by it euery particular man thought himselfe strait debarred of libertie to run his owne currant, in which he thought his freedome did onely consist; and by debarring him thereof, his priuate ends were ouerthrowne, which was to endeuour to preuent his neighbour of the market he aimed at, or the Harbour he resolued to goe vnto, or the present trade hee expected to haue by his priuate industrie, but as for the publique hee cared not, let that fare as it would. While these things were in dispute, and likely to haue taken a good foundation, the news of the Parliament flew to all parts, & then the most factious of euery place, presently combined themselues to follow the businesse in Parliament, where they presumed to proue the same to be a Monopolie, and much tending to the preiudice of the common good. But that there should be a conformitie in trade, or a course taken to preuent the euills that were likely to ensue, or to appropriate possessions, or lands, after a generous manner, in remote parts of the world, to certaine publique persons, of the common-wealth, for the taking care, and spending their time and means how to aduance the enlargement of their Countrey, the honour of their King, and glory of their God; these were

thought crimes worthy the taking notice of, and the principall Actors in this kinde, must be first traduced in priuate, then publiquely called vpon in Parliament, to answer such other scandalls as could by malice be inuented.
            But as this businesse was in it selfe iust, and righteous, so was it as earnestly desired, they might haue had the opportunitie to haue answered it before so vnpartiall Iudges, and so reuerend persons; if so it might haue been without offence to the authoritie of his royall Maiestie, that had extended it selfe by vertue of his Prerogatiue so farre off, and without the Lawes of this Realme, and to be put in execution without the publike expence, or charge of the common-wealth, or preiudice to any other former imployments of our Nation, and indeed without offence to any that coueted not to put their sickle into the haruest of other men, or whose enuious & couetous humors stirred them not vp to shame themselues in the conclusion.
            These troubles thus vnfortunately falling out, haue notwithstanding hindered vs from the hopes we had this yeare, to giue some life extraordinarily to those affaires, & therefore we are forced of necessitie to refer the maine of our resolution, till a more conuenient opportunitie, and till we haue gotten our ships and prouision fit to serue our turnes both to giue the Law along those coasts, and to performe such other seruice, as is thereby intended for the publike good of our Aduenturers, and defence of our Marchants, that shall frequent those places, according to such Orders, as shall be found behouefull in that behalfe.
         
         
            
            The Clime and condition of the Country, and the present estate of our affaires there.
            YOu haue heard already the many disasters, calamities, misfortunes, oppositions, and hinderances we haue had, and receiued. Howbeit many are omitted, in that we desire not to trouble the Reader with more than enough; or to affright the minds of weak spirits, that will beleeue there is no better successe to be looked for from such attempts: although it be true that the best designes do oftentimes cary with them the most impediments, whether it be that God will haue it so, to trie our constancie, or otherwise to make vs know, that it is he onely that worketh after his owne will, according to the time he hath assigned, and that there is nothing done but by him, as also that, that is onely best which hee will haue to be done, and that time most proper which he hath assigned for the same.
            But by these you may imagine (seeing we haue none other helps than our owne fortunes to build vpon) there can no great matters bee performed in these stormes and tempests. Notwithstanding, you may know wee haue not beene more hindred one way, than blessed an other: for, as our patience, constancie, trauels and charge hath beene great, so hath it (indeed) manifoldly beene required: For, by GODS fauour, and these Gentlemens industrie; we haue made a most ample discouerie of the most commodious Country for the benefit of our Nation, that euer hath beene found.
            For better satisfaction of the Reader in this behalfe,

we haue thought it fit, by the way, to acquaint him first with the nature of the place where wee haue setled our selues, whereby hee may see reason for what wee haue done, remembring him likewise, that in settling of plantations, there is principally to be considered: The aire, for the health of the Inhabitants. The soile, for fertilitie fit for corne, and feeding of cattle wherewith to sustaine them The Sea, for commoditie of trade and commerce, the better to enrich their publique and priuate State, as it shall grow to perfection, and to raise imployments, to furnish the course of those affaires.
            Now for the quality of the Aire, there is none of iudgement but knowes it proceedeth either from the generall disposition of the Sphere, or from the particular constitution of the place.
            Touching the disposition of the Sphere, it is not onely seated in the temperate Zone, but as it were in the Center, or middle part thereof, for that the middle part of that Country hath about three hundred and ten degrees of Longitude; and stands in the forty fourth and forty fifth degrees of the Northerne Latitude, that is, twenty degrees from the fiery Tropicke, and as much from the freesing Articke Circle: Vnder the same climate and course of the Sunne that Constantinople, and Rome, the Ladies of the World; Italy, and France, the Gardens of Europe, haue their situation, within the limits of the fifth and sixt Climate, after the later computation; hauing their longest day fifteene houres and some odde minutes.
            Touching the constitution of the place (which is about sixty two degrees by Sea from our Continent Westerly) The Maritine parts thereof are somewhat colder, then the nature of the Clime otherwise affordeth; for that the beames of the Sunne are weakned, partly by the vnstable reflection of the same vpon the

Sea, and partly by beeing laden with abundance of moisture it exhales out of the vast Ocean, whereby the nature thereof is not so violently there expressed, as in the like parallel further into the maine is accustomed. Nor is that Sea coast so subiect to droughts or want of raine in seasonable times, as other parts are of like Latitudes, and by that reason the Sea coasts are at all times more cold then is the Inland. And the Easterne coast which receiueth the rising of the Sunne, is likewise colder then are the Westerne parts, towards the declining of the same, as our morning aires (for example) euen in the heat of Summer are cold and quicke, when the day and euening are very sweltring. And this makes those parts more sutable to the nature of our people, who neither finde content in the colder Climates, nor health in the hotter; but (as hearbs and plants) affect their natiue temperature, and prosper kindly no where else.
            And indeed, the hot Countreys yeeld sharper wits, but weaker bodies, and fewer children; the colder, more slow of conceit, but stronger of body, and more abounding in procreation. So that, though the inuention of Arts hath risen from the Southerne Nations, yet they haue still beene subiect to the inundations, and inuasions of the more Northerly people, by reason of their multitudes, together with the strength of their body, and hardnesse of their constitutions.
            But this Country, what by the generall and particular situation, is so temperate, as it seemeth to hold the golden meane, and indeed is most agreeable to the nature of our owne, which is made manifest by experience, the most infallible proofe of all assertions; in so much as our people that are setled there, enioy their life and health much more happily,

then in other places; which can bee imputed to no other cause, then the temperature of the Climate.
            Now, as the Clime is found to bee so temperate, so delicate, and healthfull, both by reason and experience; such is the soile also, some parts thereof yeelding wonderfull increase, both of the Corne, the Natiues haue most vse of; as also of our owne, of all sorts: with infinite variety of nourishing roots, and other herbes, and fruits, common among them, but rare with vs.
            Besides, the Coast doth abound with most conuenient Hauens, and Harbors, full of singular Islands, fit for Plantation; replenished with Plants and Wood of all sorts; as Oake, Cedars, Spruce, Firre, Pyne, Walnut, Chestnut, Elme, Sassafras, Plumtrees, and Calamus Aromaticus, &c.
            The people are tractable (if they bee not abused) to commerce and Trade withall, and as yet haue good respect of vs. The Seas are stored with all kindes of excellent fish, and in many places vpon the coast, fit to make Salt in. The Country aboundeth with diuersity of wild foule, as Turkeys, Partriges, Swans, Cranes, wilde Geese of two sorts, wilde Duckes of three sorts, many Doues, especially when Strawberies are ripe.
            There are seuerall sorts of Deere in those parts, and some that bring forth two, three, and foure young at once, which is a manifest proofe of the fertility of the Soile, or temper of the Clime, or both together.
            There is also a certaine Beast, that the Natiues call a Mosse, hee is as big bodied as an Oxe, headed like a fallow Deere, with a broad Palme, which hee mues euery yeere, as doth the Deere, and necke like a Red Deere, with a short mane, running downe along the raines of his backe, his haire long like an Elke, but

esteemed to be better then that for Sadlers vse, he hath likewise a great bunch hanging downÌ„e vnder his throat, and is of the colour of our blacker sort of fallow Deere, his legges are long, and his feet as bigge as the feet of our Oxen, his taile is longer then the single of a Deere, and reacheth almost downe to his huxens, his skinne maketh very good Buffe, and his flesh is excellent good food, which the Natiues vse to Ierkin and keepe all the yeere to serue their turne, and so prooues very seruiceable for their vse. There haue beene many of them seene in a great Island vpon the Coast, called by our people Mount Mansell, whither the Saluages goe at certaine seasons to hunt them; the manner whereof is, by making of seuerall fires, and setting the Countrey with people, to force them into the Sea, to which they are naturally addicted, and then there are others that attend them in their Botes with bowes and weapons of seuerall kindes, wherewith they slay and take at their pleasure. And there is hope that this kinde of Beasts may bee made seruiceable for ordinary labour with Art and Industry.
            The knowne Commodities of that Country, are Fish of seuerall sorts, rich Furres, as Beauers, Otters, Martins, blacke Fox, Sables, &c. There are likewise plenty of Vines, of three kindes, and those pleasant to the taste, yet some better then other. There is Hempe, Flax, Silkgrasse, seuerall veines of Ironstone, commodities to make Pitch, Rosen, Tarre; Deale boords of all sorts, Sparres, Masts, for Ships of all burdens; in a word, there comes no commodity out of France, Germany, or the Sound, but may be had there, with reasonable labour and industry.
            Further, wee haue setled at this present, seuerall Plantations along the Coast, and haue granted patents to many more that are in preparation to bee gone with

all conueniencie. Those of our people that are there, haue both health and plenty, so as they acknowledge there is no want of any thing, but of industrious people, to reape the commodities that are there to be had, and they are indeed so much affected to the place, as they are loth to be drawne from thence, although they were directed to returne to giue satisfaction to those that sent them, but chose rather to performe that office by letters, together with their excuse, for breach of their duty in that behalfe. And thus you see there is no labour well imployed, but hath his reward at one time or other.
            These incouragements haue imboldned vs to proceed, to the ingaging of our selues, for the building of some Ships of good burden, and extraordinary Mould, to lie vpon the Coast for the defense of Merchants and Fishermen, that are imployed there, as also to Waft the Fleets, as they goe to and from their Markets: and we purpose from henceforth to build our shipping there, where wee find all commodities fit for that seruice, together with the most opportune places, that can bee desired.
            Lastly, finding that wee haue so far forth preuailed, as to winde our selues into familiarity with the Natiues, (which are in no great number) along the Coast for two hundred Leagues together, wee haue now dispatched some of our people of purpose, to diue into the bowels of the Continent, there to search and finde out what Port, or Place, is most conuenient to settle our maine Plantation in, where wee meane to make the Residencie of our State and Gouernment, as also to bee assured, what other commodities may be raised for the publique, and priuate benefit of those that are dealers in that businesse, and willing to bee interessed in any the Lands there: Whither is gone this yeere already,

for vs to vary from it, and therefore we haue resolued to build our Edifices vpon it, and to frame the same after the platforme already layd, and from whence wee take our denomination. So as we purpose to commit the managing of our whole affaires there in generall, vnto a Gouernour, to be assisted by the aduice and counsel of so many of the Patentees as shall be there resident, together with the Officers of State, that is to say; The Treasurer for the managing of the treasure and reuenues belonging to that State. The Martiall for matters of Armes, and affaires of warres, be it defensiue or offensiue. The Admirall for maritine businesse ciuill or criminall, and the forces belonging to the Sea. The master of the ordnance for munition, artillery and other prouisions for publique store of Armies by Sea or Land; as also such other persons of iudgement and experience, as by the President and Counsell established here, for the better gouerning of those affaires shall be thought fit.
            By this Head, and these Members, vnited together, the great affaires of the whole State is to be managed, according to their seuerall authorities, giuen them from their Superiours, the President and Councell established as aforesaid.
            And for that all men by nature are best pleased to be their owne caruers, and doe most willingly submit to those Ordinances, or Orders whereof themselues are authors: it is therefore resolued, that the generall lawes whereby that State is to be gouerned, shall be first framed and agreed vpon by the generall assembly of the States of those parts, both Spirituall and Temporall.
            For the better distinction whereof, and the more orderly proceeding, agreeable (as is said) to the present State of this our Realme, two parts of the whole Territorie is to be diuided betweene the Patentees, into seuerall

Counties, to be by themselues or their friends planted, at their pleasure or best commoditie. The other third part is to be reserued for publique vses, to be belonging to the State, as their reuenew for defraying of publique charge.
            But as well this third part, as the two formerly spoken of, is to be diuided into Counties, Baronries, Hundreds, and the like, from all which the Deputies for euery County, and Baronry, are to be sent in the name and behalfe of the Subiects, vnder them to consult and agree vpon the Lawes so to be framed, as also to reforme any notable abuses committed in former proceedings.
            Yet these are not to be assembled, but by order from the President and Councell heere, who are to giue life to the Lawes so to be made, as those to whom of right it best belongs, according to his Maiesties royall grant in that behalfe, as also that vnder God, and his Sacred Highnesse, they are the principall Authors of that foundation. And thus much for the generall forme of our Gouernment.
            In like manner are the Counties to be gouerned by the chiefe Head or Deputy thereof with other Officers vnder him. As his Steward, Comptroller, Treasurer of his reuenews; and so the Baronries by their Stewards, and other inferiour ministers, who are to haue assigned them the power of high and low Iustice within themselues for determining of Controuersies, with reseruation of Appeale in some cases to the supreme Courts.
            And further, these Lords of Counties may of themselues subdiuide their said County into Mannors and Lordships, as to them shall seeme best, giuing to the Lords thereof power of keeping of Courts, and L, as is heere vsed in England, for the determining of petty

matters, arising betweene the Lords, and the Tenants, or any other.
            And there is no lesse care to be taken for the trade and publique commerce of Merchants, whose gouernment ought to be within themselues, in respect of the seuerall occasions arising betweene them, the trades-men, and  Mechanickes, with whom they haue most to doe: and who are generally the chiefe inhabitants of great Citties, and Townes, in all parts; it is likewise prouided, that all the Cities in that Territory, and other inferiour Townes where Trades-men are in any numbers, shall be incorporate and made bodies politique, to gouerne their affaires and people as it shall be found most behouefull for the publique good of the same; according vnto the greatnes or capacity of them, who shall be made likewise capable to send certaine their Deputies, or Burgesses to this publique assembly, as members thereof, and who shall haue voyces equall with any the rest.
            BY this you see our maine drift is but to take care for the well ordering of the businesse, seeking by all meanes to auoyd (what we may) the intermedling with any mens monies, or disposing of any mens fortunes, saue onely our owne; leauing to euery particular vndertaker the imployment of their aduentures, and the raising of their profits, out of their proper limits, and possessions, as shall seeme best to themselues, or their officers, or ministers, whom they imploy, and whom they may be bold to question, or displace, as to themselues shall seeme most fitting.
            And hereby all men may know, that as it is not in our wills to delude and deceiue any, so wee are carefull not to giue the least cause of suspicion of any euill in that kinde; so much the rather for that wee daily see by experience,

the abuses committed in like cases by inferiour ministers, to be a notable cause to dehort the good dispositions of many otherwise well affected to Plantations, for that they obserue those that are so imployed to grow rich, and their aduentures to come to nothing.
            And wee further desire that all men should bee perswaded, wee couet not to engrosse any thing at all vnto ourselues, but that wee should bee exceeding glad to finde more of our Nation, so free in disposition, as to partake with vs, as well in the profit, as in the future trauell, and charge thereof; without looking backe to our expence, or labour already past, to the end that all our hands being vnited together, the worke may bee so much the sooner aduanced, well knowing and freely confessing, that it is sufficient to giue content to a multitude, and that of all sorts. For such as are truely Pious, shall finde heere the opportunity to put in practise the workes of piety, both in building of Churches, and raising of Colledges for the breeding of youth, or maintenance of Diuines and other learned men. If they be such as affect Glory, and to continue their memory to future ages, they may haue heere the meanes to raise Houses, Parishes, yea Townes, or Prouinces, to their Names and Posterity. Doe they aime at wealth? heere is the way for their industry to satiate their appetites in that, if they be not vnsatiable. Doe they long after pleasure? here is as much to be had as may content any, not meerely voluptuous, or onely prodigall. Doe they aspire to be Commanders? here is the place where they may haue command of their owne friends, or tenants, if they be of any worth, or meanes extraordinary wherewith to transport any numbers. If otherwise of experience and vertue, it is likely they may attaine places of gouernement for the publique State. So as you see there wants no occasions, or opportunity to inuite, or

giue satisfaction to such as haue patience to attend the time.
            And indeed we shall be glad, that this, or any thing else may induce a free and noble resolution, in any well affected person, to endeuour the aduancement of these ends, together with vs, in that they shall finde them agreeable to honour, and honestie; and if there bee any that can adde ought vnto our endeuours, by their aduice or otherwise, there is none that shall more readily embrace the same then wee; whose intents are onely framed for the prosperity of the businesse, as is already said, and as we hope will all those be, that shall assent to ioyne with vs, both in the labor, profit, and honour, without respect to the weakenesse of the motiue, by which it hath beene heeretofore mooued, or any thing saue the worke it selfe. For by it you shall finde the Honour of our God, our King, and Nation, will bee aduanced, without effusion of Christian bloud, or question of wrong to the present Inhabitants. For that they themselues both desire it, & we inteÌ„d not to take ought, but what they that are there, are willing wee should bee seized of, both for the defence of them against their Enemies, and their preseruation in peace among themselues, & propagation of the Christian Faith, which with wonderfull alacrity many of them seeme to giue care vnto, and for whose speedy conuersion wee intend to bee as carefull as of our owne happinesse; and as diligent to build them houses, and to prouide them Tutors for their breeding, and bringing vp of their children, of both sects, as to aduance any other businesse whatsoeuer, for that wee acknowledge our selues specially bound thereunto. And this being done, to referre the successe, to the Author of Heauen and Earth, to whom be all Honour and glory.
         
         FINIS.
